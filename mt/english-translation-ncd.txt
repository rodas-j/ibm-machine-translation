i like question to the Leader of the government to the Senate once issue Act a topic which him keeps to heart et which me keeps to heart since of many years .
confirms ago truck to health Corporation of development of the Cape - Cape , health Devco .
i know that the hon. Senator the also strong that the Senator Graham asset defend health Devco , of the less I the hope .
my issue apply states to health situation to health mine of coal of Phalen .
lights is favour emerging of démonter health line of - et people levels research of la mine .
transport miners the that health social Superior of la mine of Phalen not arranged not the , because lights there wherever still approximately 7,5 million of tonnes of coal whose between 5 et 6 million of tonnes of coal récupérable contained people sectors 1A southwestern , 2A southwestern , 1QZ , 2QZ , thereby that 1Y et 2Y .
health compelling was the Reference America et people other from parties to health Devco , that the government federal , good of people allowing operating health mine to the dissimilar of people next years , sooner that people miners qualified contribute a number total of years asset wheel right to their Superannuation to health end of la period of two years .
otherwise , health mine arranged may et people workers not stay not right to their Superannuation .
the Leader of the government to the Senate the he , beginning that possible , endorsed issue with the Prime Minister , sooner that people miners qualified continue of contribute to health mine of coal of Phalen et of operating these 5 to 6 million of tonnes of coal récupérable ?
the hon. J . in Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) :

the Senator Buchanan :
what is right , et you obteniez always health right response .
the Senator Boudreau :
the hon. Senator coming may - perhaps health situation Current more pleasant .
before of respond to health question of the hon. Senator , I like 209 people observations appointments everyone to the hour .
what is with lot of of that I I accepted people responsibilities which me resulted been confiées , of tree more that my development people ago federal of manner remarkable .
i widow of elsewhere the favour thanking to the behalf of the Senate et of la population of the Canada .

i him observance that , to what topic , he ago the support total of my wife .
accordingly response to health question raised by the hon. Senator Buchanan , I the that health Devco arranged to the centre of condolences concerns during whole health length of my mandate Present .
we know all two the file since once period large .
he fact currently the subject of once approach favour two process .
health first challenge to find once solution hon. asset people resources Resources which call contained what sector since of many years .
endorsed issue an once vast importance non only asset these people , but also asset all people senators et asset the government of the Canada .
the another reading , well course , challenge to promote the development economic asset assist health community to apply adapt to health Transition favour dissimilar .
human not knows better that the Senator which ago jurist health question that he apply notional headed of once sympathy Transition between once economy industrial which is the of a uniqueness employer et once economy deficit - Taiwan .
once ceremony Transition not is never easy .
accordingly what which motivator la question proprement Prime , I I course endorsed concern .
i right however that health approach which VI to ports people resources to a exploitant of the sector private is favour dissimilar .
everyone the world seems apply hear asset say that he apply the of la wish manner of strategy to health situation .
if people resources houillères arresting perhaps the et are certainly , efficient et likely , I am number that the Insignia exploitant of the sector private committee health proposal very seriously .
the Senator Buchanan :
honourable senators , I not about not of la privatization .
i I my milled view to bearer regard .
the problem that questions people 5 to 6 million of tonnes of coal récupérable , what is that , if health leadership of Devco member to limit health line of - until to people sections higher of la houillère Phalen et task - deserved , he risk of perhaps too later asset that a exploitant of the sector private incurred the what coal .
if a exploitant of the sector private so to the do , what is very well , but he 50 Robbie that people miners which agreements what work to the dissimilar of people two next years qualified perhaps always plan to people benefits of retirement .
as the hon. Senator the knows , with la closure of la mine Phalen , a orator number of miners not are not including contained health basic regarding the program of by to health retirement . .
health mine Phalen ago more before that human not retain plan dapper closure et what is the problem which we occupies currently .
i like also send the Senator to the topic of people someone 1 160 miners which manage affected by health closure of la mine Phalen .
the process of évincement ago already began with la houillère Prince .
transport men which resulted been Coast when health mine Phalen ago more et those which apply leading of the maintenance of endorsed mine resulted évincé people workers of la houillère Prince , whose approximately 250 resulted received their notice of implementation to foot .
when lights Civil these men - side to people other , confirms fact someone 1 % miners which not , no Benefit of retirement , there including those which resulted 20 years of the , but which not are not enough they asset wheel 75 points .

they not arresting the do without once assistance how favour 1910 of education .
the University Memorial of Newfoundland - Newfoundland famous , Ambassador 99 , his fiftieth anniversary favour activist that predatory base . of people diplômes .
since 1950 years , the University Memorial ago played a role road contained the development of Newfoundland - Newfoundland et of the Labrador .
even if the access to a Secondary of quality dispensé by the University Memorial et by of other institutions university et collégiaux of the Canada apply is continuing to the incorrigible of people years , of many students of Newfoundland - Newfoundland et of everywhere to the Canada not arresting attendance of people studies post to untold of barriers Include as the lack of fund et people costs of tuition high .
from many other are forced of drop strip studies before of people wheel three to untold of problems as the enormous debt of people students .
honourable senators , I known these problems asset people wheel vécus personally .
without health fortunate extraordinary that ago centre asset finer health tuition gratuite instaurée contained people years 60 by the Prime Minister main of the era et his government , I think that I not pleased not favour extent of do endorsed intervention to the Senate today today .
fortunately , good number of people investment which resulted been help contained the speech of the another et which points to improve health productivity et to stop against the paid of people funding manage orientés toward people universities Forces , to the support of people activities of research et development contained of people areas as people care of health et health upper Technology .
the to of people initiatives as the Fund of right of people scholarships of studies of the millennium , these new resources part address to tribute the Secondary post more accessible to people students .
asset power follow once training avancée , people children must power very contained a considerable course where strip needs basic are say et they must perhaps find to apply the et to benefit to the reduced of strip studies living et high .

if the Canada wants success Act people professional Housing et economic contained the future , he him tangibly come to across of la poverty home people children .
honourable senators , as lights the ago seen enough plainly contained the speech of the another , health condition of people children is to the order of the day of people concerns of the government .

honourable senators , we to Newfoundland - Newfoundland know better that anyone that when the balance of la nature is bousculé , people repercussions Act people people arresting perhaps dévastatrices et of vast government .
what is therefore with lot of enthusiasm that I have people efforts of the government favour standpoint of protect the integrity of our systems long .
thanks to of people measures designed to reduce the Minutes of gas directly et to adopt of people regulations of together Act people cash if of preference , the Canada arranged favour extent of meet coloured commitments opposite to people generations future favour what which ago truck to health , of our history natural .
honourable senators , to the dissimilar of la campaign election of 1997 , the government ago promised to people Canadians that health half of the the budget citing set to of new Estimates contained people priorities payroll et that the another half citing the between of people , of Proposed , et the Customs of la debt national .

once approach continue is cooperation contained the economy mondialisée of today today , once economy which apply do quickly et which is favour , evolution .
transport powers Public must therefore perhaps more flexibles et whatever of adopt more of respect strategic opposite to people challenges .
what is importance if we want adhérer to these values which we bring of the rest of the world .
accordingly our quality of parliamentarians , we must need et various all people orders of government to not never meaning of standpoint people main values Forces which we distinguent , because apply he continues of there points of people civilian - asset - account contained our society , run he continues of there wheel of people children commitment , run he continues of there wheel a lack of care of health asset our suffering et our persons elderly et apply he continues of there wheel of people the , engineers of people made , contained our systems of education , sending not parviennent not to provide of people wish provinces to all people Canadians , what is whole health society which favour can .

transport provinces marine - Assessment judgment of la Court Supreme confirmant people rights of fishing aboriginal
the hon. Lowell Murray :
honourable senators , I you chamber of you show a little indulgents , the time that I visit a word Act la situation which ago dissimilar contained the sector of people fisheries Act la Coast is .
singing people recent new , et I confess regional that I me favour the almost tobacco to people bulletins of press of what morning , people leaders seem wheel she to the the of 30 days that they sons since to meet .
always of after people account outstanding of press of the debate which ago strokes instead to the another place yesterday night , he seems that the Minister of people Fisheries , Mr. Dhaliwal , took summer taken by knew by endorsed new , everything as the government is loss colleagues the , he there ago four weeks , when health Court Supreme of the Canada took realized dapper decision .
far of finer the idea , honourable senators , of me raise favour constitutional jurist et still less favour interprète of the judgment of la Court Supreme of the Canada , but health statement eye by a of people leaders what morning , according commentary him et coloured colleagues apply the the right of potential strip own activities of fishing , is , to my opinion opinion , contrary to the judgment realized by health Court Supreme of the Canada .
Roberta health decision The , the Justice Binnie fact Into of :
... health scope very of the right the of the treaty .
he written rejecting :
the right the of the treaty is a right réglementé which may , by settlement , perhaps circonscrit to coloured limits Kyoto .
from people limits of taken , whose he citing reasonable of apply wait to what that firms amounts to people families mi' kmaq of apply ensure once close decision according people standards of today today , arresting perhaps until by settlement et tell without bringing maintained to the right the of the treaty .
a becomes settlement the what right et the not once maintained which should perhaps , following health standard established contained the v. Badger .
honourable senators , he me seems that these statements are once invitation lancée by health Court Supreme of the Canada to the government order that he move an settlement .
when the Justice fact reference to the settlement , to people limits of captures et to the rate of a settlement , he there ago instead of might that he talking of a settlement which citing proposed by the government .
he there ago approximately two weeks , the Prime Minister avoided said that the government the of ask to health Court Supreme of surseoir to his judgment .
more recently , the Minister of people Fisheries apply favour is taken to people Members of the Opposition which the health same something .
i thought that the government ago examined et turned the road of ask of surseoir to the judgment et that endorsed road ago summer provincial .
he me seems therefore that everyone what that he rest to do to the government , what is of introduce once extent legislative or a settlement , or people two .
accordingly addition , the government should consider of Refer the settlement favour issue directly to health Court Supreme asset ensure to what that he authorized well that with the judgment realized by endorsed last .
i doubt strong that people aboriginal apply the of less of confirms .
no regardless breaching settlement which arranged tabled arranged the question et show mood by the together of the process judicial .
i estimated order that the government whole a becomes settlement to health Court Supreme of the Canada .
honourable senators , if I saying confirms , what is simply because that health situation apply worsening of day favour day .
without whatever perhaps the , I think that we not impotent that too know of people incidents violent which apply are products contained health region et are to health investment of apply produce .
a vacuum legal ago summer created .
from other resulted peoples what vacuum created by health Court Supreme of the Canada Reorganizationand he me seems that enough paving perhaps the planned .

the hon. John Lynch - Staunton ( cc of the Opposition ) :
i believe that he is only logical that what paragraph authorized réinséré contained the mandate .
the comit ago held of people hearings to the dissimilar changes he ago heard various officials of the government , he ago pleasant of people senior senior of people forces Armed , whose certain were favour Bosnia , various experts of the Continuation of la peace , of people historians , the ambassador of the Canada to the NATO et lot of coloured colleagues , activist civilians that military .
he ago pleasant the Secretary General of the NATO which ago fixed his station recently et of other officials officials .
he ago fact lot of researching et support lot of information , whose health distraught part help to health dispute of the report final .
transport witnesses key which still , what is - to - say which not are not précisés contained the mandate , are the Minister of people Foreign Foreign , the Minister of la National national et the Opposition of Into - Chief of la National , which are people witnesses that he citing the more logical of hear before of implement end to people hearings .
i move therefore a amendment which , I the hope , namely the support of the Senate .
he suivrait the paragraph 2 of la motion whose we impotent before .
motion of amendment
the hon. John Lynch - Staunton ( cc of the Opposition ) :
by therefore , I move , supported by the Senator Kinsella :
that the comit the , between other witnesses , the Minister of people Foreign Foreign , the Minister of la National national et the Opposition of Into - Chief of la National .
the hon. Fernand Robichaud ( His Hon. the chairman Acting ) :
your - he to people honourable senators of adopt health motion of amendment ?
the hon. Dan Hays ( Leader Deputy of the government ) :
honourable senators , health motion ceremony that she guardian meetings of la sessional certain guardian enough Canadian , with people names of people ministers et of people other officials that the comit wanted hear .
these names not are not précisés contained health motion Current favour part to untold of the respond given to the comit asset do report et of la Availability of people ministers et of people other persons out contained health motion technical .
i écouterai carefully people arguments of the Senator Stewart , but I believe that what are headed people prices reasons asset reasons health motion is as she is .
well course , confirms not means not that the comit not may not evidence these persons et of other witnesses apply he the widow .
i not know too why the comit not ago not already heard these persons , if what not is that coloured work resulted been of by health was .
i know substandard are people suggest of the comit .
i hope , as the ago said the Senator Prud man , that the comit . the Senator Stewart as chairman .
i I understood that the comit Partnerships the intent of three coloured work early today today .
he apply could very well that all people persons in contained health motion original viability convoquées et other .
he apply could also , displaced of people reasons provincial of la strongly of the comit or of the Senate , that these persons not viability not available .
from after what that I understand of the rule of the Senate , we assistance a problem if these persons not sons not been other the 18 November , authorized to health date majority asset health Presented of the report .
what is asset confirms that health motion ago summer a as she the is .
the hon. ë A . Kinsella ( cc Deputy of the Opposition ) :
honourable senators , Ambassador activist that for of la motion holds , I wherever that the amendment proposed améliorerait endorsed motion .
i there takers once motion pride .
she not knew not the number of persons that the comit may hear , but she look 22 - side to hear , between other , the Minister of people Foreign Foreign , the Minister of la National national et the Opposition of Into - Chief of la National .
given given the work the by the comit meetings of la last sessional et account held of la quality of his work , I pleased very Foreign that he not Justice not necessary of hear people three persons situation asset power finishing coloured work .
i want finer also with look of hear the Senator Stewart .
the hon. John B . Stewart :
honourable senators , lights already that health decision that participate the comit to the topic of dapper Ruling when he apply matter not arranged may - perhaps not floor .
however , let confirms asset the payment .
i this with the Senator Lynch - Staunton that the comit ago reformed a work extremely fouillé et useful .
the work which ago summer accomplished to the dissimilar of la last postponement fact certainly raises health need of hear the Minister of people Foreign Foreign .
he fact raises , Joe less impérativement , health need of hear the Minister of la National national .
health same something worth asset the Opposition of Into - Chief of la National .
otherwise said , I am fully of agreed with la seams of la motion of amendment of the Senator Lynch - Staunton .
Seneca once another reason asset commentary the comit should hear these three persons .
the speech of the another , which ago summer read more earlier endorsed week , cause almost the comit to hear people ministers .
the government funding once importance ill to health security tragedy contained dapper political foreign et he oeuvrera asset that people local international are of people progress the contained the framework of once approach International asset health security tragedy .
we we already heard confirms of la share of the Present Minister of people Foreign Foreign , but now , what is health Gouverneure general which the said to the behalf of the government .
he is obviously that the comit show entendreM. Axworthy when he favour what to endorsed reading of his work .
a another paragraph of the speech of the another attention our attention , et I quote to new :
the government continue also of ensure to what that people Forces Forces viability favour extent of support the role of the Canada asset contributing to health security contained the world et he apply efforcera of increase health ability of people Canadians et of people mandate of assist to ensure health peace et health security contained of people country foreign .
he me seems that health human that the comit must hear headed - dealt is the Minister of la National national , health human outside of the Department .
i not takers not how the comit may do report without wheel heard these witnesses - provincial two ministers to everyone the less .
however , I not dispel not speak to the behalf of the comit .
i favour just now to the standpoint raised by the Senator Hays .
whereupon that he favour authorized , health date of the 18 November serving contained health motion .
the problem refers the exercise of the government to the Senate is purpose , what is that the Senate could strong well apply find contained once situation impossible - of once share , a respond March et , of another share , the insistance that three representatives favour particular viability hour .
if what is the case , the respond should perhaps considered as rules .
wishes , we close a big problem .
honourable senators , I think that the comit explain hear to the less two ministers , et probably health human to commentary lights ago fact reference .
singing my notice , confirms not fact nil doubt .
the problem refers we impotent witness is , of once 800 manner , a problem of form , to whether : can - we the do contained the time disposable ?
if endorsed provision is ' , he is strong possible that the comit show ask once extension task - deserved of the 18 November .
hence health situation ceremony that I health understand .
the hon. Nicholas W . Taylor :
honourable senators , I query take a payment asset express my support to health motion of amendment Proposed by the another side .
ask to the comit of report a report without wheel heard the Minister of people Foreign Foreign , the Minister of la National national et the Opposition of Into - Chief - the Senator Stewart , which is a became all , arranged of agreed with finer - citing a little as the of the gruau without sel .
me Chair opposed more earlier endorsed year to the intervention to the Kosovo , I estimated that he is important that we , the the which Subcommittee - 8 our role contained people Affairs Foreign et the the which must perhaps the ours contained the future .
honourable senators , I I recently speech a speech to the behalf of the hon. David Kilgour , Secretary of state ( America Latin et Africa ) , Before once class of graduates favour Science political , to Calgary .
booted . Kilgour me Partnerships given health permission of express condolences own what .
i I taken health freedom of speak contained the sense of people comments held by the Senator Stewart , to whether that the future arranged conditionné lot more by health security personal or tragedy that by health security national .
health most of people means which are federal to the dissimilar of people 20 recent years resulted been of people means civilian et non of people conflict between States .
what is almost as a who favour council , Ambassador what sense that we we . to do participate our soldiers .
Roberta the case of the Kosovo , breaching type of logical could justify the commitment of our forces Armed asset Iraq of people women et of people children innocent , of the odyssey fact that a country ago elected health concerned human asset conduct his government ?
i know that I opportunity of the opportunity asset just the file of the Kosovo , et I not me favour regarding not .
however , even if I not am not member of the comit of people Affairs Foreign , I account attend to few sittings et question of people issues to people various witnesses .
Roberta the case of a topic also important that the conveyance of our military asset looking of people missions of police without the approval of the Parliament , why confirms not should - he not do the subject of a review review ?
health date knew of the 18 November is complete artificielle .
i supports of everyone heart health motion of amendment .
the hon. A . Raynell Andreychuk :
honourable senators , I believe that health motion of amendment would the comit , because she témoignerait of la strongly of the Senate of encourage people ministers to apply introduce Before the comit .
i understand perfectly that he incurred perhaps difficult asset a chairman of ask to people ministers of come evidence , Ambassador reason of their employment of the time charged , but if confirms serving contained the mandate of the comit , confirms the more of authority to the chairman .
if , displaced once reason impérative , a Minister or the Opposition of Into - Chief not achieved subpoenas Before the comit , as we we the intent of people various to the do , he the to the comit of decide what that he ground of do to what payment - headed .
staffing he revert ask once extension of our mandate or basis - we libérés of endorsed condition asset the Tabled of our report ?
i believe that what is thus that he tangibly address the problem .
he apply wherever that people words contained compete the mandate is wording me , , because they new more of authority to the chairman .
the Senator Hays :
honourable senators , after wheel listened the debate , we , of what side - side , the the amendment allowing to the comit of hear these other witnesses .
ownership to health date of Tabled of the report , Ambassador activist that chairman of Committee , I not I never strokes of difficulty to revert ask to the Senate once extension of the time can asset deal of once issue whose the comit Partnerships been before , et I am sure that he favour arranged thus asset the comit of people Affairs Foreign apply he ago need of once extension .
the hon. Marcel Prud man :
honourable senators , we we legal contained health same situation that favour 1984 , when the government ago short create a Institute asset health peace et health security .
everyone the world Tisserant that what guardian totally impossible .
lot were against health creation of a becomes being because that , yet - they , what guardian a do of departure asset the Prime Minister Trudeau .
i not route not of agreed .
singing the era , I route chairman of the comit of la defence national et of people Affairs regulatory to health chamber des people Commons et we recall 30 members to purpose .

he there ago now positions years that we we learning the right of perhaps palatable as of people persons .
well that I not me as not to what that the lights Friday that we convinced before that we devenions of people persons , I know however that perhaps once human not ago not still the same members that perhaps a man .
the number of women us contained endorsed chamber et contained the another place is asset finer once source of recognition et of by .
their determination , their strongly , their intellect et their mind constitute of people apports there asset our country .
yet , how forget that we impotent still if little ?
Roberta endorsed chamber , our colleagues masculins continues of we the favour number , to reason of two asset once .
everyone favour we the of the fact that the Senate of the Canada authorized the fifth of the world asset what which is of la representation care , we not can certainly not we talk of the Into Present of people things .
he rest of many barriers to health involvement of people women contained of if many this of our life economic et political .
i I should of different once , contained endorsed chamber et elsewhere , people difficulties reflect people women are confrontées when firms apply the favour political .
yet , without once representation how of people women et of people other groups contained our institutions political , how can - we we targuer of democracy ?
therefore , to the payment where we victories endorsed Success cooperation that ago summer the affair " human " et everyone what that she ago " asset of people generations of Canadians , sachons that we not we not still balance the purpose .
if people five being militantes were with we , firms continueraient of apply called asset the equality .
because that , today today still , we advanced of people does between people persons : between people men et people women , between people off et people poor , between people young et people old , between health majority et people minorities .

despite people Conventions international allowing health forward of people esclaves humans , what type of Business thing is favour net .
confirms apply let favour part because that he is relatively easy of do the traffic of effects humans .
often , people persons bad the subject of traffic not apply duty not account that firms are favour danger et traversent . health border asset remedy contained a another country .
he is less likely that people RCMP of la peace hear of people , contained people case of traffic of effects humans that contained people case of rather of growth et of weapons to gun .
he is victims of see that the orator case that the lights fact of people young awarded once asking ability asset do of new . home people women more young et people children .
the traffic of effects humans presented a risk asset health security , because people natural progress thanks to the exploitation of effects humans serving often to secondary people organizations from .
accordingly Asia , contained health region of the Mékong , the traffic of people effects humans rivalise now of interest with the traffic of growth to people influence of the Crime organized .
from same , contained of other regions instables , as contained the teachers Union Soviet , people women et people children are particularly vulnerable to bearer regard .

he exists now of people tests which amounts a 1986 that of people persons to risk .
we can reduce reduced the number of persons which développeront the osteoporosis if we take of people measures of prevention et of lives .
the Canada must do Evidence of exercise favour élaborant a framework hard of prevention , of diagnosed et of treatment of endorsed disease incapacitante .

transport work of the Senate
health statement of the Speaker Act the licensing of once leave to the dissimilar of people Affairs tax et Act the event of the 14 October 99
his Hon. the Speaker :
honourable senators , Mexico - you of agreed asset that I consistent now health statement that the Senator Lynch - Staunton me ago asked of do to the topic of people Affairs tax meetings of la last postponement ?
from people Senators :
from agreed .
his Hon. the Speaker :
the 14 October , during people Affairs tax , the Senator Hays ago asked health permission of introduce , to the reading of people notice of ways of the government , once motion accordingly standpoint of continue the adjournment of the Senate .
health permission him ago summer granted , but early that health question ago summer implementation favour arguments , he there ago strokes once 800 mind ownership to health procedure to follow .
singing health end , health motion would the adjournment of two weeks ago summer agreed et the Senate is 9.7 to another something .
nevertheless , when the order of the day ago summer types , the Senator Lynch - Staunton ago asked to the Speaker of Chief health question order of avoid whole mind to the future .
i thank lot the Senator Lynch - Staunton ' wheel raised health question , I believe that what is important .
thereafter to endorsed asking , I I well bringing to health question et I am now prepared to me deal Act my interpretation of the Application of people rules et the of the Senate .
Roberta my statement , I me am ' of Examine the more of case possible , but I not am not course of wheel been all people for .
accordingly addition , bearer review speaks Arabian of reported some flaws et incohérences contained the rule , based reasons the comit Standing of people privileges , of the rule et of la procedure should apply Lavoie .
health basic Current of people Affairs tax fact part of la procedure of the Senate since 1991 .
endorsed year - headed , the rule of the Senate ago summer amended asset question the order contained cetera people issues of people Affairs tax bound appelées to health thereafter of people statements of senators .
bearer order is established to the paragraph 23 ( 6 ) .
the section standing by elsewhere that people issues of privilege et people or to the rule are it to the reading of people Affairs tax et that everyone vote by Appeal . asked is . to 17 h 30 , except favour case of motion without debate eye without give .
from other provisions of the section provisions the hour to commentary apply hearings health period of people issues et the hour to commentary the order of the day arranged types if the time expected asset people Affairs tax is Teleglobe .
health period of people Affairs tax understand health Presented of reports of committees committees or special , people notice of ways of the government , thereby that people notice of ways introduced by of other senators .
usually , people chairs compound simply introduce their report et people senators market notice of la motion .
but to the opportunity , health permission is demandée of proceed Act - the - terrorism , or more later to the dissimilar of la Francophonie , to health arguments of the report of a Committee .
from same , to the reading of people notice of ways , the chairman of a Committee ask health permission of introduce once motion asset allow to his Committee of apply Camera to a payment where the Senate could perhaps favour postponement .
these recent years , all people Senate where the Senate seat , the Leader Deputy of the government asking almost , health permission of introduce once motion asset that the Senate apply while to 13 h 30 the Wednesday rather that to 14 hours .
each once that he is asked of déroger to health procedure of people Affairs tax , he apply notional of a notice favour Application of people sections 57 or 58 .
health permission is granted if nil Senator subsection contained health Room not apply there welcome .
if a odyssey apply there welcome , health question not may perhaps that before health end of the respond being .
accordingly addition , if health permission is granted , the Adopted of the report or of la motion is Proposed Act - the - terrorism , except if health asking move of favour Extend the review to more later to the dissimilar of la Francophonie .
when health question Current to the report or to health motion is implementation to people Senators , she is sujette to debate .
the fact that these issues legal a give Beauchesne plainly that firms are the to debate .
nil report of Committee or motion of investigate which is implemented to people Senators not is soustrait to health possibility of a debate .
the fact that people ways representations with la permission of the Senate to the reading of people Affairs tax not are rarely or never not not means not that firms not qualified not the perhaps .
thanks people ways representations without give not arresting perhaps not .
once once the debate favour dissimilar , all people rules provision people debates are savings , there including health possibility of a order to the rule .
confirms keeps to the fact that favour , that health question authorized implementation to people Senators , the Séant apply is of what fact out of people Affairs tax asset health length of the debate , until to what that he authorized tranché or adjourned .
singing my sense , health sites of the paragraph 23 ( 1 ) , when people or to the rule or people issues of privilege to the reading of people Affairs tax , not apply youth not to the debate , Chair given that the Senate not is set more to the reading of people Affairs tax .
if , by elsewhere , once asking of vote by Appeal . is eye to health end of the debate , the paragraph 23 ( 3 ) standing that he arranged . to 17 h 30 what day - headed , except , well heard , if health permission is granted of the hold to a another payment .
once another provision of the section 23 apply youth same if a debate is favour dissimilar .
the paragraph 23 ( 7 ) introduces that to the more later 30 minutes after the Appeal of the Prime standpoint of people Affairs tax , the Senate must mood to health period of people issues .
he is therefore possible that the review of people Affairs tax or a debate favour dissimilar Act a standpoint of people Affairs tax authorized interrompu by health period of people issues .
from fact , what is what which apply is produced the 6 May 1993 when the debate favour third reading of the bill of bill C - 114 , amend health Act election of the Canada , took summer asked immediately after health Presented of the report Act the bill of bill , without amendment , by the comit of people Affairs Legal et Constitutional .
singing endorsed opportunity , the bill of bill Partnerships place the reading of la third reading before health end of the respond of S minute asset people Affairs tax year health period of people issues .
the Senate is then 9.7 to the review of the order of the day without revert to people Affairs tax .
hence therefore favour big what which may apply mood when the Senate accept of foreign once motion to the reading of people Affairs tax .
i hope that these Particulars you allow of better understand bearer aspect of our proceedings .
what which apply is 9.7 the Thursday 14 October last , when the Senator Hays ago asked health permission of introduce once motion designed to continue the adjournment of the Senate , guardian therefore act to our rules et the .

Roberta the speech of the another , the government announcement that he tell to people young Canadians of using their energy et strip talents addition - sea favour activities to of people programs international of from et favour by people country favour route of development to apply the Act Internet .
these experiences arresting perhaps of once vast value , as health training paying et direct that firms carriers ; provincial knowledge learning contained of other country et representations of other Peoples ; health taken of conscience that the world is orator but that health felt not must not we prevent of contribute together .
what are headed of people lessons important which be our young , people leaders of tomorrow , states to do as our communities et our country contained the economy century .

we must to these by which resulted imaginé what country et the resulted chosen of do a he asset the century which springs .
transport new by are well portants et living contained health region of the Atlantic or everywhere elsewhere to the Canada .
these new by , which alone the he of the economy century , not . not people prophètes of malheurs .
honourable senators , our Gouverneure general ago speech a speech ago to endorsed chamber when she ago responsibility dapper new function .
she ago said rejecting :
we not must not we see as a peoples which the to people trends , but as a peoples which people challenges .
we not must not we see as a peoples which the , but as a peoples which notional .
the government ago Syd his intent of see what country proud et the driver the world contained the next millennium et task - deserved .
we should all perhaps this of perhaps favour extent , Ambassador activist that parliamentarians , of do favour hallmark that confirms apply Pierre .
from people Senators :
hear !
the hon. John Lynch - Staunton ( cc of the Opposition ) :
honourable senators , I wish to congratulate health Gouverneure general recently appointed et to him hoped everyone the success whom contained coloured new duties of representative of the Opposition of the state Heritage .
Mrs. Clarkson here to the a of our Veterans colleagues which ago significant once visit personal to once absent ingrate et often little appréciée to dapper fair value .
PuissentM. Roméo LeBlanc et dapper gracieuse wife , Diana , and once attest retirement pleased Act people , of the the of Northumberland .
health political may perhaps also particular that grisante , et not only after of people election .
transport reports between people different for , often dénaturés by people ambitions personal , we cancer often rudement to the test .
the success of a party political , et much of his Opposition , banned that viability people déconvenues or people problems gain , is the the of la loyalty of people supporters .
honourable senators , these observations me located to the mind to health thereafter of the withdrawal have of the Senator Graham of coloured duties of Leader of the government to the Senate .
during his mandate , the commitment of the Senator to the regard of our institution et of la Scotia - Scotia not ago never fact alone each once that he apply is acted asset him of defend people objectives of the government et of his party .
coloured qualities of man of honour et of principles not resulted never tree been implemented to the test that the months last , et dapper conduct around since favour secondary once new once health Evidence .
that he me authorized Arabian of use health thinking of Edmund the asset express my reaction to the limogeage if whose of the Senator Graham .
health magnanimité favour political is often the uniqueness seaway of la wisdom et health farmers of a party political is by by people spirit the .
rejecting said , to the behalf of people members of our caucuses et of finer - even , I wish right fortunate to the Senator Boudreau to the station of Leader of the government .
however , his person that he is here primarily asset redorer the blason of his party favour Scotia - Scotia , what that he ago fact of manner extraordinary contained the speech that he ago speech he there ago few the , is troublante because she interest of people issues Act the pleasant contained endorsed chamber non house favour left once absent Public élective .
the Senator Boudreau ago said without ambages that he Partnerships the intent of perhaps candidate to health chamber des people Commons to people next election .
what is to my notice as if a that of la League national of hockey , the apply do Refer contained once ligue mineure .
i hope that the Senator Boudreau apprendra move to together the importance et people accomplishments of the Senate et that he apply letter account that what is contained endorsed chamber that people bills of bill are the better them , where the mind of party not is never too speech et where people supporters of the government , people ministers et people senators of Aboriginal plan are all treaties as of people individuals et non as of people automates , et that they apply form favour consequential , free of people do cut to our colleagues contained the another place .
transport senators of et Furey , which resulted proposed et supported health motion Current to the Adresse favour response to the speech of the another , run are acquittés with vast distinction et eloquence of their role .
he not 50 however not consider contained strip comments another something that once domestic reference to the speech which ago dangerous pesé to His Excellency et which attend a approach becoming with 22 that she ago speech after his assermentation .
the Senator of favour ago fact little of case , not him their that few for 2 , et we ago given once have of his commitment deep loyalty his country et the government , what that ago fact also the Senator Furey .
accordingly fact , they not sons not the choice Before a speech whose lights him activist et which is immediately become a non - distance .
what which avoided owed perhaps once vision asset the century to come apply is lives favour once litanie of and .
the Stratton of anticipation 1997 Act the standing everyone of proposals concrete asset deal people serious problems that we some currently .
gold , to health vast knew of all , the speech of the another ago 9.7 Subcommittee silence the agriculture of the Western , which you health worse crisis since people years 30 , people fisheries , which are favour legislation to of Montr difficulties , the immigration illégale , which trahit people failles of la introduce Canadian , people difficulties of people companies air that , even today today , the government rather that someone something types people " forces of the market " wearing , et health reduction of people taxes which , if lights déchiffre people few words which there are spent , arranged do fair before people next election .
health poverty et the fate of people without - Relief not resulted situation been mentioned .
however , he there ago two subjects which resulted been the contained the speech of the another et whose I query speak .
the Prime motivator la statement according commentary the government not tell more never that the lights perde the control of people Finance of the state .
he is rassurant of see that those - headed same which were headed to the era et which resulted attempt guide people Finance of la Nation go to health the resulted nothing by understand , even if enough not ago not been easy .
i think favour particular to the Prime Minister which , Ambassador activist that chairman of the Council of the Treasury et Minister of people Finance contained people years positions , took lot contributed to the global of the deficit budget , which ago sextuplé , et of la debt Public strong , which ago doubled .
what that the government not recognizes not , but whose everyone the world apply Chalifoux of more favour more account , what is that people good results francophone to people professional budget et Monetary are 10 to the fact that the lights ago continued of apply people political various by people governments Mulroney , tourism people Liberals were who to the era , to whether health reduction of people Estimates of programs pursuant to people needs declaration real , health creation of a surplus of functioning , health reduction of people rate of interest et once reduction of the rate of inflation .
these results , which not lend never revival perhaps require Subcommittee people Veterans Liberals , et the free - Exchange - dimensional apply national learned these same Members dépensiers - are now to health basic of people political current of the government , a government which tait effrontément people efforts most tell by people governments Mulroney , which is was by health great Opposition that he ago political against these measures when firms resulted been the , consumer health Excise Act people products et services .
accordingly September 1990 , the Opposition of the Party Liberal Partnerships said that :
... health Position of the party is clear .
we we opposons to health GST et not want not of dapper implementation favour implementation .
recently , the Prime Minister ago fact the hard of endorsed Excise et out whole Robertson of the eliminate , et what same Act the equipment of reading , thereby that favour ago regulatory a vote held here favour September .
the second standpoint which attention my attention contained the speech is more disturbing because he door Act the future of our country .
the government of the Canada ' therefore the commitment that he ago retired loyalty people Quebecers et all people other Canadians , to whether that the principle of the set by health Court Supreme of the Canada arranged therefore .
further to certain hear less nuancés of certain door - speaking of the government , rejecting suggests hear that favour case of a referendum , the government Liberal ago the intent of out to dapper manner the view of la Court Supreme Act la question of a vote house to health sovereignty !
i saying view because what not is not once decision , but well once view that health Court Supreme ago decision .
nothing contained endorsed view not is which that what authorized .
ownership to finer , health court is care too far favour dépassant people three issues that she guardian called to by et , what bad , she amendments to a debate political which not is not of his responsible .
why ?
Undeterred I believe that health Court Supreme is care too far contained coloured set , individually I am three that the government federal apply fine prepared to participate to a referendum , non only before that he not apply moved , but same before that he not authorized known !
health priority primordiale of everyone government National is the unity of the country , et never he not should question a court which the to the dealing of similar - side .
accordingly interprétant to dapper manner once series of conditions waves et one of la Court Supreme , the government risk favour greenhouse of apply find partner contained once adventure which could , paid to all people Canadians .
i like conclude favour continuing of once great concern very by lot , what is - to - say the fact that the Parliament , et mostly health chamber des people Commons , is of more favour more déphasé .
i not I never hid my admiration asset health form of government of people States - States , because their regime based Act a system of system which knew people followed refers the a of people powers may apply thoughts odyssey .
the more often , the chairman et the Congress are allows to health research of compromise , because all people two are people major the of the developing et of the Adopted clear of people laws .
transport mistakes of the executive et people camouflages not just not inaperçus well long , because , to the lower the , the Congress fact inquiry .
he sometimes often , he is true , that the power legislative which exagérément the advantage that he refers asset Teleglobe long once appointment présidentielle or someone another initiative of the executive , but confirms not during nothing to the fact that people two powers are more or less Act a foot of equality et arresting rarely success the a without the another .
health chamber not sitting that since few days when the government ago low health light asset implement end to the debate Act the bill of bill C - 6 .
he ago direct of favour do tree asset the bill of bill Act the agreed the nisga' ago .
why ?
simply because these bills of bill , we said - lights , acclaimed been said elsewhere , et that once study more the to people Commons not elected nothing of nine .
perhaps - lights express more plainly his contemptuous asset health democracy Parliamentary ?
unfortunately , the Senate ago summer treaty to little closely of la same manner when he ago summer reminded asset debate the bill of bill C - 32 , based the environment , et the bill of bill C - called , based people Pension .
sitôt favour station , the new Minister of the continues ago announced that the bill of bill C - 32 Partnerships been enough otherwise chamber et that nil amendment not citing accepted .
singing the comit , health majority ago low health light , assure a report unanimous ago summer line to the Senate break that the bill of bill guardian entaché of dangerous of policy that once review should three immediately after his Adopted .
health light ago summer forced to health third reading , people senators served the that , even if the bill of bill Partnerships of many obtain , he many higher to health bill existante .
accordingly standing the bill of bill C - 32 , health majority to the Senate ago favour fact consciemment supported a bill of bill everyone favour knowing that he avoided owed do the subject of a review more review , according the role the of the Senate .
what not is not headed the once of coloured best accomplishments .
the bill of bill Act people Pension ago summer the of the months of June to the months of September asset give to the Council of the Treasury et to the Alliance of la Fonction Public health fortunate of apply meet to the dissimilar of the been asset trying of involved certain , , everything particularly favour what which touchait people impotent the .
the Council of the Treasury ago refused of meet the says asset discuss of la question , alléguant that these impotent the to the government .
health new Clarkson of the Council of the Treasury apply is montrée also inflexible .
lights not ago therefore held nil account of the judgment unanimous of the Senate .
singing the dissimilar of the debate of third reading , lights us ago fact whether that if the says wanted do current coloured claims relatively to the sharing of the surplus , he should the once include favour justice .
heretofore still , the Senate ago message coloured responsibilities during to the chapter of the review special order of meet once secondary voice of the outside supporting that the bill of bill authorized passed despite coloured other .
i I underlined more earlier that the new Leader of the government to the Senate Partnerships been number of la amount of work that we people here by report to what which apply fact to the another place .
i am of notice that what which apply is produced favour September is owed more to the look which . once was that to a own during favour standpoint of reduce people Voluntary of the Senate to the process Parliamentary et I am sure that to the dissimilar of endorsed new sessional , we reprendrons our responsibilities during , everything favour Chair always well to the fact of people désirs of la chamber house .
i believe well also that people military their supporting that lights withdrew to the Opposition all people the of Committee that she occupies except once t are not allegations .
no regardless breaching observer independent not declaration that recognize that people the of Committee a by of people colleagues of my party to the dissimilar of la first sessional of la presented th resulted been certain with distinction et to the honour of the Senate .
obviously Robertson of reduce without concern health contribution of non - supporters of the government to the system of people committees apply heurtera to once serious long , non not by the , but because that health vast value of our institution based Act a touchstone of cooperation et non of , the .
singing the era where we convinced the of the side of the Opposition , we we the several once - well that with difficulty , I the concerns - to the envy of do of the shocking asset the changes of do of the shocking , what which ago summer the case during once right part of people years 80 et favour 1990 when people / were the .
we we worked attempt to the dismissal of two bills of bill , regarding the airport Pearson et regarding the the of la to election , because they were plainly anticonstitutionnels .
we the always to the mind that health strongly of people representatives elected must perhaps whose , to that she apply the contained people limits of la Constitution .
honourable senators , the success of the Senate apply extent non not by the exploitation of once majority asset do adopt of people bills of bill to health steamship , but rather by health contribution of all people senators to the improvement of people measures legislatures which we parviennent of the another place .
no grant to the Opposition that a role for contained what process , what citing Use the Senate favour once regions raising of la chamber des people Commons et give still more of have to those which levels to do abolished our institution .
once ceremony attitude could investigations destroy the mind Present of cooperation et of regard which , he is that of the see , not is not abroad to the Alternative of the Opposition asset the Senate , a Alternative that health majority , I the hope , continue of share .
( Act la motion of the Senator Hays , the debate is adjourned . )

the bill of bill S - 29 is death to the Paper meetings of la was of the Parliament favour September .
singing my notice , the bill of bill S - 2 , Act serious health taken of some decisions medical , intègre the better of people bills of bill S - 13 et S - 29 .
however , I wish that he authorized well clear asset all people senators that I not small not what bill of bill as the was .

transport honourable senators new that the bill of bill S - 2 making by a one .
the 23 February 1994 , the comit Standing special Act the care et the assistance to the suicide ago summer set asset Examine people aspects legal , Housing et Ethics of the care et of the assistance to the suicide .
they resulted fourth to people care palliative et to the refusal of receive a treatment purposes to maintain people duties the or to the v. of what type of treatment .
they resulted fourth to health Yukon of la sense .
the 6 June 1995 , the comit ago submitted to the Senate his rapport entitled : " Ban health life et of la death " .
according finer , the one of what bill of bill is importance asset give to the Senate the deserves which him talk of full right .
certain editors of laws not . not people préambules .
however , contained the case subsection , he not is not only change , but he Chalifoux justice to the comit , which ago worked very durum .
i query now speak of points funding of the bill of bill S - 2 .
the section 2 of the bill of bill introduces that nil provider of care of health not may perhaps recognized found of once offence favour under of the Code criminal asset wheel CRTC to once human of people Veterinary with the intent of that or of do replacement dapper that physical , to of people same base abréger dapper life .
Roberta his rapport entitled : " Ban health life et of la death " , the comit Standing special recognizes that health practice which challenge to deal the men ' manner to that coloured suffering , even if she may abréger health life of the men , is currently into .
the Code criminal not attend not people care palliative , even if confirms may abréger health life of the men , Ambassador tree that people care are state of manner act to people practices medical generally laws .
however , a number number of witnesses resulted Syd to the comit that people doctors hésitaient often to fund enough of Veterinary antidouleur if confirms the of abréger health life of people patients , of turn of perhaps held criminellement responsible of the Late of strip patients .
from very many witnesses him rose described health mind which China activist home people professionals of la health that to the breast of la population favour General ownership to health the of la practice , the comit Standing special ago recommended to the unanimously that people provisions asking of the Code criminal viability , .
many are people doctors apply spécialisant contained people care palliative which regulation that the treatment of la sense not abrège never health life of the men .
according certain evidence tax , when health concentration of people Veterinary is well courts , people patients apply adaptent simply to health long ill of people Veterinary facilities .
however , we not favour we no Evidence et , to my notice , headed not is not health found issue .
all tree that we impotent , we should ensure to what that people patients to the Canada suffering the less possible .
the comit Standing not is not the odyssey to possibility that lights clarifie people provisions of the Code criminal which together Act la possibility of fund a treatment which , everything favour atténuant health sense , risk of abréger health life of the men .
health Wheat of reform of the right Partnerships five health same recommendation contained a report that she ago report favour 1983 .
from more , the Association medical Canadian the health in of la bill contained what field since 1992 .
the comit Standing special of the Propriety more general of " treatment purposes to that health that " , but the section 2 of the bill of bill is five of manner to mean people situations where of people Veterinary are facilities asset that of people suffering émotionnelles or citizens .
singing my notice , he tangibly user of taken et nothing contained what bill of bill not should significant health controversy , et yet we know all that the treatment of la that émotionnelle or involved prepared to health controversy .
the section 2 not court not people the contained people case where he could there wheel a another type of responsibility justice , as health neglect thing .
honourable senators , and - finer well : the section 2 not apply youth participate not to people case where he there ago intent of civil health death .
he not apply youth that contained people case where the lights means that people suffering verbal of the men .
he is very important of the negative .
none not should times to dapper responsibility thing if his intent is of child someone a .
the paragraph 3 ( 1 ) of the bill of bill S - 2 introduces that the soignant not is not found of once offence portion by the Code criminal of the odyssey fact that to health asking of once human Party , he apply abstient of him fund a treatment of survival or favour , the directors .
the paragraph 3 ( 2 ) clarifie people circumstances contained reasons once asking is act floor to people purposes of the paragraph 3 ( 1 ) .
from people Energy there studies , especially to people laws of once province , celebrating always us .
health most of people provinces resulted already passed of people provisions legislatures Act people Energy studies .
the Alberta is health last province to wheel passed once bill to what topic ; favour greenhouse , health Personal the giving ago summer the et is coming favour effect the 1 December 1997 .
the Manitoba , Newfoundland - Newfoundland , health Scotia - Scotia , the Ontario et the Quebec resulted also légalisé health drafting of what that the lights reserves , contained the in , people testaments biological .
health Columbia - Columbia et to the Island - Prince - Prince Edward Prince resulted passed of people laws favour endorsed 1910 , but Right - side not are not still favour effect .
singing alone of Energy there data préalablement pursuant to people laws of once province , of people clear there non Official or once asking eye that or by it , Ambassador presence of to the less a witness , constitute once asking floor .
the paragraph 3 ( 3 ) introduces that once another asking may perhaps eye by a agent , a representative Senate or a spouse , but only if the men not ago not health ability of the do or if , during that he favour guardian Party , he not ago not fact of asking floor .
Roberta his rapport entitled : " Ban health life et of la death " , the comit Standing special ago person the such of treatment of survival as Chair the fact of t not good a treatment global of maintain the men favour life , by example not not trying health the cardiorespiratoire ( RCR ) , not not give once us . , not not fund of antibiotics or not not ensure the food et the hydratation artificielles .
he ago person the required as the fact of mean a treatment global of maintain the men favour life , by example débrancher the respirateur .
the comit Standing special ago underlined that people courts Travellers resulted recognized to people patients the right favour the the of agree a treatment medical or of hold that a treatment , once once began , authorized interrompu .
Roberta of people Affairs as Malettec. Schulman , Ambassador 1990 , Nancy B . Q Hôtel - God of Quebec , Ambassador 1992 et contained the affair Rodriguez , Ambassador 1993 , people courts resulted says recognized what right , even if health consequential of endorsed such or of endorsed required of treatment of survival is health death .
i think that he is important of revert Act some of these causes with you .
Roberta the affair Mallettec. Schulman , Ambassador 1990 , health Court of Appeal of the Ontario ago Syd that people Energy Act people meeting issue data during that once the favour guardian Party eligible perhaps quite , even if she not Partnerships not health ability of take once decision .
health court ago launch that the doctor predicted meet people Energy there of a witness of Jéhovah which refuses whole us . , even contained once situation of emergency where health the not finest give his consent .
singing people words of la decision that she ago decision favour January 1992 contained the affair Nancy B . , health Court Superior of the Quebec ago launch that health the day Party , enjoyed of once disease incurable et alitée until to health end of coloured days , Partnerships the right of ask that his doctor débranche the respirateur which health maintenait favour life .
accordingly anyone dapper decision , the Justice Dufour ago quoted people sections of the Code Civil of the Quebec according compete health human tragedy is inviolable et proposed not may perhaps forced of look a treatment without his consent .
endorsed affair that also of la responsibility thing of the doctor which predicted , to health asking of Nancy B . , débrancher the respirateur .
after apply perhaps . to people sections 216 , 217 , 45,000 et 219 of the Code criminal , thereby that to people provisions Act the the the , the Justice ago signed that a doctor not Command not Evidence of once conduct the , gratuite or the favour débranchant the respirateur of once the to health asking of similar - side et favour interesting health disease of la the follow his dissimilar continue .
accordingly 1993 , Mr. the Justice Sopinka , of la Court Supreme of the Canada , which ago prepared health decision The contained the affair Rodriguez , took also recognized the right of people patients of t not 1986 to a treatment or of ask that the treatment authorized interrompu , even if health death predicted favour and .
he is important of apply remind that , contained what case , health majority not guardian not favour favour of the care et of the assistance to the suicide .
she guardian however favour favour of the right to the such or to the required of the treatment , right which is the subject of the bill of bill to the study .
however , honourable senators , of people witnesses resulted said Before the comit special that , contained certain case , lights not Partnerships not therefore the chamber of people patients because that the Code criminal not guardian not clear et that people the the of perhaps held responsible .
singing untold of these evidence Act la mind which exists Incidence people the et health population favour General , the comit Standing special ago recommended to new to the unanimously that health the the favour effect authorized codifiée of manner to Chief people circumstances contained reasons he is legal acceptable of t not provide or of interrupt a treatment of survival .

health strategy of the housing VI to determine if people recent decisions of the government federal allow of improve people conditions of housing of people families aboriginal et if of important improvements arresting perhaps Location to health strategy federal Current .
what document of work is purposes to facilitate a real dialogue Act people prices good of once strategy which we Kelleher remedy contained the next century et Act la wish manner of la implement favour implementation .
we we chosen of we go Act people forces of all people Peoples to the Canada Reorganizationand people sources of these forces asset favour happen to once strategy the .
once source of strength sometimes , et implementation of side is health strongly et the right of people Peoples aboriginal - provincial M , people war et people members of people First First - of and et of implement favour implementation strip own solutions .
what is endorsed strength which ago typical the launch with success of hundreds of initiatives arguments of la basic .
sometimes , firms resulted been gênées by of people tracasseries force or not resulted revival discussions asset once reason whatever .
from other initiatives arguments of people aboriginal themselves - executory resulted executive health made of people networks regional et then declaration , thereby that of people institutions important Act compete we comptons now .
if we can better combiner people points strong of people aboriginal et of people Canadians favour General et whom these forces asset improve the housing , we close fact lot more that anyone finest apply there wait .
i try now me consider Act la scope et the subject of la strategy favour 1910 of housing asset people families aboriginal .
certain arresting think that we not we not need of once another study Act people conditions of housing or once study Act people ways of modify people programs declaration contained the hope that people families aboriginal qualified favour learn certain benefits .
we impotent of agreed .
too of these studies resulted already been Conducted et resulted led to once low improvement of people conditions of life .
from more , we we all revival benefit of people advice et of la research without precedent of la Wheat Royal Act people Peoples aboriginal , Ambassador 1996 .
we now now people creation accomplishments of the initiative " the our forces " , the plan of Action that the government federal ago lengthy favour January 1997 .
we recall up that of other partners contained health Confederation annonceraient themselves also strip professional et strip priorities .
singing what chapter , we impotent the .
certain progress are the , but several senators et leaders aboriginal apply concern of more favour more of the lack of measures concrete taken asset improve people conditions of housing of people families aboriginal .
we want the a dialogue National Act la need of establish once strategy clear et more dynamic favour 1910 of housing asset people families aboriginal .
we want we go Act the accept ensure of once strategy asset people families experience to the outside of people reservations et of people Lands implemented of side asset people Peoples aboriginal contained the framework of agreements Act people claims land , .
transport families aboriginal experience Act these Lands resulted , to people words of treaties et of la bill , of people conditions of housing which diffèrent lot of Right of people families experience elsewhere .
whereupon that he favour authorized , obviously strategy favour 1910 of housing must hold account of people mouvements of population Act these Lands .
lot of M , of war et of members of people First First submariners vigorous people communaut ancestrales asset consider of the work , of people opportunities prometteuses et of people housing , contained people main et small cities of the Canada .
what is once trend value which paving apply pursue .
lights knows well also that their rate of natalité is higher to health average national , everything as the number of strip young is more high , since health population aboriginal is 10 years more ardent that health population favour General .
he there ago 50 years , lights dénombrait less of 200 40,000 aboriginal .
today today , he there favour ago more of 1 created which living to the Canada .
what figure not understand not however health population of people M of the country .
lot of other aboriginal living to people States - States et arresting or non revert to the country after strip years of work .
lights introduces that health population aboriginal paving increasing the 40,000 persons to the dissimilar of la next generation .
coloured conditions payroll et economic not the that of modest improvements .
once strategy favour 1910 of housing reasonable must power respond to people needs future confidence of la population aboriginal et to people new priorities .
i try now explain why people conditions et people problems of housing of people aboriginal are different .
once reason important asset commentary more of la half of people families aboriginal living today today contained of people housing research to people standards is once vast poverty persistante .
lot are often Act the standpoint of apply patients contained health street or submariners living contained of people communaut rural , to et CEGEPS already surpeuplées .
transport jobs that people aboriginal friends are evil which et they must using to the reduced their involved of paye asset respond to people needs basic favour food et favour Clothing of families more many that health average .
lights estimated that the income of employment of people aboriginal 4 to the two 33 of 22 of la average national .
more of 40 % of between themselves not sons not of income of employment favour 1995 .
they resulted little or not of credit .
that arriverait - he if people aboriginal eligible obtain health is with people Canadians methods favour 1910 of employment et of salary ?
obviously , confirms their including a level of life higher et everyone the Canada favour profiterait .
accordingly 1991 , the former Minister of people Foreign Indian et of the North Heritage , Thomas Siddon , Marsden that , run he there Partnerships is of here the year 2000 , the produced National gross of the Canada agency of increase people incomes taxation of the government federal of 4,3 billion of dollars et of reduce health debt national of 20 billion of dollars .
health commission Royal there is care of dapper milled analysis Act what standpoint .
she ago gentleman that he favour would to the Canada 7,5 billion of dollars us activist that people circumstances economic et payroll of people Peoples aboriginal demeureraient deal to health average national .
he regardless of note that what amount 4 to once loss of income costs of 2,9 billion of dollars asset people Peoples aboriginal , combinée to a cost tax of 4,6 billion of dollars , there including 2,1 billion of dollars Subcommittee form of lack to assist asset the government .
unfortunately , once strategy designed to respond to people needs favour 1910 of housing show aware with a problem of poverty aiguë home people aboriginal , because that nothing not Beauchesne that people disparités economic et payroll between health population favour General et people aboriginal submariners soon replacement .
health Recent net of people rate of literacy et of people levels of education favour General help some families , but people housing most its inabordables asset a well too orator number of aboriginal .
transport the economic resulted been down lot too slowly to the dissimilar of people 20 recent years asset allowing grounds that the lights apply is positions of the problem of la poverty home people aboriginal .
some are more she that of other .
decisions together , these reasons resulted alone lot of difficulties .
if we want we seat of once strategy favour 1910 of housing which based Act of people bases base , he citing course of Examine some of these reasons .
health discrimination Subcommittee all coloured forms remains the once of people causes which the health better situation of the housing home people aboriginal .
she report to endorsed era the the of Corporation made of Standing et of housing .
nearly of 30 years more later , the program of housing plan to the intent of people aboriginal ago seen the day .
the Program of housing of people aboriginal favour considerable urbain ago follow favour 1978 .
transport new commitments favour 1910 of housing contained the framework of these programs resulted taken end favour same time that the government federal ago truly of take of people commitments favour 1910 of housing Housing the 1 January 1994 . Pendant whole dapper length , the program of housing of people aboriginal not ago never fact the subject of once assessment .
transport disparités quality also to health low priority granted to people issues of housing of people aboriginal .
endorsed situation could consumer apply explain by the lack of representation aboriginal to the Parliament of the Canada Reorganizationand of involvement of people aboriginal to health function Public federal .
transport arcanes of the power committees little of aboriginal asset attention the attention Act people problems raised or Act strip solutions .
confirms due lot more investigations of forget people conditions contained reasons firms the .
fair to the payment where people Canadians , to perhaps more know of people needs of people aboriginal , people priorities national resulted changed .
endorsed situation with fact that people conditions of life own of people Canadians éclipsent health reality of people aboriginal .
honourable senators , the idea according commentary people problems aboriginal et people solutions to there contribute not future that once version namely of people problems provided et of people solutions to contribute to the environment of the Canada is once another reason which let people also results et accomplishments to the breast of people corporations aboriginal .
nothing not door to grounds that once recently strategy retain given of good results to the incorrigible of people years .
accordingly reality , what is a model not rose more of credibility , et of important studies of people conditions payroll et economic , there including the study of December 1998 Act la clochardise , the the Adopted of on was asset hold account of people into reflect compound opposite people aboriginal .
well that of people services to people aboriginal viability came apply add to people programs of management of the housing , people political et programs of basic are those which are used asset deal people problems non aboriginal , et people governments federal et provincial favour are people fiscal .
transport problems of jurisdiction debates to the housing of people aboriginal standard elsewhere that Act people Lands réservées to these immediately we past even .
health most of people authorities provincial , land et aboriginal apply favour increase essentially to the government federal .
yet , people transfers of fund , people points of Proposed , people powers et the directors general more of responsibilities to people provinces .
what transfer of skills C health controversy et freine health towards of what file .

since that he ago summer implemented end to health construction of new housing , favour 1994 , health list of people aboriginal favour standing of a housing apply is allongée .
he is obviously that the her of housing Cultural Present not may foreign people families aboriginal or not people accept not .
these recent years , people provinces resulted reduced strip commitments or there resulted implemented end et he not exists not of figure available Act the number of families aboriginal logées contained of people housing Cultural .
he regardless of do noted that people housing Cultural are the Act la basic of la might of la solvabilité et of the increase of the income , what which attend the access of people aboriginal to of people housing , regarding to people non - native .

Roberta a section of newspaper , lights said that after a held of nine days , the chairman Clinton ago signed a agreed Farm which introduces once assistance of emergency to people farmers of 8,7 billion of dollars .
accordingly response to confirms , the chairman of the comit of the agriculture ago Syd :

lights investment of la crisis Farm since of people months .
during what time , people farmers resulted been acculés to the foot of the this because that strip marges of Moncton apply are resserrées .
transport costs échappent to the control of people farmers .
transport price are products by people markets international et they échappent also to their control .
health competition is impossible to untold of people grants same by the Union European et people States - States .
even if people farmers arresting rely Act the income of a or two jobs to the outside of la strong , they are help debt et wisdom health bankruptcy .
they palatable meaning their earth , their heritage , their source of income et the start of life refers they are deep the .
honourable senators , people tragedies personal not compound not always the subject of ensure national , but I try simply few reasons which the why health crisis is say to the standpoint of justify a debate of emergency .
from thanking , health week last , of people producers agricultural et people premiers ministers of the Manitoba et of la Saskatchewan are came to Ottawa asset ask the assistance of the government federal .

second , the Program of assistance favour case of catastrophe related to the income Farm , which predicted gap once see contained people programs provided of security of the income Farm , is a disaster .
singing the Manitoba , more of 55p. % of people farmers whose health asking ago summer addressed until to subsection not resulted received no assistance .
estimates , the effect of la crisis Farm is found non only by people , agricultural family , but also by almost everyone the world favour considerable plan .
transport people not arresting pay strip meeting .

he we resulted been very both of people wheel hour here , to the Senate .
they are get , et , by of people forces which échappent complete to their control .

without too , people things , he not there ago not of doubt contained my mind that I I been West as favour mistake .
i I chosen of add faith to confirms because that three or four persons different were favour emerging of respond to health asking of information .
confirms motivator the 1 regiment of campaign of the Artillerie Royal Canadian , whose the Headquarters General apply wherever to Halifax .
what is once unity that the Minister Sole strong well et whose he is without doubt enough proud favour activist that all - all .
lights ago recognized to endorsed unity a level of cut favour Business of 93,1p. % et a rate of programs of 88,5p. % .
lights account to the less 15 units of contingency to the Canada which are qualifiées of non ; .
however , no of between firms not ago one file recently .
confirms ago little whole once brouille between the apparatus of la contingency to the Canada Reorganizationand the government Present , displaced of people reasons as Right - side , I thought .

i think that health human whole the asset do these Murray is proposed another that the Minister responsible of la Scotia - Scotia .
i not asking not of people negotiations the to bearer regard , but of little Murray asset the mistake , somewhat regardless how she ago summer commise .
the Minister may - he ask once reassessment of la where granted to endorsed unity historic of la Scotia - Scotia to the dissimilar of the process of reassessment ?

why the government speaks - he if long before of favour do tree ?
from people thousands of Canadians living contained people land , Subcommittee people our , contained people on .
what are people citizens mining of our society .
the problem of people without - Relief is a problem real et serious refers too of Canadians are witness today today ; what is a problem whose I your that the government forward otherwise contained the speech of the another .
mother Teresa we ago implemented favour custody when she ago said :

now that the budget is excédentaire , I hope that the government favour take asset apply address seriously to the problem the et get of la poverty to the Canada before that up asset him the hour of the judgment last .
health vision of contained the speech of the another ago difference the accept that the government stand take contained the year which springs .
i brevity the government of wheel strokes health prévoyance of recognize that a investment contained people creation years of our children is a investment contained the future of our country .
however , displaced rompre the i of la poverty , he tangibly give to all people children to the Canada once fortunate equated of supports everyone their potential .
he is better of see that they not favour resulted not health possibility today today .
if we could strategy with success to people conditions payroll which perpétuent health poverty family , honourable senators , we could higher once new generation of children - of people children whose people needs essential are comblés asset that they qualified become of people members of la society Canadian favour right health , allow et the .
the Prime Minister ago said :
we must mood also quickly that possible of people words to people mood .

honourable senators , ten years resulted 9.7 et he is yet . of see that the government ago fact well little asset their people smaller Canadians , whose a Act five ago the the taken .
singing extent that health poverty apply répand to the Canada , endorsed promise favour the surprised of the government suggests less of hope .
the government ago promised of new investment contained health Prestation national asset children , but since he there ago one billion today today , why never - he to tomorrow asset take of people measures ?
when he ago pleasant people poor everywhere to the Canada , the group of work Act la poverty of the caucuses National of the Party Progressive - Conservative ago often et plainly heard say that the time is ratify asset the government federal of réindexer health Prestation national asset children to the rate of inflation .
singing the dissimilar of la last sessional , the MP Progressive - Conservative of Shefford , to the Quebec , took presented once motion of the same type to the another place .
the government Liberal ago terminal that he entendait leaders a 1.1 of dollars asset region the medical of the et the bringing of six months to a year .
i me welcome of endorsed initiative et of la prévoyance that ago the government favour recognition that he is important that people parents just of the time with strip children during people creation years of training .
however , when lights there does to two once , lights apply asking which to the fair economy of endorsed regarding .

from more , endorsed extent not fact nothing asset assist those which are society of the market of the work if .
she not answer not to people needs of people women to low income which not able not benefit of a medical of the if their spouse not 1,000 not of money .
that favour is - he of the Opposition of once family monoparentale which not may rely that Act him - even or she - even ?
i believe power say that what not is not health question of the medical of the which concern people unemployed Travellers , but well similar which challenge to find people methods of implement of the hundreds Act la table .
transport UN overseeing resulted Syd that the Canada guardian the better country to the world asset living .
yet , whom million of Canadians living Subcommittee the increase of la poverty .
the 12 October last , people Canadians sons need that lights their revealing a plan body of people solutions concrete order of eliminate health poverty , the number of people without - Relief et health need of wheel of people Banking of foods .
unfortunately , they resulted heard of waves gone which bound and contained a respond approximatif .

shame nothing not allows of grounds that people immediately acadiennes remettaient favour issue the regime British .
accordingly system that certain Acadians equipped places of people certain political , he not account no bill British or another During health the of strip women et of strip children .
nothing , if what not is a order of the Parliament , not finest users a topic British of his country , even apply he apply mark of a criminal .
the treaty of Utrecht of 1713 , et the who of la members Anne du23 June 1713 , acclaimed continuing health protection of by the treaty .
they stipulent that people Acadians resulted of people rights Act strip Lands et that they not arresting perhaps the to less of once sentence decision by a court .
that a member of the executive , which guardian a simple Lieutenant - governor , untouched répudié once needs Royal contrevenait to the right British basic of the era .
accordingly 1729 , the governor Richard Phillips Partnerships responsibility people Acadians by written of dapper protection against costs Kyoto .
the Colonel known ago acted without receive of orders et ago méprisé all people laws which politics people Acadians .
even the ever not Partnerships not the power of sign a order of déportation , because people provisions of 1297 of la Britain Charter of England stipulent that the ever not is not task - dealt of la bill , therefore still less a simple Lieutenant - governor Acting .
what . ago fact confisquer people property of people Acadians , brûler strip only et strip them , abattre strip are .
he ago system of people families that he ago . Act of people ships fragiles asset perhaps the as esclaves or condamnées to health servitude contained people over American .
Japanese that endorsed déportation thing et these camps of concentration were entamés when the treaty of 1760 ago summer signed et Teleglobe until favour 1763 .
transport ? judges we speak that they présument that known ago acted honorablement favour these what treaty of 1760 .
hence people China of a bureaucrate editor whose the duty event guardian of protect people Acadians .
from people China which special that he not Partnerships nil Alternative nor asset people treaties nor asset health the British .
from people decisions as Right - headed resulted always been , , that what authorized favour time of peace or of War .
Mrs. ago jurist of people minister the et , , even to the aune of people the of the the century .
from people minister as those - headed were inadmissibles contained the 9.7 et they the are everyone tree today today .
a criminal not should not wheel the right of create of people laws basic contained once society civilisée .
his court reprehensible the ago private of everyone right Senate et moral of sign not regardless breaching document refers lights apply réfère today today asset such our civilization modern .
accordingly Health our laws Act once reference to known , lights apply moque of la memory of our most Canadians et mandate , of our martyrs which resulted raising et paid their blood asset that some people against murderers of people as known .
they resulted paid their blood asset that of people tyrans of endorsed Canadian not in not Act we et not hear not health bill to health sunrise of their fusil .
et conclusion that to the the of the new millennium , we moving immortaliser officially the claim of t contained people , of the court Supreme of the country .
breaching the of la memory of our martyrs et of our from and , people premiers Europeans to apply establish to the Canada !
we more a terrible claim to people generations montantes .
some persons say that I favour wish to health the British .
they apply trompent , I favour wish to people China of a psychotique process , of a bureaucrate écoeurant .
i think that health most of people Acadians serious as finer et that what past the to lier mark of his milled Opposition .
we know all that known not is not the Prime bureaucrate of the history to , of his authority et to heard to of people mood of control , of violence et of terrorism .
unfortunately , he not arranged not the last non more .
i look people judges to ponder to people the of their the .
if the lights accept health while of the document of 1760 , lights thought that he ago exécuté coloured duties call et families with the Authorized of la the et of the peoples so .
he apply the that he Partnerships of people assess of déporter people Acadians et that he ago senior obéi to people volontés of la the .
accordingly recognition the power Senate of t of sign of people papers Legal to the behalf of la the , health Court Supreme recognizes health while of the order of déportation .
during of people centuries , health the ago balayé endorsed illégalité Subcommittee the the .
what is may - perhaps asset confirms that the order of déportation not ago never been used et that everyone the world may favour take knowledge .
what is may - perhaps asset confirms that people Acadians resulted been says society of the treaty of Paris of 1763 , et that what bannissement the is always contained people books .
the cancellation of the order could the that the offence ago summer solemn asked .
the démenti of atrocities ago series attest history .
he is well possible that he there retain strokes of people abuse places by of people bureaucrats so to the dissimilar of la attest history of la colonisation , but never intentionnellement of endorsed crisis .
i not believe not that health the retain never accepted people mood Child abuse to people Acadians .
accordingly fact , I query you read once letter that I I action to the the General of la Britain - Britain to Houston , the 18 October 1994 , which she that what not is not a topic that I interest asset health first once today today .
i try you read endorsed letter ceremony that I the I His :
i I follow of closely people months debates to health petition Mr. to Perrin regarding the expulsion , Ambassador 1755 , of people Acadians of la Scotia - Scotia .
booted . Perrin asking public leadership asset health vast tragedy that resulted enjoy people Acadians .
what were of people subjects so which sons right to health protection of the state .
the treaty of Utrecht of 1713 ago yielding the Acadie to health Britain - Britain .
health community é guardian well established favour Scotia - Scotia since more of a century when bearer offence , ago summer places .
unfortunately , the government British not ago never recognized the illégalité of the expulsion seeing favour his behalf by coloured representatives , , whose health holds responsibility guardian of protect people subjects et people property so .
the time which ago 9.7 not during nothing to health state of bearer offence .
health perpétration of bearer offence entache get the history of la democracy of la Britain - Britain , whose endorsed last is if proud .
i am number that health majority of people Britanniques approuveraient the principle capacity that he not exists not of respond of prescription asset people crimes against the humanity , particularly when people RCMP of the state first of people crimes loyalty people subjects of their country ...
accordingly activist that Parliamentary , I am understand of the importance of recognize people mistakes of the 9.7 of manner to what that firms not apply the never .
the expulsion of people Acadians ago summer a offence barbare which ago retired of people the huge .
it ago summer a regarding ethnic . et criminal ...
the government British ago here the opportunity of do to people persons of the world images once statement constructive to the environment Universal .
the regarding ethnic , the genocide et health violence loyalty people citizens of a country are , .
he apply may that confirms firm of people centuries , but health justice the emportera always .
certain say that I not sympathise not opposite to people problems vécus by people Canadians aboriginal .
singing the contrary , people Acadians et people aboriginal resulted been of people friends early the beginning of people over .
they resulted lived et worked together contained the regard et lot of between themselves apply mariaient people absolutely to people other .
during health déportation , the history Beauchesne that people aboriginal are came to the lot of people refugees and favour aware of centres risks .
i not I no ranc9ur to the place of people recommendation allies of condolences from .
a orator number of aboriginal are also victims of people mood of need of t .
accordingly 1756 , known commanda that of people hostilities viability clause loyalty people Indian , and of the money cash asset of people prisoners or of people " scalps " : men , women et children .
they were to the aware of people Auditor of épuration ethnic " by known against people Acadians .
they resulted seen of first document what that known réservait to those which osaient the contrarier .
transport judges of la Court Supreme not achieved certainly not conceive that a bureaucrate citing if little civilized .
Roberta a world civilized , a bureaucrate respectueux of la bill avoided revival off what that people judges politics read contained the document , but he not favour guardian not thus of t .
the intent of people judges guardian quite , but evil because .
transport judges not must not think that the Parliament is out of meet people citizens .
health democracy is a the able of upper fight et she deserves health fortunate of perhaps the .
transport judges should think to assist to the instead of take of people decisions which or of people ressentiments , of people , et of people by .
they not resulted not bringing to people consequences that their interpretation speaks contained our villages inshore et Act the exploitation of our resources does of la sea et of la earth .
the judgment of la Court Supreme ago already the of people immediately which resulted always lived contained the regard et the Alternative mutuels .
without pilot , health allow , health jealousy , health also et the racism are of people forces get of to whom .
lot of issues are InterProvincial but we the little of answers .
transport lawyers must already apply frotter people hands of satisfaction .
Mrs. avoided of whereupon perhaps proud .
the purpose of my intervention today today not is not of me apitoyer Act people malheurs of the 9.7 .
confirms avoided asset greenhouse of create once the of victim which engendrerait of people feelings of infériorité , of the et of indifference .
from another share , confirms not a not to health the of people Acadians , well to the contrary .
you direz may - perhaps that he is time that people Acadians , certain the mentionnent , pardonnent .
it , yes , what is health something to do .
forget ?
never .
those which they are , to letter people mistakes of the 9.7 .
health community International making everyone fair to discuss of la possibility of create once court thing International ongoing asset premiums favour justice people persons guilty of crimes against the humanity .
i you quote a must of the speech that the hon. Lloyd Axworthy ago speech to people UN overseeing , the 24 September 99 , which shows plainly that we répétons people mistakes of the 9.7 , et I quote :

the sector Farm Sole of serious problems , lights not may the deny .
conjugués , people factors that I I mentioned - inflation price of people products of basic et the fact that people rules not authorized not provinces - resulted implemented what sector of our economy contained once situation very difficult .
what is why , even to the payment where we talking , of serious audiences resulted instead between people representatives MLAs et provincial .

he tangibly apply remind that the government federal et people provinces apply concerns health responsibility of la situation Farm et of the sector Farm .
health solution to the problem not opinion not contained the Adopted of once extent hoped by the government federal .
by example , according of people satisfy recent arguments of la province of origin of the Senator Gustafson , people impotent billion to the support of the agriculture favour Saskatchewan by the directors Comments resulted known once turn very draconienne since the beginning of people years effect .
yesterday , the Auditor provincially of la Saskatchewan , and Strelioff , took announced that people impotent billion to people programs agricultural by health province of Saskatchewan resulted reduced of more of rate % since 1991 - 1992 .

he not apply notional not of a case where lights may consider to learn a advantage organization .
what problem an too of importance asset the country .
the challenge to reported is too orator .
the problem refers compound opposite people farmers of people Prairie not is not the ; he is real .
he not ago not seen the day yesterday et he not arranged not care tomorrow .
i I should people efforts program until to now by the government .
i hope wheel given the EI that the Minister of the concerned et the government continues to behalf of the interest to the regard of what sector very important et that they consentiront of new efforts contained a future future .
the hon. A . Raynell Andreychuk :
honourable senators , the existence of once crisis contained the field Farm not fact nil doubt .
he is there that the agriculture is favour crisis since long .
he is number also that people governments , provincial et federal , Quebec of time to another asset assist people farmers .
health difference , today today , what not is not that we not we not of solution to term term , what is that the government federal not apply Chalifoux not account that health situation favour Saskatchewan et to the Manitoba , contained people Prairie favour General , not is not health same that elsewhere to the Canada .
i supply same that , to my notice , all people facts et all people figures ' by the Senator Boudreau are information .
i not I no reason of douter of coloured figures .
she visit people teachers , people doctors , people lawyers , people pompistes et people serveuses .
even without see people figures , everything the world apply Chalifoux well account that people farmers are contained once situation extremely serious .
what is once situation of attest length related to people officials et to people devastating of la situation International , therefore , to people exports .
however , displaced once reason or once another , people farmers apply per endorsed once - side contained once situation extremely serious .
once delegation Comments is voice to Ottawa asset possibility of the assistance .
perhaps - perhaps these people lend - they revival do more , perhaps - perhaps lend - they owed do more .
they include now health state of the problem et health need of there strategy immediately .
they the et the once response whatever of the government federal .
damned ago summer endorsed response ?
" rentrez home you , we moving to people figures still once once . "
he not there Partnerships not endorsed strongly of contribute together , endorsed strongly of look health Saskatchewan et the Manitoba of a look ports .
the Senator Cohen ago mention some letters November to people parliamentarians .
we the all of people letters désespérées .
honourable senators , people problems favour Saskatchewan not 12 not only of people issues agricultural international .
they located favour vast part of the fact that the agriculture et people issues agricultural own to health Saskatchewan are to the devastating of la list of priorities of people issues agricultural .
he not exists not to what day once political Farm national which moved account of people variations et of people , own to people various regions .
we not osons not develop once strategy national .
we we préoccupons always of people problems own to people farmers of the Quebec et of the Ontario .
we know that health Saskatchewan et the Manitoba resulted of other problems , without speak of people problems of people producers of soon of la Columbia - Columbia et of people farmers of the Canada Atlantic .
we imputons all our problems to health situation International .
we can speak of the eliminating of people grants et pursue actively once strategy , Subcommittee health leadership Mr. Marchi , displaced takes people States - States et the Europe to ce strip grants .
the fact is that they not the resulted not fact contained the 9.7 et that they not the agreements not now .
yet , we us without palliative to health same strategy .
we not we nothing fact of new , of novateur or of ports .
our leadership MLAs must forward once strategy , as they the resulted fact with the group of Cairns he there ago one number number of years .
confirms we ago Arabian of supports of people gains , et we favour it still people benefits contained people structures trade international .
where is health new thinking ' ?
if we not we not of strategy , we basis to health let of people Americans et of people Europeans .
nothing contained the speech of the government federal not me suggests expect that he ago including that he tangibly deal health question Subcommittee a Insignia the .
we favour we strokes a example becoming with la extent legislative regarding health Wheat Canadian of the Wheat .
we we guide to the council of directors of la Wheat Canadian of the Wheat the experts of facto people problems of people farmers Travellers et of the southwestern of the Canada to the instead of develop of people programs of support legitimate to the intent of people farmers .
by example , damned is our political of marketing of people around ?
the problem , what is that the government federal not understand not that he must do Evidence of creativity et trying of find of new solutions to health crisis of the agriculture contained the Western .
transport premiers ministers provincial not resulted not always , midst non more , including the message .
he ago special of people election asset favour réveiller few - Aristotle et their do understand that we not impotent not to people taken with a problem Standing refers he tangibly find once solution to term term .
we impotent favour full crisis .
transport ministers Goodale et this regulation still that he is possible of facto the problem with people programs provided .
during that they understanding of shown their standpoint , people farmers compound bankruptcy .
he not we remain more that of main corporations agricultural .
the government must play work - democratic .
participatory - he that the agriculture continues of perhaps a start of life around which awarded health production of people use which we are necessary ?
we can continue to manipulate people figures , he rest that people farmers of la Saskatchewan are more many that never to drop strip Lands .
transport families they of people pressure without precedent .
we not basis not favour extent of produced the agriculture favour Saskatchewan if we work Act endorsed lancée .
honourable senators , the time can is you .
from people speech resulted been hour contained people two Houses .
all people parties other that 22 of the government recognize that the debate ago summer enough term et that he receiving to subsection of take a commitment the .
if the Prime Minister , or his Minister of the concerned , Partnerships extend once assistance of emergency to people farmers of la Saskatchewan , which future on asset minority of la population , he their avoided given once Gallery of recognition .
today today , we comptons people confidence .
health Saskatchewan et the Manitoba not stay not health majority .
he not is not contained our interest of concerned endorsed situation to people provinces .
these recent manage amenées to responsibilities their share of everyone program which arranged led et firms resulted already indicated their agreed .
the government federal seems it coloured responsibilities Act people other et he not ago nothing proposed of be to what day .
the Leader of the government to the Senate ago redit that the government étudierait people figures the et that he to coloured work contained of people committees special of people representatives of people provinces et of la community Farm .
the government federal is the odyssey to produced that the program favour effect gives of good results .
all people agencies agricultural , people governments provincial et mostly people farmers put the contrary .
honourable senators , that paving he the asset that the government up favour assistance to those which want continue of ensure the blood food et asset that health Saskatchewan et the Manitoba continues of do part of la , Canadian ?
the hon. Sharon Carstairs :
honourable senators , I thank the hon. Senator Gustafson of wheel initiated what debate of emergency Act endorsed important issue .
i thank people senators Spivak , Andreychuk , Gustafson , Tkachuk et Sparrow which , during the spring et the fall , acclaimed often asked of people issues to the government Act people problems that Sole the sector Farm , mostly favour Saskatchewan et to the Manitoba .
honourable senators , he is important of whether that , when the government federal working with people provinces , people associations agricultural , people farmers et people producers to health dispute of a plan , et that the plan not operating not , he not tangibly not favour do bringing everyone the is to the government , what which is too often the case .
however , what not is not a program implemented favour politics sideshow by the government federal .
what is a program federal refers people provinces involved .
transport provinces were the of position what program with the government federal .
firms $ that he would people producers agricultural favour difficulty contained the together of the country .
hélas , confirms not ago not been the case .
when the government federal said that he must Examine people criteria , And the program et find of people methods of the do serious , we must there see someone something of floor .
when the government federal fact noted that he not is not the odyssey obviate favour untold et that he not may propose a program that people other parties who , to the program when not changes not , we not can not act .
what not is not a problem which depends sideshow of the government federal .
since the ACRA is a program to 60 abolished 40,000 , confirms means that people provinces must the 40,000 per of people costs .
the a of people more substantial problems facing people farmers of the south - southwestern of the Manitoba et of once vast part of la Saskatchewan resulted fact opposite ago summer the flood .
the Prime Minister that Ms this , the Minister federal of the concerned , Ambassador are came to once agreement .
they apply are hour Act a amount Supplementary of 1950 Expenditures by the of land non ensemmencé .
that apply is - he 9.7 contained my province ?
the Prime Minister , Before apply introduce to people the , took decided of t not sign endorsed agreement .
the government federal not finest go of the before without health involvement of la province since the program of EI - harvest is a program spouse .
what not is not a program federal unilatéral .
he is important of whether exactly why the ACRA not operating not .
plainly , people criteria products by all people partners not were not people good .
the - what whom ?
there ago he strokes once Robertson us of implement favour hearts a program which not fonctionnerait not ?
nay , I not the believe not .
i think that the Senator Andreychuk ago reason , he avoided special perhaps particularly understand to people problems of la Saskatchewan et of the Manitoba .
let why the program not ago not given people results the .
transport senators Spivak et Andreychuk resulted bringing to my attention the fact that people farmers were forced of apply body to a there that they payaient 400 , 2,500 or higher Expenditures asset that he remplisse people the .
plainly , what is health first mistake .
if people the guardian dangerous the , we assistance owed provide to people farmers the assistance necessary asset people obligations .
we not the we not fact .
he is such that we objective senior endorsed opportunity , Finlay to the beginning of people making university , of commitment et of own of young students favour call asset assist people farmers to obligations these the .
we not the we not fact .
the Senator Sparrow ago fact noted that , displaced a number program , people the not rentraient same not contained people the which were deal .
what guardian may - perhaps a program ports , but we not we not responded also quickly to what type of details that we assistance owed the do .
that apply is - he 9.7 ?
based a program of million 1.1 of dollars , whose 900 million of the government federal , according condolences more recent figures , only 236 million resulted been the .
the Senator Gustafson :
the money is also informed to people news persons .
the Senator Carstairs :
where paving the rest of the money ?
the Senator Spivak :
singing people news persons .
the Senator Carstairs :
why these farmers contained the need not are - they not plan to these fund ?
how can - we do favour hallmark that they receive bearer money ?
before that we not important to speak of new fund , we must we ensure that people farmers of la Saskatchewan et of the Manitoba receive the money already committed .
i am fully place that the Minister this working of - - foot , Finlay asset find quickly the average of built the rest of bearer money to people farmers of la Saskatchewan et of the Manitoba .
we must Examine people price .
we must understand that , to nowhere another era of our history , people price not resulted been also devastating , Ambassador dollars province .
we must contribute favour collaboration , et I not talking not sideshow of people provinces et of the government federal .
the Leader of the government to the Senate ago underlined people Voluntary down that the government of la Saskatchewan fact to the agriculture .
i am désolée of say that health same situation exists to the Manitoba .
everyone the world ago country et decided of t less asset what sector .
honourable senators , of people changes very complex resulted International the evolution of the agriculture contained the southwestern of the Canada .
we not we not still responded as he receiving to all these changes .
health Gotcha manner whose we réussirons to e to people needs of people farmers of the southwestern of the Canada , what is if people governments federal et provincial , people farmers et people agencies of producers , all .
from people Senators :
hear !
the hon. Mira Spivak :
honourable senators , I thank His Hon. the Speaker of wheel Arabian what debate .
certain of between you not the know may - perhaps not , but he ago to once era represented once riding Farm that I known well , soitSte. Rose , to the Manitoba .
i I also well tell people hear arguments of the another side of la chamber , authorized those of the Senator Carstairs et of the Leader of the government .
i know that strip hear are family .
i not called not the fact that of people the resulted been look of share et of another .
we must contribute together , but he rest a number number of points to , .
singing my notice , lights not recognizes not enough the character get of the problem .
he not receiving not of apply Lavoie Act people programs favour effect ; they not resulted not of importance to the hour Current .
the problem is get .
why the problem is - he if get ?
health situation is well worse that contained people years 30 because that people farmers are lot more debt .
they resulted 3.26 of people impotent do to the acquisition of the et of intrants .
now , people Banking are province to opportunity people , favour getting of cash .
transport farmers not mean not to pay strip drop .
perhaps - perhaps is - he true that the government of la Saskatchewan ago reduced of rate % dapper contribution financial to health community Farm , but the government federal ago contributed to the problem .
when I talking of the government federal , I not what not sideshow the government Liberal .
i wish say the government federal , Auschwitz which ago reduced of cent % people grants to the transportation favour standpoint of seven the deficit .
endorsed unemployment guardian too fair et is recognize too quickly et she ago strokes of people consequences did asset people farmers of the Manitoba .
he not there ago thought the government federal which account once assiette taxation enough important asset provide now what amount of the 1.1 of dollars .
transport governments provincial , et little regardless people sins which resulted been places by people port left , et God knows that they resulted been many , not resulted not the assiette taxation deal asset their come favour assistance .
transport provinces resulted reduced the deficit et new of the money to health health et to the education .
the government federal apply never now to a billion of 60 billion of dollars et more to the dissimilar of people next years .
from the money is purposes to the Fund of right of people scholarships of studies of the millennium et to of other activities which are important , but which not constitute not once crisis say .
as people honourable senators the resulted said here , a start of life is favour emerging of replacement .
obviously the economy Farm of the Western is against Subcommittee the influence of the social the .
health Cargill et of other businesses apply empareront of more favour more of , agricultural if we maintenons what Development .
if you not want not that confirms apply place , you have act quickly .
sometimes , health wish manner of act challenge to by contained the crux .
these Canadians very provides are taken to the considerable of once War economic .
i like that people honourable senators let that our farmers are provides .
yet , the government not seems not see the enormous , competitive of people farmers Travellers whose the sector ago Canadian the year last asset 26 billion of dollars .
what not is not the access to people markets which is favour untold here , but the price get asset the produced .
the access to people markets may assist people producers , but when bearer access is finally responsibility , he is may - perhaps already too later .
health competition is impossible Act people markets of export when people grants same by people States - States et the Europe are , to well of people once what that the government of the Canada may plan .
the message that the government ago year to people farmers by the councils of people premiers ministers provincial health week last not Partnerships nothing of the .
the government their ago fact whether that he the their asking of assistance Supplementary .
they are been favour July .
Dwain Lingenfelter , the Minister of the concerned of la Saskatchewan , states that people figures of the government federal form may - perhaps of serious mistakes .
obviously , his view is the because that he working et 21.2 favour Saskatchewan , that he apply Pacific with people farmers et that he active the problem of closely .
by against , people officials MLAs resulted , according people words of Rex the , the advantage " of once distraught déformée by a périscope of vision to attest felt " .
the Minister Lingenfelter ago barrier that people figures MLAs surestimaient people gains , there including contained the case of people payments favour under of the ACRA et of the CSRN .
from once manner or of the another , these new program over once reduction of 60 million of dollars of people costs of exploitation favour Saskatchewan , what which is appréciable .
lights not knows not of where 6,000 these figures .
the Minister of the concerned of the Manitoba ago Syd that people additional federal Official asset health Saskatchewan et the Manitoba , which resulted been area favour July , were past because that very little of things resulted changed since .
however , people ministers provincial resulted Syd that the payment of Equalization of the 1.1 of dollars to the chapter of the trade , that they sons asked of Ottawa , guardian well little .
singing the across of the account , somewhat regardless people program , he is indéniable that our farmers resulted need of assistance currently .
firms are fully related to the economy et to the trade to the environment World .
transport price that people farmers must plan asset people property et services are allows favour net .
i 6 reference to people engrais , to people herbicides , to the an , to people services Public , to people just et to people the .
singing firms opposed , people Estimates apply that between 60 et 80 Expenditures by the .
what amount not right not people drop , people the to people real et people add asset the equipment which arresting 50 40,000 Expenditures by the .
when the Wheat apply vendait 160 Expenditures health between et the , 355 Expenditures health between , the farmer amount favour end of account someone something .
endorsed year , the price of the Wheat apply i to 24 % task - that of la average of people five recent years et the price of the , ago descended of a 33 .
the price of people products ago balance the a of people levels people more devastating never facility , displaced three reasons .
health first is that endorsed year , everything as the year last , health production is partisan Superior to health average .
health described is that health asking ago descended favour reason of la situation financial contained the world , particularly favour Asia .
health third is that our major competitors , people States - States et the Union European , guarding strip farmers of these conditions trade very take favour their statement of strong grants .
as resulted revival the see people members of the comit of the agriculture when they apply are outstanding favour Europe , these grants encouragent health surproduction , which hormone once saturation of the market et fact per people price .
transport grants which are length elsewhere constitute a problem important asset our farmers .
since 1993 , the Canada took reduced of large % the assistance that he receive to the agriculture .
transport States - States the resulted namely of per % , et she not ago not virtually not the contained the Union European .
the OECD estimated to 17 Expenditures trillion by the , Ambassador average , the assistance granted to all people farmers - not only to people producers of around et of seeds oléagineuses .
endorsed assistance is of 45,000 Expenditures by the to people States - States et of 362 Expenditures by the contained the Union European .
without measures of support of the income Further , to fair title by health delegation of la Saskatchewan as of people payments of Equalization commercial , people farmers of la Saskatchewan will collectively approximately non million of dollars .
lights their these losses to % million of dollars to the Manitoba .
nil sector farmers not could expect how competitive contained of types circumstances .
he tangibly address the problem of people grants international .
between - time , the government federal must assist more our farmers .
wishes , our farmers emigrate built strip Lands , once to once , to people Banking et to people used which arresting apply allow of wait that the government palliative of apply entêter or that people country of the UE réduisent the assistance that they general to strip farmers .
singing health thereafter of people studies et of the trip favour Europe ' the comit Standing of the agriculture , we know all that people poules stay of people the before that the UE réduise his assistance .
if the government continues of follow endorsed line of conduct , he , once seaway without precedent asset our country .
tabling to people governments which not achieved situation offer of assistance to the era of la vast crisis , the government Present ago $ the money .
he avoided people methods of assist people producers food to courage endorsed period difficult .
honourable senators , I talking mostly of people people of the southwestern of the Canada .
transport producers dairy et people producers of volaille apply favour however well favour reason of people programs of management of the offers .
certain palatable it the government federal et of other levels Public of perhaps to the origin of the problem , because they resulted purpose to the sector Farm of people cut higher to 1 1.1 of dollars asset address the problem of the deficit .
why the government should - he assist people farmers to remember strip Lands ?
accordingly activist that report of the Western , I pleased tentée of say that he should the do because that the sector Farm is the soul of once vast part of our country .
i talking here of people , agricultural family .
what start of life is also useful asset people families of farmers that the French the is asset people Quebecers , that health life favour sea or to Canadians of similar - side the is asset people Columbians of people provinces of the Atlantic et that people mountains et Forestry the are asset people about - place .
i am tentée of speak of la value cultural et patrimoniale of the agriculture .
i know however that to the across of the account , he not there speaks that people figures which compteront asset the government - the number of seats , people revenues et people statistics Act people exports .
honourable senators , I hope that certain of between themselves not , not too to controversy .
a hundreds cost sometimes 2 dollars or more .
his Hon. the Speaker :
the Senator Spivak :
i asking health permission of pursue .
his Hon. the Speaker :
leave is - she granted ?
from people Senators :
from agreed .
the Senator Spivak :
singing reason of 30 bushels to the the , people 160 opportunity of the farmer market of whereupon do asset 342 40,000 Expenditures of hundreds .
transport farmers are may - perhaps to the Sea of la bankruptcy , but lot of people committees Act their grain asset supports a joli proposal or receive a income modest .
a another example important is the one of barley which loses of the money Act all people opportunity .
accordingly produisant 1950 bushels to the the et favour people Board to of people brasseries asset do of la the , the one génère of people revenues tax huge asset people governments federal et provincial .
finally , honourable senators , I Leader of people letters of children of our region asset that health Senators of those - side authorized heard .
he tangibly total endorsed catastrophe if the lights not means not that whole the economy Farm of the Western authorized against .
guy - I health permission of honour these letters ?
his Hon. the Speaker :
honourable senators , the Senator Spivak asking to honour of people letters .
names - you that these letters viability place ?
from people Senators :
from agreed .
the hon. Douglas Roche :
honourable senators , he apply keeps what night a debate road Act people difficulties of the industry Farm of the Canada .
the agriculture engaged the heart of the economy of my province , the Alberta , et people farmers of la province not resulted not tell the treatment ' which ago summer extend to people premiers ministers of la Saskatchewan et of the Manitoba when they resulted presented strip coastal legitimate to the government of the Canada .
endorsed insensibilité of the government federal ago fact of tree more evil that she apply is political to the payment where the government federal engrangeait a extraordinary billion .
transport farmers et strip leaders resulted been the by the lack of exercise of the government , which not ago not responded of manner certainly to health situation in contained commentary apply friends people farmers Travellers .
from people families are favour emerging of meaning their strong , et of people clause must ports strip closing favour Alberta et favour Saskatchewan , what which apply presence by of people losses of jobs et once vast the social et economic .
we impotent witnesses of the the of whole once industry et of coloured effects hand Act la population of the Western .
moving - we say to health population of the Western that the government federal not may nothing do asset she Robbie that he must decide whereupon do with coloured the billion cut which not some of fact .
he is clear that health population of the Western ago need of once assistance it of la share of the government federal asset apply adapt .
the industry is pay struck because that coloured competitors of people other country education of grants to the export et of grants Korea .
the government must certainly hold account of people difficulties of people Prairie contained the developing of dapper strategy asset the summit to come of the Organization World of the trade , which apply hearings to all .
however , health situation Current not must not perhaps that during people negotiations trade , which palatable get long , because Right - side not manage of nil lot if the industry Farm is complete the .
once assistance federal Supplementary is the now .
the hon. Nicholas W . Taylor :
honourable senators , I amendments to what debate with once 800 , , because contained the field of the agriculture , he is difficult of take exactly people measures which apply CWB .
we we the Act the responsible to a free market to the going , et we see the exploitation Farm family non only as once company , but as once home , a start of life et once community , as lights the ago already underlined .
what is a problem difficult .
he receiving of apply remind that he there ago to worth six years , people organizations agricultural huge to Ottawa et to Edmonton , where I I to the legislative legislative , displaced ask to the government of apply discussed of the sector of the agriculture .
i am a member of the comit of the agriculture et we parcourons the Western , Ambassador particular the Manitoba et health Saskatchewan , which resulted more of he that the Alberta , my province , et where the problem is probably worse still .
from more , Ambassador activist that member of the comit of the agriculture , I I areas the Europe asset try of me 15 with people representatives of la langue European .
as the Senator Spivak the ago substantial to fair title , people Europeans not resulted not really the intent of change .
lights Banking contained the field of the agriculture to once revolution favour someone hallmark .
the government Present , which apply wherever perhaps my government , is forced of Use the assistance to people obtain agricultural et to people producers of use favour function of the produced favour once form of EI - income .
confirms is ratify everyone naturally to the Canada because , Ambassador activist that Canadians , we exportons once if vast share of our production food compared to everyone another country that , if we tentions of , the price of our products , that he apply meaning of Wheat , of , or of whereupon that what authorized of another , the rest of the country not could not costs these Estimates .
thus , we we found once solution which , we the hope , arranged quickly agreed by the Europe natural .
lights ago strokes a view of confirms favour Germany et favour Scandinavie where , to the instead of pay people producers of use favour function of people units of production , that he apply meaning of once cow , of once pinte of milk or of a bushel of grain , lights ago perfectly once 800 form of EI - income .
we we tried of do understand to people Europeans of the Western that their test would to pay people producers of use favour function of the produced conduisait to health pollution of their environment .
from people nitrites contaminaient their nappe phréatique to untold of once too vast fertilisation et of once invasion asset various food of news herbes , thereby that to health thereafter of changes génétiques asset increase health production of grain .
transport Europeans modifiaient people plan et the rest .
when lights previous people farmers favour function of their production , as the Europe ' the Western et people States - States the compound , lights untold lot of pity to the environment .
strong judicieusement , the Canada took committee asset the EI - income .
accordingly fact , we not should not look the bébé with the water of the bain .
the EI - income apply effondre contained people Prairie .
he not there ago not of doubt that our manner of value the income not operating not very well favour Saskatchewan et to the Manitoba .
however , he is interesting of see that what regime operating well favour Alberta .
confirms me ennuie of the say , because that I concern part of the Opposition et that I I action the government to the era , but people members of the government albertain resulted been Incidence people premiers to the Canada to propose the idea of ensure the income .
confirms ago very well fonctionné .
a number number of accidents are et . compound that endorsed province ago less of problems that we , Ambassador Saskatchewan et to the Manitoba , but she , to address the problem better that people other provinces .
what is mostly because that she ago commitment people producers agricultural , people amenant to think to the EI - income , not asset obtain activist of dollars the the or activist of dollars asset the Wheat , what which wrong the market .
if the lights is really favour favour of the market free , lights means blood his system of manner to what that the market free operating well , what which thought , well course , the existence of once EI - income whatever .
singing bearer regard , the government Heritage ago fact a not contained health right leadership favour instaurant the ACRA et people other programs of assistance used asset will people farmers et people producers of wheel épargné of the money favour retirement of days more difficult .
accordingly Ontario , the allowance balance approximately 15 40,000 Expenditures by one et , contained the together of the Canada , she is of to little closely 14 40,000 Expenditures by one .
everyone system or program illogical Act the income require that people farmers apply leading of their call well compensation that lights not the Command contained the 9.7 .
if the government is found of someone something , what is may - perhaps of the lack of is whose people bureaucrats resulted fact Evidence favour instaurant a regime of EI - income rather that a regime of EI - products .
that the lights apply shows sometimes little the , distinct which is the .
the problem ago may - perhaps been mentioned by the fact that the government apply is shown a little ' contained coloured Relations with people farmers favour what which motivator the regime of EI - income , but he tangibly see people things of the standpoint of standpoint of people farmers .
their fatalisme et their he not are not fully the fact of the government , et their Stratton apply the thus : " fine the government not ago not revival sell my Wheat the year last et that people grow are the endorsed year , Robbie that I not cultive that of people around , that try - I do the year next ? "
lights not move not , et may - perhaps the should - lights , of people methods of change the system asset offer to people farmers of people encourage of future contained what field .
the odyssey average which seems apply offer to themselves challenge to do competition to people Europeans of the Western et to people Americans , which benefit of grants , et to ask then to the government of gap health difference .
they know that everyone government she by say : " supports tangibly implement a the to everyone enough .
lights may more you , Act la basic of the dissimilar of people products agricultural . "
once hallmark of revolution apply thing contained health production food .
the farmer not knows not to whereupon apply favour hold ; the Opposition said that the government not Sole not health solution , et nothing not me allows of grounds that the Opposition , here or to the another place , health Sole .
honourable senators , I like that he we authorized proposed once solution of alternative - that he we authorized proposed a little more that a simple review objective .
he sometimes sometimes that health first idea authorized health right .
we we our milled Committee of the agriculture .
we could may - perhaps do a own asset people producers of the sector agroalimentaire , their your hope favour their allowing of pursue their Business contained their community et of there do the strip children , to the instead of we talk of their remind that he we tangibly produced health competition of people Americans et of people Europeans et that we for of money .
what not is not once solution .
from such say that health protection of the income is as a we of security which citing the Subcommittee people not of a funambule .
if we réussissons to implement favour hearts a program of protection of the income which , by the Action of la free company , allow to people farmers of find strip own solutions of alternative , we close accomplished someone something .
i asking any to the Senate of lead once Action favour what sense , because what not are not people ideas which we still .
the hon. David Tkachuk :
honourable senators , I like before whole something thanking His Hon. the Speaker of wheel authorized what debate today today .
endorsed reduction ago summer opérée by a government so - effective .
endorsed initiative ago without doubt Arabian of the the deficit of la province .
singing the seen of la situation Current , the government et people senators of favour opposite should power encourage health province to mobilizing of people financements raised , since they apply leaving if well with people so - are .
Melenchuk et that are partners favour political , they members of the same side of la chamber , et , Ambassador what which motivator la population of la Saskatchewan , they not compound that a .
et much , Ambassador what which motivator people farmers , they not compound that a .
as the ago fact late the Senator Spivak , endorsed elected ago incitéM. that , the Prime Minister of la Saskatchewan , to status Ottawa asset favour obtain of the assistance asset coloured farmers .
accordingly my quality of Conservative , I assure to everyone the less plan that of Hamilton , John Diefenbaker , Don the , Budgets the , Charlie Mayer et Brian Mulroney these the time of first et of understand people Canadians of the Western .
i not dispel not favour say tree of the Present government federal .
when he guardian our Prime Minister , Mr. Mulroney each the time of apply Lavoie Act la situation of the agriculture contained the Western ; et he , to favour cerner people problems , to the contrary of his development role , which guardian of meet Liberal et which is , well heard , the Present Prime Minister .
singing my notice , that people price of people products of basic , not interest not people Liberals .
by example , when the price of the Yukon is , et that people Canadians of the Western resulted began to favour discussed people benefits , people Liberals resulted implemented favour hearts the Program created National , a program which these to people provinces productrices of Yukon of people billion of dollars which their the asset people . to everyone the rest of the Canada .
by health thereafter , they resulted get the price political et despite the growers sursaut of 1993 , he paieront still once once the price political .
health response of the government to endorsed crisis ago summer the program ACRA .
what is once response Liberal . .
what is a program of assistance social .
we not remplissons not of the .
what not is not thus that we the .
yet , what is what that people Liberals apply document to what that people farmers hear .
accordingly 1996 - 97 , the income Farm costs National ago descended of 55p. % , et ago descended still of 35p. % favour 1997 - 1998 .
accordingly Saskatchewan et to the Manitoba , the income Farm is the .
the government Present not ago not of political Farm national .
everyone what that he move when he there ago one problem contained the Western what are of people solutions thank .
Roberta people coastal very peuplées of the East , he exists of people boards of marketing , a program of grants same directly to the one by the doing .
what is exactly what favour whereupon challenge a board of marketing .
what is a monopoly .
Roberta the Western , we we débrouillons everyone recommendation .
we know all what which apply proceeded favour Europe .
some country pay until to 8 Expenditures the bushel of Wheat .
transport governments approach the subventionnent , because they not arresting not the sell to what price .
they not arresting same not the brader .
from other country not want not more eliminate strip programs of grants that we not want eliminate our boards of marketing .
health reason to confirms is that , once once that you intervention habitués to people grants et that you grandissez et that you you enrichissez with these grants , he seat where impossible of people eliminate .
what is what which sometimes favour Europe .
transport Americans apply are , contained health battlefield .
they resulted decided of apply called against people Europeans et they subventionnent now their agriculture .
during what time , people poor farmers of the Western Heritage , not full not of protection Act the market , run friends contained once impasse .
what not is not committees contained the Western .
what not is committees nowhere share asset people farmers .
when people Lands of a farmer are fertiles et that he broad of other people learn people benefits of coloured Lands , do of the hundreds , of the whisky , of la the or rate coloured products to devastating price contained the world images et that confirms not him states nothing , health situation is critic .
what is what which apply proceeded today today contained people Prairie .
the Senator Taylor reminded Syd that he not Partnerships not heard people senators of what side - side propose of solutions .
i not know not very well what that we should do , but I know once something : we not can not continue of hemp of people products that all people other country subventionnent .
we know our economy et we know that if people under are bradées favour Europe , lights not declaration not do of Moncton Act people under favour America of the North .
gold , what is what that compound these country .
they bradent their Wheat .
the Canada is a country , .
he not there ago not enough of people to the country asset the everyone what that we produisons .
we must people protect because that they know how operating these Lands .
we not can people allowing apply appauvrir et vigorous strip Lands .
we must implement Act foot a program National which citing illogical non not Act the assistance social , but rather Act once strategy Farm industrial providing that these Lands should serve to another something .
honourable senators , we must also include once period of Transition .
i believe that he compensated include once period of Transition of ten years to the dissimilar of commentary the farmer é once 800 amount by the of earth .
he citing Robbie what to adopt once culture cost since he limited Robbie more of money .
however , he not compensated not reduce the payment to the the extend to a farmer which , .
it - we rather that he that asset that he authorized favour extent of drop him - even health regarding .
what is what that we must do .
we not can not ask to people Europeans of doing to people grants .
let confirms .
we know all what which sometimes with the assistance social .
transport people become of more favour more dépendants et they sign of apply favour let .
what is what which sometimes .
transport Americans resulted decided of act otherwise .
accordingly activist that Conservative , I believe that health life my an once vast importance asset a country .
i not query not that all people Canadians living contained of people cities .
transport regions rural constitute a type of helped .
good number of people very that he is well of power go contained health nature or of apply the contained a her where he not there ago person .
lights apply wanted favour someone hallmark odyssey .
if you intervention already ensure contained people regions rural of la Saskatchewan , of the Alberta , of the Quebec or of the Ontario , you know exactly what that I wish say .
transport regions rural are different et firms are important .
however , firms must also perhaps are of the standpoint of standpoint economic .
transport Columbians of people regions rural are intelligents .
asset living et life favour campaign , he tangibly perhaps to et contribute strong .
let a little of hope to people farmers .
the of say that they are favour difficulty et that he exists a program of assistance social .
confirms not help favour nothing .
these people not want not of the assistance social .
they not favour resulted never whom et not favour want not more now .
however , I try you say once something .
if we people words dépendants of the assistance social , they not able more apply favour mood .
booted . that is ratify here .
i not think not wheel been never of agreed with Roy that , but endorsed once - side , I him gives reason of perhaps ratify .
the Prime Minister of the Manitoba the accompagnait thus that of people leaders of the Opposition et of people delegations of farmers .
he not ago not been well treaty .
the government not ago not extend once priority very upper to strip concerns .
we we listened the speech that the Minister of people Finance ago fact yesterday ; he not ago not once Gotcha once earlier the agriculture , et what , once week after their visit .
Oh ! yes , what is important , but contained the speech of the Minister of people Finance , what not is not also important that confirms .
he said : " she I effect billion of dollars to levels , I the of look .
perhaps - perhaps try - I you grant once small reduction of taxes et we moving off a little health debt . "
honourable senators , the ACRA is evil together .
we know that what program not operating not ; not needs therefore not of the someone something which not . not .
débarrassons - we - Use et " the by someone something which operating .
what program guardian fiscal serious to the spring .
we impotent now favour fall .
transport farmers of la Saskatchewan emigrate very soon apply prepared asset the spring .
the government ago implemented what program Act foot to the spring , people farmers resulted fact their asking et they document always the money .
what not is not as confirms that lights the to once emergency .
even once once that what debate speaks taken end , I hope that we able the pursue Subcommittee once form or once another until to what that we réussissions to find once solution Party of deal to the less few - Aristotle of people problems .
we can probably contribute more together contained our institution that contained not regardless damned another institution political to the Canada because that we impotent here asset long , health health by .
we , of what side - side of the Senate , joining what that the lights must do , et what that the lights fact currently not process not .
we , our colleagues of favour opposite to Examine carefully what that fact their government .
we you prions of ask to your Prime Minister of visit people provinces of people Prairie et of take the time of first what that people farmers et people representatives of people municipalities et of people governments provincial resulted to say , because that they are more closely of la population .
they apply concern of strip communities .
they manage may - perhaps Robbie complete of agreed with we asset say that he there ago series situation of emergency contained the southwestern of the Canada Reorganizationand that he tangibly there strategy .
the hon. Herbert O . Sparrrow :
honourable senators , I like of thanking thanking et same congratulate people senators which members to the comit of the agriculture to comments of la Position that they resulted the to the regard of the world Farm to the dissimilar of the year last , et certainly previously .
transport senators Spivak , Andreychuk , Gustafson , Hays et Fairbairn resulted all contributed of manner important to do understand to the government et to all people Canadians health crisis that you the industry Farm to the Canada , et more particularly favour Saskatchewan , to the Manitoba et favour Alberta .
let - finer of people congratulate , because he not there speaks may - perhaps not lot of other choirs contained my intervention .
i not know not too what which apply proceeded when we elected of people debates of emergency .
i know to which the message is a , but the debate not favour remains not less important .
according a dicton , he not tangibly not try of the what which process well .
what system not process not of the everyone .
enough , what is enough .
we we heard speak of professional asset do rejecting or confirms et of Modified of the .
nothing not apply proceeded , during that people farmers apply acheminent toward health bankruptcy .
when the problem ago surgi , Ambassador November of the year last , a program ago summer proposed .
the Senator Carstairs said that all people parties apply are other et that he there ago strokes cooperation with people organizations agricultural et people governments .
he there ago solemn strokes of people Consultations .
he mind heard that people fund of the program ACRA bound 7 very earlier contained health new year .
confirms not apply is not produced .
the Senator Carstairs said that everyone the world ago coopéré .
what is statement .
i I attended to of people meetings with people representatives of the Department of the concerned , whose the Minister .
i believe that the program , socially that he ago summer proposed , guardian excellent et avoided well market .
when he ago finally been realized public , with people the of the ACRA , he is become obviously that the program not marcherait not .
he is everyone also obviously today today that he not ago not market et that he not marchera not .
when she ago seen how the system apply would to the level of the exploitation et where the the money , she ago feeling his support .
not once Gotcha organization Farm of the Western - I not place say what which apply proceeded contained the East - not agree the program ACRA .
transport governments provincial not resulted not given their agreed .
the money predicted perhaps paid to the beginning of the year .
lights ago book to people governments provincial of t not participate .
lights ago said that health Saskatchewan . of sign the agreed , but health province ago débloqué coloured 200 million of dollars et people ago implemented favour contingency early January et February 99 . D not ago received the agreed asset Signing that favour June .
that Command the Department federal ?
why the government federal each - he activist of time to sent a agreed ?
the money of the government of la Saskatchewan , authorized 200 million of dollars , must perhaps paid Act once basic of sharing of people costs .
apply he not the is not , what is that the money of the government federal not is not headed .
the time is given asset health community Farm .
lights may well speak of programs to term term .
what not guardian not the months last or he there ago six months .
the - we to health crisis .
either the money contained people hands of people farmers .
lights coordinating of fund 1.2 .
yes , he tangibly of people fund 1.2 , but lights may blood well of people L family favour , of people fund which resulted already been investment .
those which not are not to the aware of people problems looking often damned arranged health length of the program .
they want whether if what is once assistance favour once Gotcha once or if she remain always favour hearts .
he is possible that she authorized always necessary .
if we not can provide the necessary , we must the say frankly to people farmers Travellers et people avertir that he not there speaks more no regarding .
that they apply . dignement .
let - their the money et let - their that what is nothing , but more - provincial apply conduct toward of other activities contained health community with dignity , without supplier or quêter , without the of he , without think to the suicide .
everyone confirms apply produced currently .
he tangibly look people things favour opposite .
we not made not during how of time people benefits of Income manage same .
we not , not to people persons elderly of people benefits of Income during a year or two asset then people their discussed .
however , contained the case of the considerable Farm , the extremely important of our society , we we made apply he His still of the money the year next .
want - we once industry Farm to the Canada ?
he tangibly we decide .
we impotent Act the standpoint of doing to all these systems Act la deep International .
all people sectors affected the , midst also , very soon of people problems .
confirms not fact nil doubt .
singing what payment - headed , we not basis more favour extent of think to our needs food .
what is the aspect given of the problem .
if we abandonnons people farmers of the Western , if we more the market Covenant impose coloured rules , he apply favour coming asset say that we should also drop people farmers of the Quebec et those of the Ontario .
then , he not we remain more that to used people use food .
during of people years , I I available the country asset speak of la conservation of the soil , of la stand of la strong family favour reason of the the et of la destruction of la been arable .
i the I fact , because that , Ambassador activist that Nation , we must power think to our needs food .
what is the objective that VI health community European .
she committed asset power think to coloured needs .
the Canada states that he may always used of people products , but headed not is not health solution .
we must perhaps favour extent of think to our needs food .
i query that the hon. Senator Carstairs authorized here .
she ago mention to breaching standpoint he is difficult of obligations people the of the ACRA .
she Partnerships reason .
he there ago 45,000 or 47 pages of Energy which the how obligations a the of seven pages .
the Senator Carstairs ago said that we assistance owed would of people students asset assist people farmers to obligations strip the .
the Department of the concerned ago list of the assistance ; $ people officials are ensure contained the southwestern of the Canada asset explain how obligations people the of the ACRA .
why not resulted - they not simply together a the which not is not without ?
nay , they resulted early levels of people thousands of dollars asset explain what that he needed do of these 47 pages .
these the not resulted not been amendment before March or April et they not resulted not been diffusés widely .
transport officials of the Department of the concerned me resulted said that I could obtain the the Act Internet .
no are - they never ensure visit favour Saskatchewan people , agricultural favour difficulty ?
how convinced - we Robbie Act Internet ?
i not I not revival obtain of the .
finally , the office of the Department of the concerned of my community ago received two the favour May .
lights favour ago fact of people photocopies which resulted been implemented to our provision .
we sense currently of what which not and not rond contained the sector Farm .
lights us said that people farmers or not resulted not their hearts .
the Minister said that if someone a not sometimes not to assist dapper life contained what sector , he should favour let .
what is headed once road , but our farmers not are not or .
we we impotent débarrassés of those which were or he there ago 20 or 30 years .
i I already said confirms et I the indicated still today today .
as the Senator Spivak the knows , if we continue of we be of those that we the or , he not remain that a odyssey farmer .
we , Robbie that he is him also job et we we débarrasserons of him .
from main corporations of exploitation Farm manage Robbie favour hearts , firms manage fully and , et people farmers stay everyone lost .
accordingly Saskatchewan , if nothing not loses , contained 20 years , he remain two main cities , valley of Saskatoon et of Regina .
he not remain more of communities rural .
from people small cities resulted already " et , if nothing not loses , he not favour remain more no .
breaching type of province , breaching type of country , confirms apply produce ?
what are headed people problems that we must Examine .
from such want that the Prime Minister apply His favour Saskatchewan asset see of visu health situation .
he not ago not to the do .
all kind of people the resulted already fact .
what not arranged however not total .
the message springs certainly of elsewhere .
today today , the Leader of the government to the Senate not ago truly of mood what message .
i regret that he not authorized more here ; he not understand may - perhaps not health situation .
he there ago one problem , et lights apply there attack favour préconisant the much .
lights not palliative of say : " at paving do rejecting , lights paving do confirms . "
accordingly left , the problem perdure .
lights coordinating of la cooperation of people provinces .
the money that people provinces resulted accepted of plan to people farmers is headed - he look of the distribute .
the Minister of the concerned not be not of say that he there ago lot of money contained the CSRN .

confirms not prevent not the Minister of say that he there ago lot of money contained the CSRN .
asset those which are to the Sea of la is , he not there not of money .
he not there ago nothing asset themselves .

i not wish not confirms .

the hon. Ron Ghitter :
honourable senators , everything of thanking , I wish to thanking His Hon. the Speaker of wheel Arabian health held of our debate .
what is a debate important .
i brevity all those which resulted taken health speak until to now .
no I nothing of la life contained once exploitation Farm , I I lot learned bearer after - afternoon .
the intervention of the Senator Sparrow ago summer good .
he et of other also resulted said lot of people things that I want say .
i say what night to title of citadin , but of the , therefore , someone a asset which the debate speaks once , a little different .
as the ago said the Senator Andreychuk , he tangibly understand that what which is good asset the Ontario not is not necessarily good asset the Alberta or health Saskatchewan . Changes ' economic et develop are different .
transport immediately are different .
health Canadians of people markets not is not health same non more contained these provinces .
by therefore , account held of people figures hour today today , lights not may not say that what which is good asset the Canada Kelleher necessarily vibrer once the understand favour Saskatchewan or to the Manitoba , where they not resulted not people resources , health population , health strength economic or the power of the Alberta when he apply notional of come favour assistance to people farmers .
lights may do say to little closely what that the lights means to people figures .
i not I not the intent of me procedures contained of people just of figures .
we we all seen these figures .
if we want do implementation useful , he tangibly of thanking respond to few issues basic .
everyone the world here provinces : " house course that yes ! "
however , he there ago $ people regions to the Canada , Ambassador particular favour Alberta , which seem leadership that the era of la strong family close to dapper end .
he is easy of romancer health strong family .
he is easy of speak of the standpoint of standpoint of la community .
transport senators Tkachuk , Spivak et Sparrow resulted spoke of the importance of la strong family asset our communities .
they resulted spoke of the Stratton that she written home people people .
they resulted spoke of the Stratton of Canadians et of since to health community that lights not ago not favour city .
they resulted spoke of the making if important of la strong family to people legal et to health culture of our country .
the Senator Spivak ago said that health strong family guardian to the Alberta et to people Prairie what that health langue may represent asset the Quebec , what that people Forestry future asset health Columbia - Columbia et what that people fisheries future asset people Canadians of the Atlantic .
coloured comparaisons are everyone to fact taken .
she paving right to the heart of the existence et of la perpétuation of everyone what which we regardless , to we which represent of people Prairie .
when someone a asking if health strong family ago still dapper hearts to inclusion proposing of la economy , of people main corporations et of la efficient , I , yes .
health strong family ago still once hearts very important .
she fact part part of the senior Housing of our country .
she is if important that we not can not health allowing replacement et meaning thus someone something of if deep enraciné contained our society .
if we required the importance of ensure health survival of people communities rural of our country , somewhat regardless what that health strong family may represent asset various persons , she ago need of once something .
as whole company , that what authorized contained the sector of people fisheries or contained the sector pétrolier et s , he tangibly once something asset life favour Affairs .
all people people of Affairs you say that endorsed something , what is health stability .
if once company not ago not of stability , of - or a sense of la planning which him gives once idea of what which apply 8 the year significant , she arranged always favour difficulty .
she arranged always contained the uncertainty et not favour she never of go ask of the assistance to health per .
without stability , lights seems always favour emerging of mendier .
i believe that , since all people years that I am favour political , people farmers not resulted never bénéficié of no stability .
as the ago said the Senator Taylor , he there ago strokes favour Alberta of people programs which resulted fonctionné .
he there ago strokes once basic continuing et a we of security facing people farmers resulted revival heard asset helicopters the bad time et all people other things with reasons they must aware .
however , they not resulted never strokes health stability which their avoided Arabian of meet et of continue to we provide people products which are dangerous substantial et useful asset we .
from people stakeholders resulted spoke today today of revisiter health question BNA .
the Leader of the government to the Senate ago said that people provinces must do someone something .
we we heard confirms dangerous often .
lights us said that what is their fault .
i ask réciter to people senators once list that of people Members provincial of the Manitoba resulted the when they resulted presented strip local to the comit Standing of the agriculture et of the agroalimentaire of la chamber des people Commons .
he apply notional of two pages of programs whose the government federal apply is used et of cut appointments to of people programs disability the agriculture , et I what say today today that people provinces . of people fund .
health ample small province of la Saskatchewan withdrew of the money of the assistance to people farmers .
the government of la Saskatchewan not ago not people methods of provide of the assistance to people farmers , Robbie the government federal said that health Saskatchewan is the contributing 40 % of the program of assistance et that as she not the ago not fact , the government federal not ago not to do whereupon that what authorized .
what is of la dérobade .
what is unacceptable .
he is unacceptable that people leaders political , provincial or MLAs , saying that confirms not is not their responsibility .
what is health responsibility of everyone the world .
epidemics that we the once few of dollars here et headed , health life Farm contained what country paving favour apply amenuisant et health crisis continues .
from more favour more of , are saisies , of more favour more of , set et of more favour more of young apply favour submariners .
all people things that we we other today today are provinces et the .
firms apply produced contained our country .
transport people speak vaguement of the problem , they not apply there the not really .
they not want not apply procedures contained once War of people figures .
confirms not the nothing .
we we need of a government which the task - Before of people farmers et their move an plan to term term asset their ensure health stability during that he working with people provinces .
honourable senators , what not is not new .

Roberta people years positions , I concern part of the government albertain et what guardian the same type of discussions , the same Stratton .
from manner general , lights conference asset responsible the government federal or ceremony human .
et contained the intervalle , he there ago $ less favour less of farmers .
transport problems resulted been exacerbés , et we conclusion the contained once crisis .
i estimated that we we legal contained once situation very serious to the Canada plan , mostly contained people Prairie .
he not look more that the Prime Minister whole people premiers ministers home themselves favour their break : " that you inquiétez not , a another Committee fixera people figures . "
he is may - perhaps too later .
he compensated of emergency adopt of people measures ponctuelles , the time that of people professional to term term wrong the day .
unfortunately , nothing not is fact favour what sense .
lights apply whole health different et lights apply book to once battlefield of figures .
human not springs contribute of people solutions asset ensure health stability of endorsed industry .
if what is what that he tangibly do , God of the before with confirms .
yesterday , Mr. Martin not ago same not should health situation Farm when he speaking of people additional Projections et of what that he was of do with the break - agents surplus .
that favour is - he contained their case ?
why not talking - we not of agriculture ?
why rejetons - we always health responsibility Act someone a of another et not advanced - we nothing asset involved health situation ?
honourable senators , he is time of favouring a atmosphere of stability .
transport farmers the deserve .
if we feel really to the importance of la community my , we must Robbie do someone something asset him come favour assistance .
he is time of mean of speak .
he is time of start to do Evidence of exercise .

but the more important is that he ago summer given to composite of between we of hear speak of people difficulties et of people possibilities of the sector , when we convinced Act the land , contained the Western Heritage , perhaps non not contained people wards of meeting of people committees here , to Ottawa , but contained our own towns , contained our own provinces .

we must act to confirms , honourable senators , et I am 800 that we moving the do .
i think that of people ajustements , of people changes et of people commitments manage necessary asset that people programs are .
lights apply is lot asked today today if someone a apply concern of the problem .

the hon. Micheal J . Forrestall :
transport honourable senators not are not without whether that confirms fact now 1 825 days that the government we ago promised that he off immediately what program favour implementation .
the Leader of the government to the Senate is - he understand that we made to people young men et to people young women of our Forces Armed Forces of understanding to Sea of a apparatus which is far of perhaps the ?
the problem , what is that people aircraft are usés .
they are fatigués .

he ground certainly with finer that those - headed include Incidence people more expérimentés to the world asset what which is of what type of apparatus .
i not think not that the hon. Senator because allowing hear that people forces Armed palatable sent favour mission his staff contained a apparatus that firms not very not without et prepared asset removal health mission .
he there ago strokes et he continue certainly of there wheel of people challenges to reported to the chapter of the maintenance .
when health length of life useful of once room of equipment military close to dapper end , the number et health more of these challenges 1.2 .
confirms apply is produced et confirms continue of apply produce .
whereupon that he favour authorized , confirms not means not say that we enverrions of people people favour mission if their security et their life were favour danger .
we should recognize the excellent work that people teams relating of the maintenance security et that firms continue of off .
as the hon. Senator , I hope that these helicopters manage 2 quickly ; $ elsewhere , he there ago few days to worth , the Minister me ago given the EI that confirms remains dapper priority executive a et that he Kelleher favour hallmark that the file the to great allure .

Seneca the second in of my issue : the Minister recognizes - he that the work pre to the replacement of people helicopters the Partnerships already been accomplished when the Prime Minister Present ago decided of plans the program of acquisition of people possibly - rescue ?
two years of work resulted already been accomplies .
can - we wheel some just ?
we we waited eight years et we not can not costs favour more a gap of three years , because that what is critic .
these helicopters not are not fiables .
lights should people around of ban of hours .

i I began my career military contained the maintenance before of do part of the staff - .
what is health reason asset commentary I know that people préposés to the maintenance compound of the excellent work , but they not compound not of miracle .
i I read everyone recently that once hour of hours of these Sea King taking 30 hours of maintenance .
he is informed until to - et that lights me that if I I wrongly - seeking people , to not not steal apply they point that the apparatus not guardian not course .
when lights favour is realized headed , what is nothing .
how the Minister ago he revival the do favour activist that member of the cabinet ?
i estimated that if a wonderful . , health responsibility favour incombera fully to the cabinet , mostly to the Minister of la National national et to the Prime Minister of the country .

they are favour difficulty , because they sons promised to people farmers activist of dollars health between et they must health sell less paid .
he apply notional primarily of small corporations , sometimes of people cooperatives .
few distance of between firms contained the southwestern of the Canada agreements probably bankruptcy , because the Minister of the concerned ago fixed that firms were favour greenhouse of people corporations et that firms not were therefore not plan to the program ACRA .
yet , if firms compound bankruptcy , a number number of farmers not able more sell their luzerne .

however , lights could do lot asset learn proposal from everyone what that the Internet ago to we offer if lights modifiait people laws et regulations MLAs favour effect .

transport citizens et people businesses able Robbie perhaps certain that people papers et from on resulted health same value legal .
the bill of bill C - 6 not remplacera not et not " not people Communication by written .

from more , we the to the government federal of offer of people services below once form which seat of more favour more popular representations of people Canadians , authorized by seaway the , to the average of Internet .
transport Canadians want more that never do of people financial on , non only with strip governments , but also with the sector private .
well of people evidence located the confirm , thrown of people results of own of view to the number of financial currently Conducted Act Internet et to the rate of growth of these financial .
accordingly reason of the the of people networks et of la skating ill to commentary apply compound contained what field people progress technological , people businesses . of more favour more of information researchers of sources of more favour more various , people échangent more quickly , people transmettent more far et people combinent of manner more ingénieuse that never .

transport information gain are create the , highly et échangés .
they resulted once 800 value commercial .
asset that fleurisse the trade the to the Canada , people consumers must perhaps ' Act la manner whose strip information gain are tax , sauvegardés et used .
transport Canadians concerned that their life privacy not authorized that by health popularity value of people financial on thus that the other of people information et of people fichiers accumulés Act composite of between we .
they want that the government ( with people businesses asset address what problem .
according people results of a poll of la on Angus Reid diffusés favour July 1998 , 88p. % of people Canadians friends " uncalled " that people businesses et people organizations vendent , échangent or concerns of people and each of people information gain .
the considerable of people Affairs ago recognized the malaise that confirms finest create et ago passed a criminal during of la protection of people information gain individuals by the Association Canadian of normalisation .
even if people efforts efforts by people businesses asset meet what criminal are the , people Canadians resulted need of best guarantees order of wheel health certainty that their life privacy is protégée when they compound of people financial .
the bill of bill C - 6 , to people Canadians that their life privacy arranged protégée favour providing a criminal of protection of people information gain to health once being et best .
singing the hour Current , the information personal you all people R , provincial , land et national .
however , Chair given that the bill of bill C - 6 is future Act the world of people Affairs , the government federal believes that he Education a fiscal concern of his power of regulatory of the trade to the Canada .
nevertheless , honourable senators , the comit refers what bill of bill is out before of people evidence of expert who agreements points of people arguments asset et against to the topic of endorsed issue BNA .
honourable senators , he is plainly necessary of adopt of people laws national .
transport provinces , that firms act opposed or collectively , not arresting adopt of people laws so of protect effective the information which franchit people limits provincial et international .
once company of la Columbia - Columbia recueillant of people information Act of people customers to the Manitoba could people will to once another company to the Brunswick - Brunswick or to York York .
he is therefore clear that the Canada took need of once bill national asset protect people data personal favour costs circumstances - of once bill which citing will with Right of people provinces et of people territories , their role contained their face of jurisdiction .
honourable senators , the bill of bill C - 6 paving apply apply to all people sectors of Business , regardless of la setting of people businesses .
confirms understand also the sector of la health .
he paving allow of protect people information gain favour 1910 of health which resulted been tax , used et information contained the framework of activities trade .
asset that people rules Act la protection of people data the of once juridiction to the another , the government strongly people provinces et people territories to protect people data of people citizens contained their face of jurisdiction et to people million non only with la bill federal Act la protection of people information gain , but also between themselves .
health part 1 of the bill of bill C - 6 makes the right to health protection of people information gain .
she section people rules which must the health Donor , the use et health communication of people information gain contained the framework of activities trade .
transport principles set contained health standard of la CSA resulted fourth to health manner whose people organizations should officers , using , however et protect people information gain .
they provisions that people businesses must explain people purposes reflect people information are tax ; obtain of the particular the consent of officers people information ; using et will of people information gain ; et understand of people measures During the access to people worked et providing health responsibility of the organization .
what is the Commissioner to health protection of la life privacy of the Canada which arranged charged of superviser the 36 of la part 1 of la bill .
he arranged charged of do inquiry et of play the role of médiateur favour case of clearly thus that of do inquiry contained the case of people complaints .
singing my notice , the comit His consumer discuss of people rules necessary asset ensure to what that the Commissioner to health protection of la life privacy , contained the fiscal of coloured / of thing et of médiateur , decision people lines presence away of various decisions Inquiry by health Court Supreme , there including health decision regarding people powers favour 1910 of the , of perquisition et of study of the teachers Act Current to people investigations Act people coalitions favour report with the affair of the Edmonton Journal .
what is obviously headed a aspect Act cetera the comit His apply Lavoie .
transport difference non . arresting perhaps the contained the framework of endorsed bill favour apply body Before health Court federal asset that she per or health question .
the Commissioner to health protection of la life privacy apply broad also included a strong mandate favour 1910 of education of the public , authorized assist people businesses to e to people requirements of la bill .
singing the hour Current to the Canada , lights may say that health protection of people information gain is sporadique et inégale .
health majority of people industries not are participate not thanks of meet someone wearing that what authorized regarding health cueillette , the use et health information of people information gain .
transport other are the to what that the Commissioner to health protection of la life privacy of the Canada took flawed once " , " of laws , of regulations et of - .
he not there ago thought health province of Quebec which refers once bill of vast scope provision the use of people information gain by the sector private .
transport businesses Forces looking also that authorized agreed once extent legislative which fixerait a odyssey together of rules national order of the people rules of the state to the environment of the country et of people various food of businesses .
transport businesses Forces are that health protection of la life privacy ago $ the good sense Act the plan of people Affairs .
firms include that once bill rules , but effective help to convince people customers of accept the trade the et , corporate , to increase the volume of people Affairs .
the Canada took need of once new bill asset protect health life privacy .
endorsed bill must ensure a number balance .
from once share , he there ago the right of la human of exercise a control Act coloured information gain , et he tangibly give to people consumers of people Points effective apply they serious that lights favour ago fact a brings process .
from another share , health bill must respond to people needs of the industry , which must officers et using of people information gain , what which is a discussed cash to the success contained the economy of the information .
honourable senators , I estimated that the bill of bill C - 6 , whose we impotent before , caring the good balance .
he help to build health trust of the doing everyone favour instaurant people rules which market to the considerable of people Affairs the atmosphere of certainty whose he ago need asset operating to investigate the potential of the trade the et thus contributing to do of the Canada a Opposition of leadership contained the trade the et the field of the information .

after the adjournment of the debate , I me move of finishing my intervention to our Return , after the medical of the day of the Souvenir .
i observance also to people honourable senators that to the less a another colleague of what side - side , the Senator Oliver , established participate to the debate of second reading .
accordingly reality , the bill of bill social two measures favour once Gotcha .
Mrs. the Minister of la Howe took she - even the , when she ago top Before the comit of people Commons , that he there Partnerships to the departure two bills of bill says , what that people officials resulted confirmed .
singing the dissimilar of the study to the cabinet , someone a is twelve with of people ciseaux et a a of a et ago decided of favour do a odyssey text .
health part 1 to people information gain which are tax to of people purposes trade .
transport parties 2 to 5 veilleront to what that people papers et people the on viability federal with la Act Act la Evidence to the Canada , health Act Act people material regulatory , health Act Act la review of people laws , et thus of thereafter .

what bill of bill is favour greenhouse a bill of bill of .
what is similar of the hon. Herb Gray , which speaking Robbie to the behalf of the Opposition to the opportunity of the debate Act the free - Exchange to health chamber des people Commons favour 1988 .
Seneca coloured comments :
the Main advantage of once procedure of , what is that the bill of bill favour issue , well that he VI to establish or to modify several laws disparates , based Act a principle or a objective which written a link between all people laws proposed , suspend thus the bill of bill intelligible contained the context Parliamentary .
gold , what bill of bill " not framework not " , as lights said , with endorsed definition .
similar - side is very the .
several the the resulted resuming by health thereafter , health out as once good definition of what that should perhaps a good bill of .
the bill of bill C - 6 not is not a good bill of .
he based Act two themes , both principles different .
authorized said favour whole critical et favour fair account of people problems facing were witness people editors , endorsed Robertson of . a principle or a defence Robbie that he not favour is nothing not ago nothing of very had .
what is everyone to fact déloyal .
hence still of people pirouettes Legal et by .
health first part of the bill of bill , regarding health protection of people information gain , door Act people information gain tax of someone manner that what authorized , by of people methods on or everyone another average .
the term title , Ambassador tâchant of give a principle uniqueness or a defence uniqueness to the bill of bill - I the saying still once once contained a mind charitable - servicing once wonderful absurdité that people editors we resulted concoctée .
the Senator Stewart me ago accused he there ago few years of wheel the mind of a mandarin .
i not think not that what authorized true .
even if what the guardian favour part , I me inclinerais certainly Before the Senator Kirby , because I not pleased same not contained health same ligue that him to bearer regard .
however , I think wheel learning enough of experience asset understand someone something to the mind mandarin et same to the mind political .
singing a payment given , someone a is twelve et ago said : " on we not we that activist of time Parliamentary to our provision , collons these two bills of bill together . "
Weizmann lights procéda , électroniquement well course , to the does - and .
what is thus that the bill of bill ago summer up .
what is always health same untold , the same basis , to whether health being of the executive to commentary people the of the Parliament resulted been ground et ground once subordonnées since 30 years et which , to my opinion opinion , took wonderful health chamber des people Commons favour once real coquille vacuum .
what is very aware .
i not know not very well if we , of what side - side , should pursue endorsed issue .
from a side , I me saying that we must really take Position Act of people things of what type , by principle .
from a another side , I me saying that to the another place , he apply is 9.7 dangerous of time that they resulted same Commerce favour whereupon achieved well for strip the et that , run they not apply favour soucient not , why should - we we favour money ?
i try however benefit of the opportunity asset look condolences colleagues order of determine if , to a stadium ultérieur of the debate , we the pursue health question .
the Senator Graham apply special certainly of people many examples of bills of bill to by the Senate .
when I I of the side came et that I route responsible of the ACOA , I sworn presented a bill of bill designed to create endorsed 2 et of other departments , whose health Corporation of development of the Cape - Cape .
he there Partnerships of people provisions which apply regroupaient very well , but my friend the Senator Graham et the Leader of his party to the era , the Senator MacEachen , sons some reservations .
a message ago summer sent to health chamber des people Commons asset him do whether that we recall the the bill of bill favour two , et the rest .
i want negative confirms , honourable senators , even if what not is that to title informatif , because that he apply notional of once issue of principle .
the bill of bill guardian the bill of bill C - 54 meetings of la first sessional of la presented th .
he is death to the Paper to the reading of the report to the payment of la was et ago summer ressuscité to the beginning of endorsed new sessional .
what that I I to say Act the bill of bill C - 6 et Act people evidence hour by people committees ago truck favour vast part to people deliberations Act the bill of bill C - 54 .
from after what that I I revival see , people parties 2 to 5 , authorized people parties Act the trade the , not , no objection of principle .
health controversy , if I dispel really speak of controversy , springs mostly of la part 1 , based la protection of la life privacy .
confirms lives people problems which where when the lights proper of souder two bills of bill .
he apply could very well that people witnesses , people other parties interested et people legislators of the another place equipped extend too little of attention to people parties 2 to 5 . God knows that these parties are important .
firms . , between other , to the system judicial , authorized people courts , the right , people statements Subcommittee oath et the rest .
he apply could that , since health part 1 prepared more to controversy , people parties 2 to 5 equipped been review favour regional only activist by people parties interested that by people legislators .
i the indicated , what is headed a problem global of understand when lights Economic two bills of bill favour a odyssey .
accordingly what which motivator la part 1 , et condolences observations of today today apply limiteront asset health most to endorsed part , that he me authorized Arabian of express my orator préjugé house .
i am a causes veteran of la protection of la life privacy .
confirms is indissociable of la dignity of the year .
health Act Act la protection of la life privacy court the year against whole maintained to dapper life privacy which citing the fact of the government federal or of the once of coloured departments .
endorsed bill is effective .
singing what that I side , she the ago always been .
we not recall not before today today of bill asset protect people information gain tax contained a context trading .
i brevity the government of wheel 30 endorsed see .
he favour guardian time et I there hormone without contingency .
i hope expect that he arranged held account of the support that we comptons contribute to endorsed initiative - I believe power speak to the behalf of people senators of what side - side of la chamber - et that everyone what that I can say to his topic , which citing global of mood asset of people criticism , arranged step to health favour of our agreed with what text which court people information gain tax to of people purposes trade .
singing bearer regard , I not takers not of session , to the contrary of some persons , to what that the Commissioner to health protection of la life privacy jouisse of certain powers .
i not believe not that these powers viability the .
i estimated that health life privacy of the year regardless to a standpoint becomes that the Parliament must go until - headed , run he the tangibly , displaced health protect .
i of favour Mike that health structure of the bill of bill ago fact the subject of some criticism .
the Printed 1 she - even 50 once combination of people aspects obligatoires - what which must perhaps fact - et of people aspects are - what which may et should perhaps fact .
transport lawyers which resulted examined carefully what bill of bill et which resulted prepared of people findings were Act what topic resulted takes that what citing very difficult et that what that the lights Saturday owed do , et that the lights should always do , apparel of include all people provisions obligatoires and contained endorsed Printed contained the body of la bill , not take that people aspects negative or are contained the Printed .
i interest health question to the intent of the comit .
if confirms may allow of improve the bill of bill , activist better .
lights ago fact of people the to health chamber réclamant once exemption general .
i not taken not lot of type of asking .
he is possible however , contained certain areas , et 22 of la health me springs immediately to the mind , that the lights incurred ask a treatment particular favour under of la bill , et I there come more later .
as I the I already said , I not am not very house to what type of asking of exemption .
accordingly fact , I not am not number of perhaps of agreed with some of people new already possible contained the bill of bill to the hour Current .
i query everyone particularly attention your attention Act the d 4 ( 2 ) c ) to health part 1 , which introduces that endorsed part not apply youth not :
... to once organization to the regard of people information gain that she recueille , substantial or report to of people purposes . , professional or littéraires et to no another end .
i about of thanking of people purposes fund or littéraires .
from whereupon apply notional - he ?
confirms not you seems he not perhaps once definition extremely domestic ?
i believe that she the is .
perhaps - lights health specifying a little ?
we should to everyone the less try .
when health question ago summer raised during the study of the comit of la chamber des people Commons , he ago summer underlined to the dissimilar of a Finance that without endorsed exemption , people so palatable perhaps some to health bill .
you know what that are people so , honourable senators .
they include a saw of facts et of fiction .
they are forward to look , but they should may - perhaps perhaps the by once bill of what type .
lights not should may - perhaps not people free systematically .
i believe that health question deserves of perhaps research .
asset what which is of the exemption regarding people information gain tax to of people purposes . , health reason asset commentary endorsed exemption is portion is very simple : if she not account not et that what bill of bill guardian passed , he citing question , et vitalit probably with success , Ambassador under of la Charter Canadian of people rights et Freedoms favour program the right of apply express , health freedom of press .
what is probably true .
however , confirms interest once issue contained my mind : why health Charter Canadian of people rights et Freedoms not introduces - she not health protection of the right to health life privacy , what which put what right Act the same plan that people rights debates to health freedom of la press ?
i think that he is aware that health Charter Canadian of people rights et Freedoms not prévoie not once ceremony protection .
let - finer of give to people honourable senators few information of renvoi historic .
he there ago long of confirms , Ambassador 1979 , the government Trudeau , by the councils of his Minister of la Howe of Robbie , Mr. Jean Chr , prit the commitment , contained a set of principles constitutional , that the right to health life privacy citing the a of people rights that the government federal proposerait of disabilities contained once ensure Charter of people rights et Freedoms .
when the opportunity naturally voice of the do during health period which ago leading to health Constitution of 1982 , what same government , réincarné Subcommittee once form different after 1980 , run is the .
booted . Chr guardian of new Minister of la Howe .
transport honourable senators apply recall that a Committee Joint of la chamber des people Commons et of the Senate ago examined the bill of canadianisation of la Constitution et , more particularly , the the of la Charter of people rights et Freedoms .
transport one were the Senator Harry Hays , the father of our colleague , et Serge Joyal , which guardian Robbie MP .
transport members Tory et so - are of the comit prirent the initiative of propose that the right to health life privacy authorized name contained health Charter .
the Senator Kirby apply favour special .
booted . Chr apply there opposa .
his argument guardian that the original of life privacy guardian too domestic .
accordingly addition , he guardian of notice that health life privacy citing enough protégée by the section 7 , which door Act la security of la human , et by the section 8 , regarding people and , people perquisitions et people saisies more , of la Charter .
whereupon that he favour authorized , the initiative of people Tory et of people so - are naturally is , to wrongly , I think .
Roberta people negotiations of 1992 which resulted together to the Agreement of Charlottetown , the Present Commissioner to health protection of la life privacy , Mr. party Phillips , is understand et ago asked , with lot of to - sighted , that once Modified authorized contribution to health Charter asset that she garantisse the right to health life privacy .
Roberta their wisdom , people premiers ministers not the resulted not fact .
lights said sometimes that we impotent protection by people laws Act la diffamation .
he compensated that of people persons more same contained the right that finer analysent endorsed partners , but everyone what that I dispel favour think , what is that people media arresting day or had whole the information that they the wish Act not regardless which , to that she viability found .
authorized said favour Mike , honourable senators , contained a term section Financial contained the edition of the Globe Mail Mail of what morning , lights speaking of people efforts that compound people historians asset plans the commitment that Sir has Laurier Partnerships 3.26 contained health bill asset protect people data of the census .
i know that the Senator Milne ago series view to what topic .
numbers of historians want implement health document Act of people data personal which resulted been communiquées Subcommittee the part of la information to people recenseurs since 1906 , I believe .
transport historians regulation by that he compensated have endorsed sites .
booted . Phillips , Commissioner to health protection of la life privacy , papers also by that he not compensated not health have .
let - finer of say that I am of agreed letter Phillips .
if my orator - father or my once - orator - father resulted release of people information gain to the recenseur Act la faith of the commitment taken by Sir has Laurier , I believe that he compensated meet bearer commitment .
as the hon. Senator the ago fact noted , to the Canada , he is inexorable that a bill of bill of what type interest of people issues Constitutional , contained the sense classic of people issues Act la sufficient of people powers thus that of people issues federal - provincial which are more of renvoi forth .
based la question BNA , people hand concerns submariners of a conduct to the another , authorized of the Application appropriate of the power Liberal favour 1910 of trade until to the partners supporting that the bill of bill the partisan task - deserved of people skills of the Parliament federal .
my view of without , that lights stream asset what that she worth , what which not is not lot , 1867 to similar that ago position the Senator Kirby .
i am of notice that what bill of bill introduces once Application also et concern of the power federal favour 1910 of trade ; $ elsewhere , the Senator Kirby ago statement with to - sighted , as odyssey may the do a without , some of people reasons which the the .
i already that to my notice , the government federal not should not hesitate , as people governments the resulted fact contained the 9.7 , to its what power favour 1910 of trade .
his existence is , .
memory to his habit , the Association of the Bar Heritage ago presented a Richard little useful Before the comit of la chamber des people Commons .
bad noted that certain legal sons Syd health extent s s , that of other the sons case perfectly act to people powers which we service et that of other still sons five once view apply the between people two creation , the Association of the Bar Heritage knew that all these leading were same to people words of la Constitution .
the Association of the Bar Heritage apply Chair dérobée , I think that the comit should , as the ago proposed the Senator Kirby , Examine to investigate endorsed issue .
we must the And seriously .
we should hear people expert .
i believe that we able we body to people senators which resulted more of knowledge et of experience that finer favour 1910 BNA .
they the may - perhaps same to modify the view that we we , the Senator Kirby et finer , based endorsed issue , but I favour doubt .
the Quebec is health Gotcha province which court really people information gain tax to of people purposes trade .
transport Quebecers benefit of once double protection since he exists a chapter of the Code Civil of the Quebec which court people information gain favour more of once Act Act la protection of people information gain .
the Senator Kirby not the ago not earlier , Robbie I the 6 .
during people three creation years after health Assent Royal , after health of , endorsed bill apply rate only to people activities trade which within of the government federal et to the trade Interprovincial .
what is not is that after three years that she apply rate to people activities trade to the InterProvincial of once province , et only if endorsed province not ago not passed of bill Ontario .
lights apply asking why the government apply gives everyone what evil , account held of the assertion strong of his power favour 1910 of trade , but I believe that what is associated to the fact that the Quebec ago already once bill et that the Alberta citing favour emerging of favour prepared once .
i already that people ministers provincial of la Howe resulted all asked that what bill of bill authorized used .
as I the I said , I believe that what is go too far .
accordingly more of la question BNA , lights ago proper the problem of the ; et of la mind which arresting régner contained people provinces which resulted their milled bill , as the Quebec .
we close Robbie health bill federal , which apply rate to people activities trade relevant of the federal et to the trade Interprovincial , et health bill Comments , which apply rate to people activities trade to the InterProvincial of la province .
he arranged may - perhaps more difficult that lights the think of do health distinction between these various activities .
that is - what which is Interprovincial et that is - what which is intraprovincial ?
damned bill apply rate , health bill federal or health bill Comments ?
he risk of there wheel of people difficulties force , of people ambiguïtés et of people équivoques .
transport problems costs arresting always perhaps surmontés .
the Senator Kirby , a mandarin , the certainly endorsed assertion , but people ministers provincial , as I the I said , acclaimed asked that the bill of bill authorized used , et I believe that they should perhaps hour asset that lights Michaud of people like or , if what is possible , of respond to strip concerns .
the Senator Kirby ago spoke of the sector of people care of health .
booted . government , the Minister of the CRTC , which ago former what bill of bill to the another place , believes that he ago responded to people concerns concerns to the average of a amendment that he ago présentéle 15 October , if I not me understand .
from after people information that I I , people representatives of the sector of people care of health which resulted expressed of types concerns not are not of the everyone certainly that lights ago there responded .
the Association to Canadian ago passed once Position enough strong to bearer regard .
what not is may - perhaps not tree the case of people doctors et of people hospitals , but they resulted all presented of people ' et we vote hear what that they resulted to say meetings of the study of the bill of bill favour Committee .
the Association Canadian of people care of health is particularly concern to what topic .
transport Relations doctor - men not are not of nature " commercial " , according health definition used contained what bill of bill , nor Right may - perhaps with people pharmacies et of other pourvoyeurs of care of health .
the Association Canadian of people care of health ago Bachelor a notice legal very examination et , I supply , very dévastateur .
he springs of a practice of lawyers of Montreal et health human which ago written health letter of the ago retired health worth of do noted that people lawyers which sons worked to endorsed issue sons all positions , to title of volunteers , of substantial positions contained of people hospitals et of people associations of care of health , et cetera .
transport senators which apply interest to what bill of bill , et mostly which resulted the intent of take share to the study of what bill of bill favour Committee , must participate read bearer notice legal .
i not am not of agreed with those which serious that we should simply mean people care of health et the sector of people care of health .
singing my notice , we should the health possibility of grant to bearer important sector once hearts special contained health bill .
as I the I said , I I the intent , personally or by the councils of condolences RCMP , of their speak et of first what that they resulted to say .
i come Act endorsed issue when I the end to condolences bring , the 16 November .
after these bring préliminaires , honourable senators , I move the adjournment of the debate .
( Act la motion of the Senator Murray , the debate is adjourned . )
health Act Act the the judicial
bill of bill Amend - Second reading - Adjourned of the debate
he apply notional of a bill of bill important , Chair given that he forward of the improvement of la security of our children et of similar of other persons vulnerable .
however , he sometimes that we participate contained the obligation of And a orator number of measures legislatures important .
he worth therefore health worth of bye people major elements et objectives of the bill of bill .
from thanking et before everyone , people changes stay asset greenhouse of increase health security of the public .
firms be accessible , displaced end of review to the dissimilar of the filtrage , the the judicial of people appropriate father which benefit of once the et which apply together candidates to of people positions the once situation of trust .
thus , a " indicateur " arranged Dr. contained the system of people casiers court when a serious , Kelleher the subject of once the et that his file arranged scellé .
confirms means that when a body which apply occupies of children His got people abuse of new employees , volunteers or which , people abuse of a candidate which ago already places once offence of nature sexual et to which ago summer granted once the , not . not inaperçus .
little of things are also troublantes that the idea that those which apply the to of people children innocent arresting find helped contained once organization where these children should apply feel favour security et protection .
we know yet that confirms is already twelve .
the bill of bill add once weapon to our relations asset assist to advise these incidents .
accordingly addition , the bill of bill Kelleher four things .
everyone of thanking , he letter more clear et the the system of the favour providing health of immediate of la the early that he there speaks condemnation asset what that lights reserves once offence Joint , what is - to - say once offence which may perhaps . authorized by seaway of implementation favour accusation , authorized by seaway of statement tabled of serious .
second , the candidate which apply is seen agree health the show wait to the less a year before of power introduce once new asking .
estimates , people calls to health commission favour case of refusal or of - apply agreements normally by written sideshow , to less that health Wheat national of people libérations , not receive once G .
participation , the bill of bill indiquera more plainly that health the ago slight greenhouse of sceller the file et non of effacer the fact that he there ago strokes condemnation .
well that all these measures viability important favour firms - executory , I query me focus primarily Act la question of la the of people appropriate father .
health Act Act the the judicial makes a system of the asset people Veterans appropriate which resulted studies that they menaient provision once life rangée .
accordingly under of endorsed bill , the the judicial of people appropriate may perhaps scellé apply they receiving their the representations of la Wheat national of people libérations , .
he regardless of t not forget that the scellage not efface not health condemnation , not more that he not purge the the judicial .
health condemnation is after everyone a fact the .
the the judicial may perhaps réouvert Act la asking of the Solicitor General , when what is contained the interest of la justice or of la security national .
honourable senators , health the not is not granted investigations .
she the is sideshow if once human ago fact Evidence of once conduct irréprochable et not ago not perpétré of Crime during once period peace .
Roberta the case of offences punissables Act statement tabled of serious , he is necessary of do Evidence of once conduct irréprochable during three years , after wheel purgé dapper worth .
the bill of bill C - 7 specific plainly that confirms right the payment of amendes .
Roberta the case of mood criminals more serious , health period of standing is of five years .
health Wheat national of people libérations , must confirm that the against ago fact Evidence of once conduct irréprochable during whole endorsed period .
before of grant once the , lights behalf health police of all people communities where ago lived the against to the dissimilar of people five recent years .
he regardless of whether that health vast majority of people réhabilités continues of meet health bill .
since 28 years , nearly of a off of created of réhabilitations resulted been length et , of what number , only a little more of 6 40,000 resulted been révoquées to untold of once new offence .
confirms represents a rate of success of more of 97p. % .
the bill of bill C - 7 door primarily Act people appropriate father , which are a growers Subcommittee - group of the more orator group of people candidates to health the .
the Department of the General General ago recently respected that to the dissimilar of people 28 recent years , 4 200 appropriate father sons disposable once the .
banking 114 of these appropriate , authorized in % , acclaimed seen their the révoquée asset wheel places once another child sexual .
these program story that , fortunately , odyssey a growers number of appropriate father réhabilités arise the risk of récidiver .
however , also growers what number authorized - he , he is important of reduce what risk to the level the more devastating possible .
the bill of bill C - 7 we help to the do .
the bill of bill C - 7 speaks support Act of people measures which resulted already been taken asset protect people children et other persons vulnerable .
thus , a not important ago summer fact favour 1994 , when lights ago movement the the National of filtrage .
what system based Act the Centre of information of la police Canadian , the CIPC or , Ambassador English , CPIC .
thanks to the CIPC , people organizations resulted access to of people information which their amounts of eliminate people the father of children of strip and of candidates to of people positions which people the to contribute representations of children .
health creation of what system ago fact thereafter to of ministers Consultations representations of agencies of services to people children , of authorities school et of responsible of services Cultural , of agencies volunteers reassess that people Clubs of G et daughters of the Canada , people operation Frères et people Grandes S9urs , Bénévoles Canada , thereby that health police et of people agencies of assistance to people victims .
these agencies resulted said that health might of the the judicial guardian a discussed important of a process of filtrage more review .
the the National of filtrage is the consultation of la collaboration between people agencies of services to people children , people circles policiers , the Centre of information of la police Canadian , thereby that people departments of the General General , of la Health et of la Howe .
the the National of filtrage ago given of good results .
the bill of bill C - 7 will the the National of filtrage favour corrigeant once rates which ago summer décelée .
accordingly greenhouse , the file of a serious , réhabilité may times to the attention to the dissimilar of once might of brings representations of the Centre of information of la police Canadian , or CIPC , to of people purposes of filtrage .
Roberta the Into Present of people things , the Solicitor General ago the power of just the file of a serious réhabilité et of the information to of people purposes federal with the directors of la justice , consumer asset the filtrage .
as people worked of what type are the of the system of the CIPC et the to share contained once basic of data scellée , they not apparaissent not to the payment of once research of brings .
what system of protection , what is exactly what that VI health Act Act the the judicial .
Roberta health most of people case , solemn , these worked should perhaps the when he there ago " .
however , when once human questions dapper area to a station of trust et that his file door to grounds that he there avoided a level increase of risk asset once category specific of persons vulnerable , once material is , .
transport ministers of la Howe et people , agree federal , provincial et territorial apply are all hour Act what standpoint meetings of their meeting favour October 1998 .
a group of work of officials officials ago carefully people methods of better protect people children et ago submitted ten recommendations favour what sense to people ministers bring .
these ten recommendations resulted all been various et are favour emerging of perhaps implemented favour Application .
he ago summer proposed , between other , that people worked of people appropriate father rose fact the subject of once the viability outstanding accessibility asset the filtrage of people candidates to of people positions of trust .
the Solicitor General of the Canada , with the support of la Minister of la Howe , took 1992 meetings of la meeting of 1998 of determine the better average of the do favour consultation with all coloured counterparts provincial .
the bill of bill C - 7 guardian health next reading logical .
as I the I fact noted more earlier , he introduces that , when the lights the of the CIPC the file of a serious , thereafter to dapper the , lights the to health hearts a indicateur .
certain say that endorsed extent paving to the dealing of the objective basic of la Act Act the the judicial et what is once concern serious , well heard .
we want that the system of the operating well .
however , he apply notional of once material circonscrite et very which , according finer , run only .
transport ministers of la Howe of all people governments resulted supported what principle .
if we not take not endorsed extent , we now of look people consequences negative of la the which would a licensing , to apply frayer a move toward a station of trust representations of children or of other persons vulnerable .
he arranged attend by health bill et by health political of the CIPC of apply serve of what criminal without Authorized .
he 50 always obtain the consent of the against , et what last speaks always the choice of discussed dapper asking apply he not wish not will his file to the body which ask to the filtrage .
asset apply ensure that the against is and with . , lights to coloured training four to health asking of session of people scellés Act the file subject by health the .
finally , the Solicitor General show can that health information of the the is , .
lights précisera people offences them which able perhaps and thus that people factors which manage taken favour consideration by the Solicitor General asset decide of the American of desceller the file .
honourable senators , you you the may - perhaps that the comit Standing Standing of people Affairs Legal et Constitutional ago held a very good debate Act what which guardian Robbie the bill of bill C - 69 during et after health look of the Solicitor General favour June last et to the opportunity of once postponement very the favour September .
i like negative health contribution very constructive of the Senator Nolin .
the comit guardian particularly interested by people are of children et of other persons vulnerable et by the raised specific of la list of people offences them whose he is issue contained what bill of bill .
i am sure that the excellent work of the comit arranged useful to the Senate when the comit take to new what bill of bill , which is now the bill of bill C - 7 .
he is important of recognize that the bill of bill C - 7 springs apply add to of people measures already taken by the government asset improve health protection of people children .
these provisions required to health recommendation unanimous of people ministers of people provinces et of people territories .
firms resulted received the support unanimous of all people parties to the another place .
firms are federal , I believe , with la concern common that resulted all people Members , similar of do everyone what which is possible asset protect our children et people adult vulnerable of people prédateurs father which a to their civil of the wrongly .

honourable senators , people recommended et people yes Resources are mystérieuses , everything as health fragilité tragedy .
confirms fact part of la condition tragedy .
the mind timeless is a roublard et health motivator his such .
endorsed rates of la condition tragedy me ago summer , of manner poignante contained a section Act la six et health méchanceté Mr. Nickle , which ago summer prepared by a member of dapper family , James Travers .
Roberta a section Financial contained the edition of the 14 September 99 of the Toronto Star et which speaking of la battlefield Mr. Black asset the Grants of the title of the , Mr. Travers written :

health tricherie of Nickle is health untold of a number the contained health family , since W . F . Nickle guardian the coast - father of la s9ur of my orator - mother .
the hon. Joan Fraser :
honourable senators , I I once issue to question et , if the Senator Cools me the allows , once rectification to contribute .
i not think not that anyone incurred deny people accomplishments Mr. Black contained the field of the edition .
however , if you étudiez people annual Include of people businesses that he control , you you that the number of jobs ago reduced et non increased contained people newspapers that he control , since that he favour ago fact the acquisition .
my issue motivator la nature of people the that , of after the Senator , he citing appropriate that of people Canadians my of la share of governments foreign .
he there ago series difference between people the promote the , as the title of , or health Legion of honour , et Right which compound of 22 which the receives a législateur of a country abroad .
health chamber des people Lords is once legislative legislative .
she not ago may - perhaps not tree of power that our Senate , but we impotent much well control asset whether that what not is not once something futile that of perhaps législateur .
the hon. Senator broad - she once difference between people two food of distinction et estimated she that he there ago instead of people necessity compensation , Chair given that once cinquantaine of years resulted 9.7 since that once human huge contained the sector Heritage of people media ago accepted health dignity of the ?
i observance by example Mr. Kenneth Thompson ago launch the of same the title of his father to the Late of Liberal Thompson .
the Senator Cools :
i thank the hon. Senator of dapper issue .
accordingly what which motivator people has et people governments foreign , I wish to specifying that I not small not health members of England as a government abroad .
i not place too insist headed - dealt .
she is health Queen of the Canada , my members .
when I I fact my coming to the Senate favour 1984 , after wheel been escortée the term of endorsed care , I I implemented health document Act la Bible et I I came oath , et what is to endorsed members that I I came the oath of meet .
health Queen of the Canada not is not a government abroad .
i I may - perhaps evil before people comments of the hon. Senator .
if what is the case , I him place expected of contribute of other Particulars .
from people has are Commons everyone the time .
he there ago $ people Canadians which members contained of people legislatures legislatures everywhere contained the world .
the hon. Senator apply special certainly of once meeting of the IPU , to commentary we we attended all people two he there ago few months , et where I I met of people citizens Travellers which members to of people legislatures legislatures of certain country baltes , I believe .
health chamber des people Lords is a the , not once legislative legislative , et he there ago series enormous difference between once legislative legislative et a the .
health chamber des people Lords is once party institution .
she is once of people more ancient of the world .
what is may - perhaps because that lot of condolences friends face resulted sat to health chamber des people Lords , but I appartiens to the group of people Canadians which . lot of Alternative asset endorsed chamber .
lights me ago national , when I route small daughter , to health Barbade , that when everyone the rest Partnerships the , he many always health possibility of favour call to health chamber des people Lords .

i look the Senator to apply the to finer asset forward once proposal Convey Act the study of people 209 the et the regarding of people Canadians to these 209 .
Roberta endorsed proposing modern where the lights performance of people 209 héréditaires , I not think not that Holiness name authority too of 209 héréditaires to the Canada .
i not I not succeeded to favour find of new .
i I have a number already of 209 of chevaliers contained condolences bring .
transport examples which me are immediately came to the mind are obviously Liberal Thompson him - even et , well heard , the former - Prime Minister of the Canada , Mr. R . B . in , which , as we the know , took summer appointed vicomte favour 1941 .

That the of people efforts which resulted been facts contained the 9.7 by various parties political favour standpoint of disabilities contained health Charter Canadian of people rights et freedom a right to health life privacy .
i I takes by mistake Mr. Chr Partnerships been the Minister of la Howe of the government Trudeau before people election of 1979 .
gold , he not favour is nothing .
booted . Chr is become Minister of la Howe when the government Trudeau ago retired the power favour 1980 .
always contained my speech of the 4 November , I I opened once parenthèse to comments of the character will of people data of the census .
health question ago summer raised more earlier today today meetings of la statement of senators of our colleague , the Senator Milne .
i I spoke of la campaign favour dissimilar , which could takes health Modified of la bill Proposed by that has Laurier , the health information of people information gain et to character private tax to the opportunity of a census .
singing the era , I me route opposed by principle to what that health bill authorized be .
since , of people Canadians indignés by endorsed decision me resulted written - et same , contained certain case , these people were the - essentially of people people that health généalogie interest .
my response , that I the to what day , Partnerships been health significant : that lights us the these ' of protection , et we people report , run he is asked to the Parliament of modify health bill .
but , based the principle General , I the my decision .
i estimated that should remain confidentiels all information gain et Woodlot , far by the government contained the context of a census , based la faith of once bill the health information of people these satisfy .
i estimated , by principle , that we should avoid of modify health bill to health lightly .
after everyone , to the incorrigible of people years , people issues InterProvincial contained the framework of people the are become of more favour more indiscrètes , et what not is not because that people people décèdent that the government may apply respected the of his obligation of meet health information promise to these persons .
what is my view , honourable senators .
Roberta of people room reassess that the Senate , we should we hold Act our training opposite to people dialogue be of certain historians , experts favour Science payroll et journalists of we small that the right of officers et of information of people satisfy should the just Act all people other rights learning .
what is why I I préconisé that we envisagions of disabilities a right to health protection of people information gain contained health Charter Canadian of people rights et Freedoms .
i issue fully that we we here a conflict or once the between two principles legitimate , the a Chair the access to the information et the another health protection of people information gain .
as asset everyone another conflict of principles , he tangibly trying of find a fair balance .
endorsed the of principles or of values process also contained the bill of bill whose we impotent before .
as I me am committed to the do , I I met a number number of parties interested or the by what bill of bill or I I strokes with firms of people conferences 27 or still I I read carefully strip ' .
i not I not changed of notice to the topic of what bill of bill .
i not I not your time today today favour make of include the Richard that they manage asked to give Before the comit , I favour am sure .
however , I like gallery some of people prices issues Act reasons the comit show apply Lavoie .
honourable senators , he there ago series mind extraordinary same home the government et coloured advisors ownership to whether if what bill of bill apply youth to the sector of people care of health et how .
the Senator Kirby , the for of the bill of bill , could well whatever speak of endorsed issue when he certain a term to the debate favour second reading .
however , he show do better that what that he ago fact contained dapper statement few which serving to the 120 of people 16 of the Senate of the 4 November where he ago said :
honourable senators , the bill of bill C - 6 paving apply apply to all people sectors of Business , regardless of la setting of people businesses .
confirms understand also the sector of la health .
he paving allow of protect people information gain favour 1910 of health which resulted been tax , used et information contained the framework of activities trade .
booted . government et the Department of the CRTC resulted indicated asset their share that the bill of bill not apply youth not to people doctors , to people patients et to people hospitals .
i wish to say that what standpoint of standpoint is line favour issue et , Ambassador fact , could by of many parties interested et strip advisors Legal .
what is the case by example of the Association Canadian of people care of health , which represents people hospitals of the Association medical Canadian , of the Association medical of the Ontario et of the Department of la Health of the Ontario .
he apply notional headed of agencies which resulted a standpoint of standpoint diamétralement opposed Act the investigate of the bill of bill et what that lights should favour do .
yet , they are of agreed Act a standpoint , authorized that the sector of la health not may living with the ; et health mind negotiations what bill of bill favour what which motivator his Application to the sector .
health mind Her favour part of the less of the fact that the bill of bill is fiscal apply apply to people " activities trade " .
that stand - lights by headed ?
lights said contained the bill of bill that once " Business commercial " is :
obviously Business process thus that everyone offence . which are a character trading ...
endorsed definition not is not very useful .
yet , lights me said that people laws federal are pleines of are which are almost identiques to similar - side favour what which ago truck to the Business commercial .
the idea is that lights suggests to people courts the experts of decide contained each case what which engaged once Business commercial .
the hon. Fernand Robichaud ( His Hon. the Speaker Acting ) :
honourable senators , the time of speak of the Senator Murray ago period .
leave is - she granted to the hon. Senator of pursue ?
from people Senators :
from agreed .
the Senator Murray :
i thank people honourable senators asset their very .
frankly , I not me am never agreement to health wearing which knew to 45,000 minutes the intervention of the Senator which answer .
i not me route not realized account that I sworn 9.7 tree of time Act la first part of my intervention .
i not favour I more asset very long .
health question is of whether if health relationship doctor - men , contained health extent where he there ago $ people serious , or health relationship hospital - men , still once once contained health extent where he there ago $ people serious , are of nature commercial .
that firms the viability or non , he there ago novice same a problem .
i quote :
according the AMC , he not there ago not really average of do once distinction between the Business commercial et the Business of care of health of once manner which evidence of apply ensure that people information words contained the file medical viability subject to of people rules different of Right reflect are the people other information .
that same if once ceremony distinction guardian possible , the dilemma citing the same asset the government because citing - he desirable that people worked Carstairs not viability subject to no wearing ?
otherwise said , people agencies which . currently of the information sur la health able - they has that they not are not subject to people provisions of the bill of bill C - 54 because that endorsed information fact part of the file of health ?
as you the know , the executive C - 54 is 22 which Partnerships been days to what bill of bill to the opportunity of la sessional certain .
health Seneca apply Turcot :
accordingly under of a becomes regime , people worked of health bound subject to of people criteria less high that those which resulted dissimilar asset people information tax contained the context trading .
what is headed the Propriety of a standpoint of standpoint .
health same view is Parliament by the Association Canadian of la health , which represents people hospitals .
she apply tax Act once view legal that she ago obtenue of the practice of lawyers Heenan Blaikie of Montreal , which specific what which following :
... non only the Propriety " Business commercial " is - she very , , but she is also totally the to our notice contained the context of the system of health of today today .
singing the dissimilar of people recent years , the system of health is become a network of services if complex et if companies that whole extent designed to mean sideshow inclusion " Business commercial " of the system of health to people purposes of the bill of bill C - 54 are sideshow to of people results illogiques , or et said .
i not wish not changed exagérément health question but , Ambassador wearing general , he is to my notice fair of say that people agencies of the field of la health whose people activities are plainly et indubitablement of renvoi trading apply face to what bill of bill et looking that everyone the sector of la health the to coloured provisions .
when I talking of " these " agencies , I wish say between other people pharmaciens , people Federal et people businesses which . , 116 et vendent of people data of the field of la health , Subcommittee once form amount or another , et certain agencies of research et universities whose people activities include a in trading .
they serious that the obligation of obtain the consent of people people before of information of people data favour 1910 of health is too onéreuse .
singing their notice , endorsed requirement study seriously their business to Camera a body of information make designed to discussions to once wish political et to once wish management contained the field of la health .
they extra same hear that what bill of bill apply the by a backsliding serious of la research medical to the country .
the Ontario Campaign Association rejected that the bill of bill is to with la Act Act people doctors et health Act Act the consent to people care of health .
singing their notice , people laws provincial should wheel us .
all these persons common that the predatory of protocoles give citing more effective that once bill federal asset ensure health protection of people information Act people care of health .
singing the hour Current , I confess say that of other persons well to the fact of people laws provincial not are not also have .
accordingly fact , lights said sometimes that health bill inquiry is once bill Act the access to people information rather that Act la protection of people information .
i not wish not say by headed that the Ontario Campaign Association et the Association Canadian of people care of health not apply interest not to health protection of people information Act people care of health .
he there ago still headed the to the level of people values , or to everyone the less of people priorities .
transport purposes yesterday by these groups arise of people concerns that I in of institutionnelles opposite to the business to run , to meet et to improve the system of care of health .
they concerned that what bill of bill freine health collaboration between people sectors public et private favour what which ago truck to the funding or to health Benefit of people care of health .
i I same read contained a of people purposes that confirms could prevent health Cross Bleue or the Bouclier an of the Canada ' obligations strip responsibilities favour Ontario contained the field of people care of health .
he citing , according themselves , difficult , engineers same impossible asset the government federal of implement favour implementation people recommendations of his Council Advisory Act the infostructure of la health which ago presented his rapport favour February 99 .
singing the while , we we people leading concerns very by by the Association medical Canadian et by the Association to Canadian .
the Association medical Canadian says that health protection of la information of the file medical of the men must the just Act whole another consideration .
she wherever that what bill of bill is low .
she Justice that the criminal of the Association Canadian of normalisation Act cetera apply tax the bill of bill is inadéquat favour what which ago truck to the sector of la health et she believes , as she the ago said , that the bill of bill seems wheel the access to the information asset value the .
the Association to Canadian we ago said that we must Chief the bill of bill Act several other points substantial .
she says that the bill of bill C - 6 not , not to respond to people requirements basic asset protect people Canadians against the bad brings of information gain regarding their health by of people management high et tertiaires of endorsed information .
the bill of bill C - 6 allows may - perhaps of supports several priorities of the government favour 1910 of trade the , said the ADC , but she believes that the Senate must do someone something asset Chief et strengthen the bill of bill favour what which motivator people information gain favour 1910 of health .
the Association medical Canadian et the Association to Canadian resulted all two individuals of people amendments that firms want that we is et which , of after what that I favour I including , incorporeraient essentially contained endorsed extent federal strip own . of protection of people information gain .
honourable senators , the comit is purpose to once job difficult et complex .
Before these leading which apply face learned , even contained the field of la health , he citing made of say that health truth opinion someone share between these two leading et that the government is probably had to establish a fair balance with his bill of bill C - 6 .
he citing made of favour happen to endorsed conclusion or of produced bearer argument , but what citing really too easy .
corporation , the comit show be of dispel the ; et health mind to comments of the applicability of the bill of bill to the sector of la health .
what is a field really too important .
health protection of people information gain favour 1910 of health is too important asset allowing what sector contained health mind .
he is clear that people professionals contained what field not arresting the accept because they we the resulted said .
if the bill of bill not is not clarifié , Auschwitz - side risk , once once passed , of perhaps more often according that therefore .
nil of between we not wish that he favour authorized thus .
even if we can eliminate the ; which exists ownership to the Application of the bill of bill , that répondons - we to the Association medical Canadian et to the Association to Canadian , which insistent order that health extent legislative authorized reduced the ?
should - we try of apply people provisions to everyone the sector of la health , activist trading that non trading ?
if we the advanced , we - we recommendation the power constitutional of act of la hallmark ?
finally , he tangibly participate hear Health Canada relatively to endorsed issue .
asset tree that I side , nil representative of Health Canada not is ratify evidence meetings of people hearings of the comit of la chamber des people Commons .
the comit et the Senate must benefit of people moment of the Department of la Health relatively to all people aspects of the bill of bill which end the sector of la health .
personally , I not wish not to what that the Minister up evidence , but the comit should certainly various of people officials officials of the Department of la Health to come Examine endorsed extent legislative , Chair given that similar - side visit health health .
honourable senators , we we lot of work to do .
either - we to health job , but not . not people things .
no we imposons not of get artificiels when he apply notional of once issue also important .
endorsed once - side , we not we not to we concerned of once was .
we can take the time necessary .
honourable senators , I you thank of your indulgence .
the hon. Sheila Finestone :
honourable senators , I I listened with orator interest people criticism the of our hon. colleague .
he we remind et support the importance of la question of the right to health life privacy , essentially , the right that lights us suggests tranquilles .
i believe that what is the Justice Brandeis which ago said that we recall the right that lights us suggests tranquilles , et I am well of agreed with him .
health question is of whether if what bill of bill answer to people two criteria core .
the Prime is a criterion economic et the Aboriginal motivator la justice social .
a orator number of people senators which apply friends today today favour opposite of finer include the dilemma which challenge to budget justice economic et justice social of once manner which authorized equitable asset themselves et asset people persons that we we the privilege of represent favour endorsed chamber , thereby that asset all people persons loyalty reasons we - a strong Stratton of responsibility .
honourable senators , what is with once wear whole particular that I talking today today of the bill of bill C - 6 .
i me recall that , of the time where I I to the another place , he apply why the bill of bill C - 54 , Act Act la protection of people information gain et people papers on .
my wear is of tree more vast that the once of people responsibilities et of people duties whose I am health more proud ago summer of serve favour activist that Clarkson of the comit Standing of people rights of la human et of la condition of people persons Disabled of the another place .
we we held of people hearings Act once vast needed of issues regarding health life privacy et , Ambassador 1997 , we we prepared a report entitled : " Position life privacy :
where apply i health border ? "
we we heard of people stories enough troublantes to the topic of the treatment extend to people persons Disabled et of people rights of la human which not were not well protection .
we we heard speak of people challenges that represents health new Technology to the level of la protection of people rights of people citizens of favour prevent certain of will contained their life privacy et of using people information that they découvrent to of people purposes the .
our researching me resulted fact truth people many this complex that includes endorsed issue .
he rest still lot of work to do asset strengthen our rights basic .
today today , I traiterai favour particular of la part 1 of the bill of bill et of la protection of people information gain contained the sector private .
confirms not tax favour nothing condolences reservations ownership to health second part of the bill of bill which door Act people papers on .
transport provisions of la part 2 of the bill of bill are essential asset facilitate the trade the which is become if important asset the economy Canadian Current et whose the importance not Kelleher that increase to the incorrigible of people years .
asset the payment , I like mostly me focus Act la definition of la protection of la life privacy et of the use of people information gain .
transport provisions of the bill 28 C - 6 designed to ensure health protection of la life privacy future a orator not contained health right leadership , mostly to people influence of those which constataient the get need of better protect what right .
accordingly existing people principles of la protection of people data recognized internationalement to people businesses corporations of responsible federal , the bill of bill 8 toward a regime hard of protection of la life privacy .
from people laws Act la protection of people information gain et Act the trade the are already favour emerging of perhaps forward favour Europe , contained the Union European , to the OECD , Ambassador Scotia - Zealand et favour Australia .
transport Americans are concerned because that they not care not of mechanisms precise of protection of people information trading .
they élargissent currently health scope of endorsed protection asset power strengthen their Business commercial .
we we also need of do of the trade , honourable senators .
i am pleased that we we dirigions contained endorsed seaway thanks to what bill of bill .
i remind to people honourable senators that health protection of people information gain not is not once something to commentary lights may think after encourage contained once society democratic .
the Commissioner to health protection of la life privacy , Chapter Phillips , run occupies of these issues , of same that of Right which within of la Act Act the access to the information .
these two laws arresting sometimes remedy favour conflict , but all two resulted asset obligation of protect all people citizens .
health Act Act la protection of people information gain act health Donor , the use et health communication of information gain by of people institutions Change .
she is very self et ago summer effective until here .
singing my notice , the Commissioner Phillips apply is very well , of endorsed function .
the Commissioner to health protection of la life privacy of the Canada took contrary that health strength which anime people corporations décentes is the Alternative of the principle of fairness .
we must we deal people absolutely people other with a level reasonable of Alternative .
we not must not we the favour cachette with of people information that we can using against of other persons .
the bill of bill C - 6 VI to ensure the Alternative of what principle of fairness et of décence .
singing my notice , the bill of bill ago balance the balance do which apply thing between health need asset people businesses Forces of wheel access to of people information gain asset exercise strip activities et health need asset all people citizens of function health Donor , the use et health communication of people information which people step .
he is twelve to good number of between we of wheel once he to people letters which déborde of new not of everyone type .
we we made Robbie to damned magazine we we taken a abonnement or still breaching Purchase we we fact to the average of once to of credit , of hallmark that we , what that we the to our door , contained the s et by the councils of our telephone , et we not impotent not me .
what which we am , what is that our names viability wheat .
composite of we is a subject of trade , once marchandise .
Roberta damned extent want - we function endorsed marchandise asset protect of people information gain ?
the own asset establish a balance is obviously contained the section in the subject of the bill of bill .
i this that health extent ago need of perhaps amendée et clarifiée .
i know if we moving do a compromise et we hear , but I pleased certainly more to the private if endorsed issue Command the subject of a review more review .
transport provisions Act la protection of la life privacy recognize that we some contained once proposing where health Technology , of more favour more health foreign et the Exchange of information .
what is a wording that he not compensated not forget .
the bill of bill C - 6 not is not once the asset all people threats to health life privacy reflect compound opposite all people corporations democratic good , but he apply be Act a discussed important which is health possibility that of people information gain viability the to of people organizations to the Canada .
the bill of bill receive to people consumers of people rights favour what which motivator people information gain which people step , everything favour open the need concern of people businesses of officers et of using these information .
transport consumers must wheel trust - what is very important with Internet - et we must promote endorsed trust .
asset that our businesses the et grandissent , firms must establish a link of trust with those which materials strip services .
by therefore , health trust that ago the doing that coloured information gain manage protection contained people financial on is participate basic .
accordingly same time , people efforts asset protect people information Convey Act of people individuals not must not standard the of people costs asset people businesses .
health new extent legislative to that people businesses apply conforment to the together of practices field of treatment of the information implemented to the standpoint by people representatives of the industry .
transport groups of defence of people consumers , people from , the government et various sectors of the field of la health resulted been potential asset endorsed extent legislative of the Association Canadian of normalisation .
what is headed , I believe , once vast representation of people concerns et of people needs to take favour consideration .
transport practices field of treatment of the information whose he is issue apply " the Code type of the Association Canadian of normalisation .
what criminal is favour effect since 1996 et is fight favour Printed to the bill of bill .
he ago summer implemented to the standpoint by health society civil , people businesses , the industry , people professionals et people Canada .
a of people amendments citing whether favour the priority because he apply notional of once description very vast which fiscal a wide array of businesses trade to the Canada .
what criminal makes people obligations of people businesses which . , composed et members of people information gain .
transport businesses must leadership to people persons to substandard purposes people data are done , obtain their consent before of using or of information people information , accountability to what that people information viability well those which are necessary asset people purposes reflect they must serve - non not not regardless substandard purposes , but well people purposes reflect they resulted been tax - et protect people information by of people measures of security that .
health standard national makes also the right of people subjects of people data of see et of involved strip worked et of apply . favour case of problems .
these persons arresting apply body to someone a contained the company which seems using to bad escient or evil information people information et hold that a responsible apply occupies of the problem et cetera people measures Kyoto .
he there speaks without doubt a debate Act people improvements to contribute to the bill of bill asset the tribute more effective .
i remind to people honourable senators that a bill of bill is rarely throughout contained dapper form original ; favour fact , somewhat of things are parfaites favour what world well imparfait .
the evolution of endorsed extent legislative we montrera contained breaching sense we orienter asset contribute of people amendments which to his effectiveness Act the plan of la protection of people information gain everyone favour open people interests legitimate of people businesses Forces contained whole health extent of the possible .
a Senator ago jurist once issue to the topic of the together of people services of health .
i known the AMC , et I believe understand that she youth the oath of Hippocrate , a criminal of conduct et a criminal of Ethics .
all people doctors , who et pharmaciens must apply there act .
confirms not means not necessarily say that we must wheel everyone a , hétéroclite of measures asset advise whole maintained to the right to health protection of the identity et of people information gain to the Canada .
honourable senators , I I been very pleased of see that lights Partnerships contribution of people changes to the bill of bill presented to the departure to the another place .
he there ago strokes 16 amendments , et a number number of between themselves resulted responded to number of condolences issues et of condolences composition .
thus , health definition of people information gain ago summer amendée .
health Modified is very important , because the Propriety of now everyone what which apply states to a year identifiable .
confirms apply youth to of people things as people caméras of monitoring , people caméras placées contained people the , people information Carstairs et dentaires , people information of renvoi no , people pharmacies which livrent people Veterinary , et people researching .
however , displaced we prémunir against whole mistake - confirms is given , because our information gain once once perdus , not arresting perhaps the - , he is lost that health definition apply étende to people members of people Professional Professional et to people Canada .
i like that we apportions once Modified to endorsed provision where the lights wherever people are .
if I not me understand , endorsed provision apply wherever contained health part 1 , to the section 2 , that springs of read the Senator .
bearer section states what that he tangibly hear by Business commercial .
that is - what that once Business commercial ?
apply he apply notional of once Business commercial , the Business favour untold should perhaps couverte et she should understand of people professionals et of people agencies without purpose seaway .
i estimated that we réglerions thus certain of people problems which resulted been Arising by various agencies .
honourable senators , assure - I finishing , with your leave ?
his Hon. the Speaker :
health permission is - she granted , honourable senators ?
from people Senators :
from agreed .
the Senator Finestone :
he apply notional of satisfy related to of people effects humans identifiables et , frankly , I not like not think to themselves favour activist that groups or cercles different .
essentially , if the information that you prostituted me motivator et that you the the obtenue because that I you the I demandée asset my police of EI , of people services of health , of people services Carstairs or dentaires , endorsed information me today et she me motivator .
as condolences smaller - child the saying , she is to finer .
she is to finer et human not may apply the , if we now what bill of bill right .
the right of t not perhaps identifiables by those engage we not wish not perhaps facility - stamped , the right of t not perhaps importunés - must perhaps test contained the section of the bill of bill where are Pension people are .
i like well that we parvenions to the do .
i hope that the Minister the of modify endorsed definition et that he honourable to what that she specific that he we regardless little of where ago summer have endorsed information nor how she is a contained the world trading if the interested which the ago obtenue not Partnerships not the right of the do - he not Partnerships not my leave , he not ago not disposable my the et I not wish not that he retain endorsed information favour dapper honourable .
he tangibly also Examine health question raised to the d 7 ( 3 ) du ) of the bill of bill relatively to health communication of data to of people purposes of research .
lot of people apply away of the use of data to of people purposes of research .
he there ago petition of using of people data without address people persons .
he not there ago no reason asset that lights not incurred not the do .
lights may lead of people researching without cases the identity of people persons .
health question line by endorsed provision is the end word of the history .
reforming , honourable senators , what bill of bill is excellent same apply he must perhaps short et review to certain forth .
i believe that the bill of bill C - 6 , which fact part of la strategy necessary to endorsed end , reject health favour of la chamber et become bill .
i believe that we able do affair without problem with the Union European .
i believe that we respecterons people criteria of the OECD .
more important still , I believe that we protégerons people information gain of everyone the world .
( Act la motion of the Senator Oliver , the debate is adjourned . )
perhaps honourable senators , I am particularly pleased of speak favour favour of the bill of bill S - 10 , which VI to modify health Act Act la defence national , health Act Act the raised by people training génétiques thus that the Code criminal .
what bill of bill exists contained once wide measure thanks to the Senate et more specific to the comit Standing Standing of people Affairs Legal et Constitutional .
what bill of bill represents the the of a commitment that the Solicitor General ago retired the fall last when the comit examinait health new Act Act the raised by people training génétiques .
as you you favour recall may - perhaps , endorsed bill introduces the predatory of once per national of data génétiques which tell of deficit the associated of raised it of individuals which resulted places of people crimes serious et violent .
during his review , the comit ago century that the bill of bill not act no provision During the levy of marine the Act of people Offenders be guilty of offences serious et run et traduits contained the framework of the system of justice military , levy whose people results are then 7 contained health per of data génétiques .
the comit ago separate coloured concerns ownership to health nature extremely find of people data génétiques , to the evolution quick of la Technology regarding people training génétiques et to people risks of bringing maintained to health life privacy of people Canadians of manner imprévue .
these concerns sons natural the comit to established , contained his sixteenth report , of contribute some improvements to people measures legislatures disability health per of data génétiques .
the Solicitor General apply guardian committed to give thereafter to these recommendations favour with a bill of bill separate before health implementation favour hearts of la per national of data génétiques .
given given that the bill of bill S - 10 answer to of people issues Arising to the Senate , the Solicitor General ago asked says that he authorized presented to the Senate before the another place .
i am sure that we apprécions all endorsed initiative deM .
i sometimes now to the content of the bill of bill .
he apply notional of a bill of bill can technical , truffé of 24 to of other laws , but , essentially , coloured major elements are very little .
everyone of thanking , the bill of bill amend health Act Act la defence national et health Act Act the raised by people training génétiques of manner to include contained health per national of data génétiques people the of people individuals recognized guilty of offence to the criminal of discipline military or of offences serious et run .
the criminal apply youth to the staff military , to people Reserves et to certain civilians which major people military to the abroad .
the system of the of raised it established by the bill of bill S - 10 asset the armed following very ever the model of the system that the Parliament ago movement asset people civilians .
singing health thereafter of once condemnation asset the offence the , people judges military stay therefore the power of obtain the levy of échantillons of marine the Act of people persons justiciables of the criminal of discipline military .
transport provisions of endorsed bill rose fourth to health licensing of he are to to people the of the context military .
thus , health police military declaration ask of people he regarding people list génétiques when she enquêtera Act of people offences of renvoi military which are province to people offences high définies contained the Code criminal .
transport changes senators of people improvements notables to health bill favour effect .
Roberta the Into Present of people things , health police military may apply body to a Justice of once court Comments asset obtain a mandate Covenant to of people list génétiques contained the framework of the inquiry Act once offence the commise to the Canada , but she not may not obtain what mandate if the offence ago summer commise to the abroad .
health list of people offences désignées national contained the Code criminal not right not some offences serious to people words of la Act Act la defence national or some offences to character strictly military , by example , health is with violence .
the bill of bill poverty to people judges military the power of day of people he debates to people list génétiques favour case of offences to health Act Act la defence national of hallmark that health police military incurred lead of people investigations port more effective activist to the Canada that to the abroad .
once second series of changes Location contained what bill of bill answer directly to people recommendations of the comit Standing .
what bill of bill gives to the Senate the same power that health chamber des people Commons asset what which is of Examine health Act Act the raised by people training génétiques five years after dapper of .
these changes points specific to give to the Parliament people keep necessary asset soul the effectiveness of la per of data Act once 800 period , what which guardian once concern of the Senate .
the third Main discussed which is amended is the set of people principles of la Act Act the raised by people training génétiques , which is continuing .
he arranged indicated that people marine the financial et people the génétiques standard to printed of these marine not arresting perhaps used that to people purposes of Application of la bill .
endorsed Modified VI to respond to people concerns of the comit Standing to the topic of la concerned use possible of people the génétiques , by example asset determine people good medical , verbal or mentales of once human .
accordingly fact , confirms the some of people issues raised during the debate Act people information gain .
endorsed per of data ago slight subject of address people persons , as lights may already the do to the average of people training four .
he not apply notional not et he not apply the never of compiler of people information of renvoi staff .
from people changes Location to the Code criminal allow of protect also against everyone bad brings people data génétiques of people persons justiciables of the criminal of discipline military .
transport other changes of endorsed bill stay asset greenhouse of Chief et of strengthen the regime of levy of marine the .
pursuant to the new principle whose I just of you speak , the Code criminal arranged amended of hallmark that the system of justice military arranged also then to the ban of using to of people purposes non companies people marine the financial et people results of their analysis it .
finally , what bill of bill includes a number number of changes of renvoi practice to the Code criminal order of ensure health implementation favour implementation of la Act Act the raised by people training génétiques .
the Code criminal is therefore clarifié to bearer regard since he there is said that health something not ago not to perhaps their if the lawyer of la crown standing the court that the associated it of la human line apply wherever already contained health per national of data génétiques .
lights Foreign thus the system more effective et lights the people Estimates consequences occasionnées by health Donor et the analysis favour double of people échantillons of marine the this Act people appropriate serious .

transport Conventions tax are particularly important asset the Canada because that firms are directly related to the trade Covenant of products et of services et that firms resulted therefore once impact direct Act their his economic say .
endorsed impact is vast .
transport exports Forces future now more of 40 % of our produced InterProvincial gross annual .

he is therefore obviously that people Conventions tax prescribed contained the bill of bill S - 3 profiteront to people businesses et to people duty Travellers which second of people activities et which retirement of people investment contained these country .
transport taxpayers Travellers manage consumer happy of learn that a rate of rate set by convention not may perhaps increased without a term give .

if the lights speaks favour account health convention which would similar favour effect with the Luxembourg , people new Conventions prescribed contained the bill of bill S - 3 points two centres objectives : avoid health double taxation et advise health out taxation .
these problems are already taken favour consideration contained health convention favour effect with the Japan .

transport Conventions tax look by the Canada apply the to what problem of two ways .

second , if the income is dealing free contained people two country , Ambassador regarding of the country of residence that he small the income as Chair deal of Proposed or favour statement a credit to the title of the Proposed get to the country of origin .
from same , people Conventions of double taxation can the Exchange of information between people authorities tax favour standpoint of advise health out or the evasion taxation .
what is the Aboriginal objective of these Conventions .
the sharing of the information assistance people authorities tax to cerner people case of out et of evasion taxation et to there strategy .
accordingly what which ago truck to people Conventions prescribed contained the bill of bill S - 3 , each country funding the tax which receiving to the title of the Proposed get contained the another country part to health convention taxation .
the Canada Reorganizationand people other country apply usually of people taxes of avoid to various , of incomes of non - off .
the country of where is Somalia the income may clerical of people taxes but to a rate which apply knew usually to 5 , 10 or per % Act people dividends et people natural of people cent et to cent % contained the case of people interests et of people royalties .
Roberta certain case , people royalties payées to the title of people rights of author , of people software , of people Lands et of the whether - do are exonérées to health source .
health convention banning with the Kirghizistan , by example , knew the rate of la avoid of Proposed to per % contained the case of people dividends , of people interests et of people natural of cent et à10p. % contained the case of people royalties .
he exists some exonérations asset what which is of people interests thus that of people royalties Act people rights of author , people software , people Lands et the whether - do .
health convention banning with the Lebanon introduces once avoid of Proposed of cent % Act people dividends 7 to once society which voting to the less cent % of people Senators of la society which benefits people dividends et of per % contained all people other case .
transport natural of cent et people royalties Act people rights of author , people software , people Lands et the whether - do manage purpose to a rate of cent % et people interests to a rate of cent % .

health convention banning with la Bulgaria introduces the Application of once avoid of Proposed of cent % Act people dividends tax to once society of to the less cent % of people Senators of la society which benefits people dividends , et of per % contained all people other case .
asset what which of la convention banning with the Portugal , once society must so to the less per % of people Senators of la society which benefits people dividends asset wheel right to once avoid of Proposed de10p. % Act people dividends .
once avoid of per % apply rate contained all people other case .
once avoid of cent % apply rate also to people interests et royalties , to few proposed closely asset people interests .
accordingly what which ago truck to the Ouzbékistan , the rate of avoid of Proposed which apply rate to people dividends tax to once society which voting to the less cent % of people Senators of society which benefits people dividends arranged of cent % et of per % contained all people other case .
a rate of cent % apply rate to people interests et to people royalties , et a Proposed of cent % arranged prélevé Act people rights of author , people Lands , people software et the whether - do .
health new convention banning with la , makes à10p. % health avoid of Proposed which apply youth to people dividends tax to once society of to the less cent % of people Senators of la society which benefits people dividends , et to per % , similar which apply youth contained all people other case .
health convention introduces also once avoid of cent % Act people interests et people royalties , some exonérations apply existing to people interests Act people 209 Public et they by the government .
the bill of bill S - 3 would the Current convention of 1989 convention with the Luxembourg et introduces the Application of once avoid of Proposed of cent % Act people dividends asset once society which voting to the less cent % of people Senators of la society which benefits people dividends , et of per % contained all people other case .
a rate of cent % apply rate to people interests et to people royalties , of new to few proposed closely asset people interests et people royalties Act people software , people Lands et the whether - do .
the bill of bill S - 3 amend also the Current convention of 1986 convention with the Japan .
the measures with the Japan fact mood of 10 to cent % the Proposed himself Act people dividends between corporations et he éclaircit a number number of other provisions .
accordingly addition , the measures door specific Act la question of people taxes Japanese of company favour exonérant of these taxes people corporations Forces which have of people ships or of people aircraft contained the field of the transportation intercontinental , once extent of available already granted by people provinces Forces to people corporations stand which second of people activities similar .
honourable senators , people Conventions that 50 the bill of bill S - 3 together also Act of other issues of Conventions tax .
by example , the country of origin may impose people gains favour road gains to the Teleglobe of a well into , of active trading et of Kyoto contained people corporations the or of la involvement contained of people the or of people corporations of persons the .
health discrimination based Act la nationalité of a taxpayer is milk .
however , people measures incitatives as health allow granted to people small businesses et the credit of Proposed asset dividends whose education people Canadians not are not affected .
before of conclude , I query me consider Act la question of people migrations of people taxpayers .
four of people Conventions prescribed contained what bill of bill quality account of once 800 manner of people rules Act la migration of people taxpayers which resulted been proposed by the Minister of people Finance et which agreements part of the bill of bill budget of 99 .
these proposals points to modify health Act of the Proposed Act the income of manner to what that the Canada Marine the right of impose people gains progress by people immigrant during their came here .
singing the payment of tribute public the bill of bill favour December last , the Minister ago announced that the Canada renégocierait coloured Conventions tax asset hold account of people new rules order of avoid health double taxation .
thus , Ambassador left that these rules equipped strength of bill , the Canada took process coloured Conventions tax of manner to avoid health double taxation to the payment where people gains progress by of people immigrant , before their departure , are , .
accordingly what which motivator the bill of bill S - 3 , people Conventions with the Luxembourg , the Portugal , the Lebanon et health , quality account of la migration of people taxpayers .
however , people Conventions with the Ouzbékistan , health Bulgaria , the Algeria et the Khirghizistan not favour quality not account Chair given that firms resulted been négociées before the announcement of people proposals .
the Japan ago asked that endorsed issue of la migration of people taxpayers authorized country contained the framework of future negotiations negotiations health convention .
asset conclude , I query negative that people Conventions tax that 50 what bill of bill are conçues asset did health double taxation International of people incomes ports of a country to a another .
these Conventions tax allow of do favour hallmark that people political tax Forces viability tell uniformément to people operations look with the Khirghizistan , the Lebanon , the Algeria , health Bulgaria , the Portugal , the Ouzbékistan , health , , the Japan et the Luxembourg . Elles créeront also a atmosphere of stability asset people investors et people négociants Travellers contained these country .
honourable senators , the bill of bill S - 3 is a text legislative of nature based which VI once rate equitable et the Continuation of good Relations international et trade .
the fairness of the regime tax - which , as we the know all , modernizing once priority of the state - particularly that nil Quebecer not apply wherever taken to the piège of la double taxation .
gold , these Conventions tax points specific to ce health double taxation .
before of conclude , I query negative the work magnificent of the team of experts which resulted message what process term et work of our government .

the hon. William Kelly :
honourable senators , I am chairman of see that tree of senators of what side - side viability said asset me hear bearer after - afternoon .
i I therefore well the intent of favour benefit to the reduced .
i me brevity of the commitment taken contained the speech of the another " of ensure to what that people Forces Forces viability favour extent of support the role of the Canada asset contributing to health security contained the world " .
the - we however of Subcommittee - Use health extent contained commentary we impotent held of honour bearer commitment .
since 1988 , people Estimates so to the title of la defence national resulted reduced favour dollars still , year after year , to the standpoint that the power of Purchase of the budget of la defence is today today to little closely school to 22 of the beginning of people years positions .
transport methods whose we doing asset purchase the equipment necessary et favour ensure the maintenance resulted been particularly affaiblis by thereafter of - cut .
the group of people forces Armed actives , which guardian of the 40,000 persons favour 1989 - 1990 , should , according people additional , seven of 60 40,000 of here to health end of the fiscal financial favour dissimilar .
we not impotent already more favour extent of B.C. of people units combattantes asset the operating of earth , authorized the floor acceptable asset lead once Action military sustainable .
according people data area by the NATO , the Canada apply name to the last valued of people country members asset what which is of people cut of la the process et of people Forces creation et high of contingency .
he there favour ago provoking law that health end of la War Cold ago constitutional health need of maintain once ability military , et ongoing et ago movement once distraught of " the of peace " .
as I the I often said favour endorsed chamber , I believe that they apply trompent totally .
transport threats to health security et strip sources resulted may - perhaps changed , but the world of today today is were more instable , dangerous et the that never .
health possibility of conflict premises et regional déclenchés by of people mouvements , nationalists is always presented contained all people university of the wonderful .
health threat of terrorism by of people States renégats et of people groups television exists always .
honourable senators , I member to grounds that people repercussions international of people made of certain States constitueront health holds threat to health security of the Canada Reorganizationand of people Canadians contained a future a .
that what authorized favour Africa , contained the former - Union Soviet , Ambassador Asia of the South - Eastern , Ambassador America made or favour America of the South , he sometimes that of people States apply désorganisent , as lights the ago seen already , displaced various reasons economic , technical or political .
health désintégration of a state written a vacuum of power that apply empressent often of gap of people groups criminals or face which , to their around , the health security of people other States .
lights wherever of people examples of confirms contained the former - Union Soviet .
the effritement of the power Civil ago fact life whole once series of activities sordides .
honourable senators , the months last by example , people authorities russes resulted agreement six persons to Vladivostok which apply apprêtaient to let of the country six kilogrammes of its this asset the sell to the outside .
bearer its the of once plant where the lights démantelait some parties of the now early Soviet et of people face or of people groups criminals lend revival the using asset " of people bombs nuclear small certainly , but very destructrices .
what is to untold of threats of what type that we must remain the et maintain favour land a good service of intelligence of security et once armed outside .
i brevity the government of his commitment loyalty people military , but I hope see more of details contained the next budget federal .
the speech of the another specific people professional of the government asset the arrival of the new millennium .
lights said often that what Prime Minister et his government still of vision .
he there ago lot of special words contained the speech of the another Act la dispute to the new millennium .
i issue that to several occasions lights coordinating of facilitate , by example , the trade the et the access to Internet , but confirms not engaged not once vision amount asset tell the future of the Canada .
health economy of people economies means that all people economies become of more favour more interdépendantes .
accordingly fact , soon , he not there speaks more what that lights reserves once " economy say " .
he not there speaks more that once Gotcha economy et a odyssey market .
transport economies , people markets et health competition not manage not problems by people R national or ports .
he not there speaks more of R .
between - time , all people investors et people of Affairs international the aware to a review examination which not avoided never been possible previously , of all people economies very , there including similar of the Canada .
transport progress contained people technologies of people telecommunications , mostly people progress contained the trade the , compound that people investment arresting perhaps Similar et of people decisions arresting perhaps taken favour millisecondes .
transport capital arresting remedy contained a country or favour let favour a deal .
the year last , we we been witnesses may - perhaps of the Prime example of people repercussions of these forces et of the trade the Act the economy of people First of the Asia of the South - Eastern et of the Pacific .
these important fuites of capital including a vote of non - confidence by people investors international et health community of people Affairs .
transport repercussions apply compound feel of our days contained of people country individual , there including to the Canada , et contained the world images .
singing health thereafter of la crisis Asian , the dissimilar of the expenditures Heritage ago the by report to the expenditures validate Robbie that people cambistes resulted bought the more of dollars trillion possible asset apply protect against people $ problems .
our exports toward the part - Middle resulted school Robbie that health crisis ago victim once turn of people price of people products of basic .
transport capital et people businesses not are more linked by health s , the time or people honourable national .
once economy or a government which not apply includes not as people Banking , people Include , people courtiers favour values the et people departments of cotation contained people capitales Projections the sure arresting do the subject , quickly et the , he is true , of sanctions very about .
even if we not for may - perhaps not confirms , he not favour remains not less that the Canada not ago not of another road that of enfiler what that lights reserves a " corset economic " which shows to all that the Canada is a good place where invest et do of people Affairs to the dissimilar of the new millennium .
the term of the arranged of us what corset economic order of improve health situation of the Canada Reorganizationand of people Canadians to better respond of strip requirements et of protect people things which are special asset people Canadians et which compound part of our start of life , as by example , our system National of care of health .
whereupon that he favour authorized , to the payment where we moving deal the new millennium , the Canada took lot to do .
health debt amount of people levels federal , provincially et any is too fair et continues of fact .
our levels of rate personal future a burden regime .
accordingly despite of improvements important which resulted been Location to the dissimilar of people two recent decades , our economy understand always lot of regulations et of paperasserie .
we impotent always widely , of people resources Natural .
approximately 40 % of the GDP of the Canada continues of the trade of our resources Natural .
he there ago always of too many barriers to the trade , to the investment et to health mobility of la document - of implementation to the country .
accordingly despite of people progress challenges tell to the dissimilar of people recent years , our available of basic contained people sectors of the world of water , of people égouts et of the transportation , particularly contained people main cities , whose of people the et of people improvements important .
we must do more favour standpoint of improve our productivity .
we must favour do more contained people sectors of the education , of la research et of the development order of become the type of society innovatrice et adaptable which paving non only life but which paving also their to the dissimilar of the next millennium .
he exists always a gap large between what that the Canada is et what that he could become .
singing bearer regard , I brevity the government which ago retired the commitment contained the speech of the another of introduce of new once extent legislative designed to protect people information gain et trading contained a as the et to recognize people from on .
from similar initiatives are essential if the Canada Reorganizationand people Canadians want perhaps favour extent of benefit fully of people possibilities billion by the Internet et the trade the .
honourable senators , the évocation of the additional of money me remind that the government apply is committed contained the speech of the another to implement the responsibilities Act people threats new reflect must do opposite people Canadians , as the additional of the money .
according the Department of people Finance , of 5 to 17 billion of dollars , or as I the I read contained the newspaper what morning of 17 to 40,000 billion of dollars the each year the to the Canada or by the councils of the Canada .
the Group of Action financial Act the additional of capital , which apply composede 26 country , priorities the Canada , health Wheat European et the Council of cooperation of the Gulf an , took talk fellow the much of the Canada .
health promise eye contained the speech of the another is that .
however , we we of the hundreds Act la committees .
honourable senators , the fact that the speech of the another talking insuffisamment of the problem of the immigration illégale to the et by the Canada me ago frankly lot gêné .
we know that order of perhaps the during the next millennium , the Canada must continue of attention of people immigrant of the world images .
he is however the that our country not atteigne not coloured objectives ownership to the number of immigrant received .
the Canada took tragic per % of immigrant of less favour 1998 that to the dissimilar of the year certain .
we to got of people difficulties system asset attention of people workers et of people professionals competent .
however , confirms not means not that we - ports people influence Act the problem programs of the immigration illégale to the Canada , Ambassador organization of various regions of the world .
he apply notional of a problem get , whose people causes deep purpose contained our process of recognition of the status of refugee .
honourable senators , health the political Chalifoux difficult health held of a debate opened et rationnel Act our political et our proceedings related to the status of refugee .
obviously human which lancerait a becomes debate or which , favour issue the quo quo term the risk of perhaps qualifiée of will or of anti - the .
he not strong to nothing of novo that health most of people immigrant illégaux not fuient not health too asset strip beliefs program , political or other , but that what are of people refugees supporting improve their situation economic .
from same , he not strong to nothing of do noted that these immigrant illégaux resulted were health bill Canadian et that what is once very concerned manner of start once new life to the Canada .
i am enough proud that the comit special recent Act la security that I I chaired retain and et studies the problem programs of the immigration illégale sixth to the Canada before that he not authorized very médiatisé et not atteigne the summum of dapper médiatisation the been last .
the immigration illégale to the Canada threat the integrity of whole our political of immigration .
those which looking to come to the Canada favour apply soumettant to all people proceedings wrong people illégaux people the .
lights knows also that once vast part of the immigration illégale is the fact of organizations from .
nay only these organizations are particularly méchantes , but firms compound also pay very paid to people immigrant , to people professional financial et staff , the privilege of come favour America of the North .
a orator number of these immigrant are down to health servitude asset pay strip debts to people gangs criminals , to people " snakeheads " , which people resulted fact mood the to the Canada .
i I been happy of learn that a Justice of London Partnerships recently Judge four passeurs to of people suffered of year variant between 7 et 14 years .
according people papers tabled to the court , people passeurs sons extorqué approximately a created of dollars to strip customers .
the Justice ago daily strip activities of méchantes , and et the .
we not advanced of do to human favour the people influence Act the immigration illégale .
those which education the more of our laxisme et of our approach naïve of la determination of the status of refugee are people elements criminals which apply livrent to endorsed Business .
we must recognize that the immigration illégale not is not a problem strictly National .
if the Canada wants Kyoto ever with the government validate asset ports our border common during the economy century , as lights the . contained the speech of the another , endorsed modernization must do favour hallmark that our other R become less poreuses asset people organizations of passeurs .
singing my notice , health difficulty not opinion not contained our laws , but contained their Application .
transport problems of Application resulted been even to ground occasions .
the study the by the group of work implemented Act foot by the former Minister of la Citizenship et of the Citizenship ago signed that he not there Partnerships not of system effective favour hearts asset obtain the Alternative of people conditions cut by people RCMP of immigration to people failed of the status of refugee .
accordingly addition , the Department of la Citizenship et of the Citizenship not sure not people came et a of la most of people failed of the status of refugee , there including people thousands of persons which document once audition favour 1910 of immigration or which are Subcommittee the encourage of once expulsion .
lights speaks people training four of people failed of the status of refugee to people points of novo order of power determine apply they resulted a the judicial or apply they constitute once threat to health security of the state .
however , people RCMP of immigration resulted said to the comit Standing special that health training et the equipment dactyloscopiques whose they care are reassess that people training that they taking are to all purposes practices consequences et of habit simply Iraq .
by therefore , we we need non not of new laws or measures , but of once strongly political et of people resources necessary asset implement favour implementation et apply people laws et people measures education .
health detention of immigrant illégaux is obviously once issue find .
tabling to people States - States et to of other country , we not emprisonnons not people immigrant illégaux to less of wheel of people reasons of grounds that they are of people criminals or that they constitute once threat asset health security of the state .
health Minister of la Citizenship et of the Citizenship apply welcome to health detention of people immigrant illégaux because that they not resulted nothing fact of evil .
she estimated therefore that people emprisonner citing of the less contrary to health Charter of people rights et Freedoms .
singing my sense - et I know that what not is not once view popular - provincial immigrant illégaux resulted fact someone something of evil .
they resulted citizens et . according health introduce Canadian of the immigration et confirms should perhaps once reason environment of people emprisonner until to their G Current to health recognition of the status of refugee .
however , the process must perhaps concerns .
transport decisions must come favour time appropriate .
lights not may not so of people people during of people months because that lights lack of staff asset off the work by .
finally , honourable senators , I brevity the government of apply perhaps committed to strengthen health ability of la RCMP et of other agencies of total people threats to health security Public to the Canada Reorganizationand of Kyoto with people forces of the order of other country .
what is quite , but , I the indicated , he tangibly decide until where lights may go .
still headed , I am , of see people details contained the next budget .
honourable senators , to the approach of the new millennium , he receiving of ponder to people minority recent years .
the century which apply on ago summer International by once off incredible et of people massacres sanglants without precedent sector essentially to the nationalism inconsidéré et to the extrémisme to .
what naturally also a century of progress without precedent .
transport people which resulted lived favour from not reconnaîtraient more the world of today today .
he tangibly expect that we we Somalia of people lessons of the 20 century et that people progress progress we , a new century more fair , unless déchiré by people means et people followed of nationalism et of ideology , where health freedom economic et political arranged whose .
if we we learned our lessons , the next century we réservera to we et to the world images of people possibilities inimaginables .
finally , honourable senators , contained the world complex toward cetera we we the , I wish la wish of people wish to the government , to 22 to the power currently et to those which him succéderont .
he 50 enormous of wisdom asset success to the future , lot more that by all people years proposed .
the hon. B . Alasdair Graham :

he there ago may - perhaps strokes few rare opportunities where he ago summer necessary of do Appeal to the offer of colleagues , but I hope that all people honourable senators long that I me am always ' of provide the information health more specific et health more full possible account held of people circumstances .
honourable senators , when Vaclav Havel , Chairman of la Republic tchèque , took retired health speak Before people two Houses of the Parliament meetings of once Recent visit to the Canada , he ago spoke of a world favour full considerable of once period of changes , .

the commitment Heritage to the well public is a original which apply wanted to the heart of endorsed community well special .
he ago fact of our society kind , civilisée et tolérante a instead of hope et of gone asset of people million of persons of everywhere contained the world .
accordingly pleased dapper wife , His Excellency health Gouverneure general of the Canada , read the speech of the another raised October last , he me is education plainly that health passionately national ongoing , health passionately asset a balance et asset the service of la population , the heart of what that we impotent et the now of our origins , rest , Ambassador mind , also lost et dynamic that to the everyone beginning of our history .

now that the government ago implemented of the order contained people Finance translated et that the economy is damned et favour full by , we can mood to once new proposing of management Public self responsible , but to our timeless .

the chairman of the University of Toronto , Robert Dr. , took substantial that endorsed initiative to she Gotcha équivalait to the the staff enseignant of once vast university almost of the day to the next , a want costs of funding incommensurable .
as the Prime Minister the ago said :
a place where a environment must et once right quality of life submariners of the , a place where our young include that assist not is not sideshow once issue of share of market , but well once issue of value , of service et of commitment to our deep .

they resulted the right of must .
they resulted the right to the equality contained what magnificent country which is the ours et which represents a symbol of hope et of gone asset of people million of persons to the world , the Canada .
the hon. ë A . Kinsella ( cc Deputy of the Opposition ) :
honourable senators , before of do condolences hear contained what debate Act the speech of the another , I query everyone of thanking offer condolences congratulations et condolences best vows to his Excellency health Gouverneure general to the beginning of what new mandate .
these 407 Canadians litigants a orator privilege et once enormous responsibility .
they serving to themselves recommendation 30 million of Canadians contained our Parliament .
Seneca few - few of people issues which not cessaient of me come to the mind favour by Act the speech of the another et favour by Act the Parliament : how apply includes the ship of the state to people influence of people 407 parliamentarians Travellers which are strongly of the soul ?
is - what that health practice of la freedom is more damned or more low ?
the Canada that we the after our came to the Parliament arranged he better ?
accordingly response to these issues , I I been natural to health conclusion that our Freedoms to the Canada in Act la basic of once hallmark of the of institutions basic .
health more upper decision to the country , health Court Supreme of the Canada , is health target of farmers corrosives of la share of certain cercles .
some of people farmers people more run against the judicial are the fact of Members parliamentary of the another place .
Roberta dapper response to the speech of the another , the Opposition of the Party Reform contained the another place to said rejecting :
... individual courts resulted of more favour more empiété Act people the of the Parliament to the standpoint where lights may say that he is impossible of out the speech of the another before of wheel read 22 of people courts .
this well , honourable senators , certain auditeurs resulted revival find confirms , .
from other resulted may - perhaps found that what guardian once proposal technical or charming .
personally , I not I not found confirms , .
i not I not found more , that the Opposition of the Party Reform contained the another place apply like to Iraq of criticism people courts of various local asset people case outstanding contained their assessment of people measures taken by people governments federal , provincial or territorial , by report to health Charter of people rights et Freedoms .
what guardian as if people courts were favour someone hallmark responsible of the existence of la Charter Canadian of people rights et Freedoms .
i rappellerais quickly to people Canadians that he ago special the the of people two Houses of the Parliament et of nine legislatures legislatures provincial asset that authorized agreed health Act BNA of 1982 .
he regardless that we , parliamentarians , évaluions health vision of the government et people programs which favour 12 asset determine if composite of these programs the our courts contained of people situations more difficult or less , .
when I I available the speech of the another , nothing contained what last not me ago compelling that the government Partnerships another something to offer that a program vacuum .
the government seems avoid people criticism political concerns favour the endorsed strategy .
he will to people courts people tasks , which consistent to out of people laws very call or too , .
the government not ago not word do Evidence of enough of exercise , not ago not strokes health vision political et legislative necessary asset do favour hallmark that the Parliament operating of la manner portion to the origin .
what which focuses more to the independence et to the role of the power judicial these months time , what is that certain levels of government seem evil understand the report which should having between the power executive et the power judicial .
transport honourable senators resulted follow very carefully the judgment that ago realized health Court Supreme contained the affair Marshall .
what judgment the certain rights the of treaties et ago typical of people consequences very déplorables contained health province that I represents , the Brunswick - Brunswick .
during what time , the Prime Minister the health possibility that health Court Supreme retienne his judgment contained the affair Marshall enough long asset allow to the government of adopt people regulations necessary asset reduce people levels of , .
even if we - all to avoid endorsed , , we convinced always to people taken with la question of living political contained people work of the more senior court of the country , which shows plainly how the power executive making to play of the muscle contained the field judicial et representations of institutions which compound part of our form of democracy Parliamentary .
honourable senators , he is dangerous that a Prime Minister asking to people courts of do strip work of manner to promote the regime favour hearts .
health bill is health bill .
he not tangibly nor health plier nor the adapt asset that she consistent the affair of a party political which is to the power .
singing endorsed separation less strong between the executive et the judicial , he tangibly add health reaction ' of a orator number of parliamentarians , mostly to the another place .
since the time that I am to the Senate , I I rarely , et I doubt same that what authorized twelve , heard a Appeal asset address of emergency a problem serious of renvoi political or Housing favour rose Points to health provision of exemption of la Charter .
yet , we hear often people people of the another place say that health provision of exemption may perhaps used asset current a problem .
the Parliament must take well custody when once ceremony proposal is a .
honourable senators , I small the Parliament as once of people three main institutions provision the fiscal of la freedom to the Canada .
a review of the number of days of postponement of people various legislatures legislatures et of people two Houses is strong to .
status to the held that the government ago implemented to hold health rentrée Parliamentary bearer fall .
health chamber des people Commons , the institution which is the incarner health democracy to the Canada , sits favour average less of 120 days each year .
certain parliamentarians apply looking why they should apply down of perhaps behalf here et serious that what is once any loss of time of sit to the Parliament because that the government to the power not apply soucie not the aware of their notice .
Roberta well of people case , even of little Members of the government apply wrong retirés of a Committee by example favour thought of the asset apply perhaps who to the power Central .
these people - headed very people rules parliamentarians as nothing of more that of people barriers to be contained health getting of objectives supporters .
he there also those which are of notice that the Jews of people saints , otherwise said the Block Langevin , took everyone fact asset , people measures et people decisions which are taken by the government Present contained the framework of the Parliament .
why the Prime Minister et people ministers of the cabinet not want - they not that the Parliament seat ?
health response is legal , honourable senators .
otherwise the Parliament of dapper ability of And of people measures legislatures et of important issues of are is health technical which ago summer used by the government Present asset the health needs of endorsed institution .
a file , by example , we gives health Evidence that the Block of the Centre not is not prepared to allow to the Parliament of apply carry of dapper job .
if the lights apply be to the context negotiations the Agreement the nisga' ago , whose between health Nation nisga' ago et health province of Columbia - Columbia , lights Presentation that he ago summer signed by people two parties after wheel been passed by the Assembly legislative of la Columbia - Columbia et accepted by people Nisga' determined .
his Hon. the Speaker Acting :
i confess interrupt the hon. Senator Kinsella et him gallery that health period of time are asset his speech is year .
honourable senators , the Authorized of pursue is - she granted ?
from people Senators :
from agreed .
the Senator Kinsella :
honourable senators , before that the Parliament retain strokes the opportunity of value the treaty nisga' ago , the Minister of people Foreign Indian the Partnerships already signed .
the obligation of tribute of people account to the Parliament irrite lot the Prime Minister et his cabinet , which is become his group of reflection private .
singing the breast of the cabinet , the Prime Minister not apply the more of perhaps the Prime Incidence coloured in .
health nature of of the government apply continuing also to all people levels .
the cabinet réprime health involvement political et the making of people Members of once - back , of people Members of the Opposition , of people committees et of people citizens .
singing the level basic , health must of account to the Parliament by people for of the Block Langevin is acts nowhere .
endorsed attack research lancée against health responsibility loyalty the Parliament is the et deserves that the lights apply asking if the speech of the another clarifie or non the fact that the government is always responsible loyalty the Parliament .
Roberta our form of government , dérivée of similar of Westminster , health responsibility yesterday is health re education of la practice Parliamentary et , contained what , of government , he is found the that the cabinet or the Prime Minister dominent health function political of the Parliament without that people members of people two Houses not viability give potential .
i query do noted the impuissance of the government to advise the the of our system political favour too the career Philip Norton which , continuing of the regret of the government to apply driver as the require the principle of la responsibility , wrote that with people years , people instruments of the Parliament apply are émoussés .
he Auditor :
the government is also become more réticent to will coloured satisfy to health chamber .
... ... tienne huge powers centralisés one more to those that the lights this normally to once dictatorship autocratique that to those of a government democratic .
et that :
the Parliament is the forum Central asset discuss of the use et of the abuse of power political .
i query favour ending speak of what third sector to the service of our democracy , what is - to - say 22 of people agencies volunteers et non Public .
i I been the , honourable senators , of see that the speech of the another not Command fact reference to endorsed next give of the role of people agencies volunteers contained the world .
lights not wherever nil support can or the of people agencies volunteers of la share of the government favour hearts .
what is rather the contrary .
almost all people gone that the lights wanted contained the speech of the another resulted fourth to once extent whatever company by the government Central .
since people UN Voluntary resulted Syd the year 2001 in International of people agencies volunteers , he me seems , honourable senators , that the government avoided revival do a own asset do share of la provision of our country to negative the importance of people agencies volunteers non Public .
accordingly conclusion , honourable senators , I query revert to the professor Donald Savoie , whose we we spoke to several occasions favour of other opportunities , et to his draw released recently Subcommittee the title Governing from Chairperson Centre .
Roberta once analysis tranchante of people powers of the Prime Minister et of people changes Somalia contained people powers to the Canada , the professor Savoie states :
the cabinet , everything as the Parliament , is now through .
transport real debates political apply quality of more favour more elsewhere , et what is also the case of people decisions which are often taken to the dissimilar of people meetings federal provincial of people premiers ministers , during people meetings the that people premiers ministers quality during people president of Team Canada , contained the office of the Prime Minister , to the Council private , to the Department of people Finance , contained people agencies international et to the dissimilar of Moncton international .
nothing not seems leadership that health human which voting all people cartes , authorized the Prime Minister , et people agencies centraux which him amounts of focus people power political to the centre , equipped the intent of change whereupon that what authorized .
the Prime Minister of the Canada is little submitted to the control care , of the less to the InterProvincial of the government , which the future of act to dapper thought .
account held of what change of , , lights may very well understand health frustration of people Members , et sometimes same of people senators , which not resulted nothing to say to the level of la implementation to the standpoint of people political , et to which lights gives the order of do current once initiative of the government , often same without reflection no .
honourable senators , the speech of the another is the mechanism which allows to the government Present of do share of dapper manner of see the country et of give the market to the functioning of endorsed institution .
he is clear that people bases same of our democracy Parliamentary are if et that the lights ago not fact orator - something asset the people interest .
the hon. , DeWare :
honourable senators , we , to the Senate , impotent all very know of the importance of the Secondary post activist asset people Canadians any that asset the Canada contained his together .
those which fréquentent people colleges , people universities et other institutions of Secondary post favour however of people benefits incommensurables .
confirms right people benefits Include which amounts to people graduates of reach to a level of life better asset themselves - executory et strip families .
confirms right also of other benefits less tangibles but everyone also substantial favour words of quality of life , which amounts also to people graduates of play a role importance contained the great of strip communities .
these benefits apply transmettent then to the economy et to health society Forces Subcommittee health form , by example , of revenues tax more high , of economies of costs of people programs Cultural et of cohesion social ill .
still more important of our days is the advantage competitive that once population huge we gives to the Canada contained the economy World .
transport businesses of people sectors favour full growth of la knowledge et of la Technology of sunrise investiront more probably contained a country where firms arresting would of people graduates well , émoulus of good institutions of Secondary post .
he is obviously that the government federal recognizes him also the role given of the Secondary post to the Canada .
Roberta the speech of the another , he ago recognized " the advantage that represents asset the Canada once document - of implementation which is health more we to the world " .
the government ago also takes that , to the dissimilar of people three recent years , he ago retired of people measures asset learn party of bearer advantage .
the speech of the another ago underlined of people measures which 28 to facilitate the plans - studies asset people children et ago mention people scholarships of studies Forces of the millennium which , according the government , marine to tribute more private people studies collégiales et university .
he ago also earlier the tax of the mechanism of Customs of people debts étudiantes et the improvement of people measures tax asset promote the learning for .
accordingly fact , I believe that he ago spoke of " strategy " favour évoquant the together of these measures .
the government said now that he account continue of apply support Act endorsed strategy favour 5 several initiatives .
the speech of the another Command health vast announcement that the government federal :
... legislation of people partnerships with people other governments , people agencies Public et Woodlot thus that with people Canadians et people mandate , sooner of establish a plan of Action National favour 1910 of skills et of learning asset leXXIe century .
what plan certain the responsibilities Act the learning for , run this to the problem of la low literacy home people adult et process to people citizens the information whose they resulted need asset take of people decisions the favour standpoint of parfaire strip skills .
honourable senators , the speech of the another ago difference three military of what plan of Action , but I hope thing that of other apply there ajouteront soon .
more specific , the government ago said that he the with coloured partners order of :
d allow to people Canadians of secondary more . the learning for ; et
d provide of people information to the environment of the Canada Act people markets of the work , people skills necessary et people possibilities of training to printed of a - uniqueness , accessible by Internet , by telephone , or favour human contained all people communities of the country .
honourable senators , all these measures arresting perhaps very past .
once Action contained these three areas agree , which resulted been cernés he there ago nearly of two years by the comit Standing special Act the Secondary post , run thing much et is attendue since long .
i wish also to congratulate the government of apply perhaps committed to improve the infrastructure of the whether favour proper of people instituts Travellers of research favour health , Ambassador issues his support to people advice 20 et favour consider people universities et people instituts of research of the Canada to . health collaboration International favour 1910 of research , even if people details are , I the indicated , enough obscurs .
after everyone , health R - D is a another sector key that ago mention the comit Standing special of the Secondary post .
i I understood with changes that , pursuant to several recommendations of our Committee , the government seems recognize that he worth health worth of attention of people researchers of Prime plan et of encourage our graduates to pursue their career to the Canada rather that of apply exiler .
we must tribute health situation more , asset that our graduates of studies post remain to the Canada order of ensure the advantage competitive that we we thanks to our document - of implementation we .
account held of the attention more vast which is granted to the paid of people funding of the Canada , whose people media speak lot , endorsed intervention is particularly appropriate .
Roberta once study that he ago submission recently , the property compelling of the Canada took Syd that the paid of people funding , which is of more favour more important , threat of vider the provide of workers mentioned to the Canada .
from more , the Prime president of - , John Roth , took mention that dapper company show vigorous the Canada if nothing not is fact asset - health annual of road timeless .
bad noted that he rest to the Canada only cent % of people outside senior of - , he avoided Syd , according the The Ottawa Citizen of the 12 November , what which following :
singing whereupon good wheel a seat Housing to the Canada when health more vast part of the team of people leaders of la company is part ?
account held of the fact that 22 40,000 employees of - call to the Canada Reorganizationand that , each year , health company commitment the off of people engineers graduates , to the Canada , lights not may take confirms to health lightly .
even Statistics Canada , that lights ago fellow asset wheel . the importance of the paid of people funding , took admitted that people graduates Travellers which apply the to the south of la border are often people best , people more brilliant .
even if several causes resulted been relevées asset explain endorsed migration victims , he is clear that the system of Secondary post to the Canada is a factor .
i remind to people honourable senators that the Ottawa Citizen of the 12 November attribuait also Mr. Roth health how significant :
health quality of people diplômes favour Officer et favour Phenomenon has to the Canada is good , but I concerned that she not unemployment to untold of the funding inadéquat of the system of education .
honourable senators , we must we ask if people measures that people Liberals ways contained the speech of the another as , as the said the government , displaced establish " once strategy therefore to operating the advantage that represents asset the Canada once document - of implementation which is health more we to the world " .
accordingly fact , once once implementation favour implementation , endorsed strategy ' she to maintain health quality of our document - of implementation we ?
i think that he tangibly do lot more contained the sector of the Secondary post asset 50 people results that the government we ago promised .
i chair early that the speech of the another we move an little of safe asset enrober these words to health start which apply want rassurants .
i chair still better tell that he there authorized issue of certain sectors of the Secondary post that the government seems wheel complete mining , of people sectors which , to my notice , which once importance Capital if we want financial Act the plan of the whether to the the of the economy century et not not it a backsliding or , with a little of fortunate , do simply of the Act - handed .
Roberta the C of people observations appointments evening John Roth , of - , I wish speak more particularly of the funding of the Secondary post to the Canada .
the comit whose I 6 part ago daily of extremely made the assistance that the government federal et people provinces general to the Secondary post .
the comit ago also recommended that " the government federal , everything favour by to meet people skills provincial , renouvelle his strong commitment contained the sector of the Secondary post " .
the Subcommittee - funding of people universities et colleges Travellers , due favour part to people cut designed the Health Heritage favour 1910 of health et of programs Cultural , took typical , between other things , once net of people costs of tuition , once month of the equipment et of people available verbal thus that once power of attention people members of the body professoral people more mentioned contained people institutions post of a coast to the another .
transport costs of tuition high wisdom consumer of tribute the Secondary post inaccessible to of many students Travellers .
health distraught of obtain his presently et of perhaps Robbie criblé of very debts of studies that people scholarships of the millennium not wisdom situation of reduce lot may , by example , perhaps a discussed dissuasif given .
apply he is important of implement of people loans et of other forms of assistance to health provision of people students , he tangibly however limiting people impotent that a learned should wheel to use .
i me méfie of la promise that fact the government contained the speech of the another of facilitate the funding of the education ongoing .

however , if the government apply move of grant more of scholarships or of the have of debt , endorsed promise me paraîtra more around .
transport Canadians manage impatients of see to the dissimilar of people two next years what that the government ago to the fair to the mind .
accordingly addition , we we extremely look of see how the government et coloured partners agreements favour hallmark , as the introduces the speech of the another , that the youth of people skills suive the pace of the evolution of the economy .
i hope thing that confirms not apply study not to cerner people Professional , people the et people jobs contained compete lights speaks need of graduates contained people years to come , Joe confirms authorized once company important .
endorsed initiative should rather well Act of people measures concrete designed to assist people students to obtain the education et health training necessary asset e these needs .
i the indicated , people Canadians will of closely what that the government federal Kelleher to the dissimilar of people two next years to bearer regard .
i believe that people Canadians not should not wheel to wait two years before that the government moved people gone that he ago coupon contained the speech of the another regarding the Secondary post .
i remind to the government that he tangibly act early now contained what sector critic .
i remind also to people senators that what rapport of the comit is already old of two years et that he guardian get of the honour .

the section 5 of la Act of interpretation standing that health Assent Royal the to health date of novo favour effect of once bill , to health condition that no no another date not authorized the .
well that health ceremony of la Assent Royal as ceremony not authorized opinion contained nil text of bill , the draw of Beauchesne favour gives a descriptif .
the Clerk Deputy of the Senate is charged of his organization matérielle .
the Canada is the odyssey country to wheel Business endorsed ceremony official which taking health presence of the this or of the Governor General or of their representative .
the report by of that " the Canada continues of do Appeal to once practice the by the Parliament British favour 1967 .
accordingly fact , nil another country of the Commonwealth not the ago the . "
singing the Kingdom - Economic , health Assent Royal ago statutory health presence of the monarque until favour 1541 , when people Lords board resulted been strongly of represent the this .
as we the know all , the Parliament apply transfer of three 6 , health members , the Senate et health chamber des people Commons , each Chair cash to health which of a bill of bill .
our ceremony of la Assent Royal rassemble these 6 asset health last reading of the process sometimes term which . the Adopted of a bill of bill .
well that health members not refuses not health Assent , he tangibly everyone of same health ask .
a commentateur ago written that health Assent Royal is always once formality necessary , but nothing of more that once formality .
i concerned , everything as of other , that what which should perhaps a event important not authorized become once ceremony of routine which not C that once low to home those which apply friends to favour perhaps witnesses by strong .
too often , the Governor General not may perhaps subsection , et he is difficult et the of find a Governor General Acting to term give .
too often , the Acting must wait task - deserved of the hour convenue , Ambassador reason of deliberations incidental of the Senate .
transport Members behalf are usually less many that people the , mostly if health Assent is portion after the adjournment of la chamber .
once Assent Royal hour later a Thursday after - afternoon means that little of senators manage behalf .
he China a atmosphere of indifference , rather that of Alternative , loyalty once ceremony which , well that she authorized favour vast part once formality , is dealing cooperation , et which we remind the evolution of the regime Parliamentary to the dissimilar of people centuries .
certain regulation that health Assent Royal is . et should everyone simply perhaps provincial .
i not me as not contained what debate today today , except asset say that , contained health extent where health Assent Royal is exigée , and - Status as she the deserves favour subject to health ceremony with Alternative favour reason of what that she means , rather that of la necessity as once required inopportune of people work parliamentarians .

accordingly providing once procedure different , the Parliament approuverait , Ambassador fact , the importance of la ceremony whose that represents health Assent Royal favour favour bad once opportunity special , well , et to commentary assisteraient several persons , rather that once obligation whose health allowing dilue health order .
the Opposition to what bill of bill where of those which concerned that what not authorized that the would of la end of the the becomes that we the know today today .
the bill of bill S - 7 keeps yet account of these fears .
the another procedure which is Proposed challenge to allow once Assent Royal non whose to the opportunity , when he is difficult asset people t of apply hear Act a payment which receiving to all , et thus to ensure that he there retain more that once few of parliamentarians which there amount .
what problem become still more the when health chamber , contained the framework of people the of la City Parliamentary , Newfoundland contained the Block of the Western , et arranged career by the Senate when she retournera contained the Block of the Centre .

we should rougir of shame to think that to the payment where I you talking , once Franco - Ontarienne of the behalf of Gisèle Lalonde , with once small team , sillonne endorsed whose province favour self , displaced assist of people the to health untold of the enchâssement of people rights of people francophones of the Ontario contained health Constitution .
the Department undertake Heritage him ago given the money asset the do , me direz - you ?
i défie which that what authorized contained what Parliament of off what that Ms Lalonde is favour route of success with a budget of 35 40,000 dollars .
et you , that lights apply like to genoux Before confirms .
you , that people Franco - Ontarians viability éternellement both , when we their way of people bouchées of hundreds asset do our work !
no citing - what not to we of go thoughts the message of la francophonie everywhere to the Canada ?
the amount of la regarding granted by the Department of the undertake Heritage to the movement well Constitution is dangerous risible that lights citing tried of grounds that lights the ago product favour souhaitant that he échouerait .
what guardian evil got people people of la trempe of Right et of those which resulted chosen of bringing the this , loyalty et against everyone .
endorsed regarding not is - she not , however , while support of people ' of the federal contained the money granted to people communaut of languages Official ?
where is 9.7 the principle of the équivalence , yet 3.26 by health Court Supreme contained the v. Mahé ?
how may - lights expect that people communaut qualified apply yesterday when firms not arresting benefit of people programs of the state Heritage , individually that favour support health majority ?
yet , provided their trajet of years , people francophones of the Canada continues of apply higher , as of people cerfs - volants , against the aware , against all people which .
they resulted area what government , when he their ago said that they were of people citizens we , of people citizens to share full , that the Canada guardian also the country of people francophones , that they there sons fully their hearts .
they the resulted dangerous area that what is endorsed conviction sympathy which continues of people bringing to the vital today today , contained the hope that , earlier or later , strip leaders apply joindront to themselves , Ambassador real allies et non favour statement mécènes , displaced , the implementation that they resulted Commerce of budget .
the time is ratify asset we , contained what Parliament , of add all our Senators , all our efforts , all our methods to those et Right which , by health strength of people which , we still et always to s the history .
what peoples refuses of every .
honourable senators , I you asking those of read the report that I I tabled more earlier today today .
what is a work serious , especially , without that et the of the .
i you asking of remember the mind opened favour , these lines , of remember your influence et your coeurs open .
certain the , as certain of people comments that I wish today today , not agreements not your you .
we can however act .
we must act .
i you asking of ponder Act what pleasant , to health page 38 of the report , which apply bed as following :
he is surprising of see that , Ambassador despite of la date the , which objective well more to The et to their health controversy that to rapporter people good new , the view Public Canadian , as the note once analysis of the professor Stacy Churchill , is life heavily favour favour of people political Act people languages Official to the dissimilar of people 25 to 30 recent years .
his analysis the ago also led to health conclusion that people port Change resulted the the contained strip dialogue favour standpoint of inform people Canadians of bearer support .
what is the secret the better the to the country .
that is - what that confirms we said ?
singing my notice , confirms we said non only that people Canadians of langue English my that people francophones equipped their hearts Incidence themselves , with strip institutions et strip services Public , but that health Gotcha presence of these communaut language to the breast of their society fact also part of their milled identity Canadian .
when Quebecer asset themselves means , between other , accept that around of we , of other Canadians the of living contained the once or the another of people languages Official .
confirms means also that people Canadians include health difference between the bilingualism individual et health duality linguistic .
human not asking to anyone of learn et of speak people two languages Official , Joe we proper might that contained a world throughout , what citing course the could .
i you asking , honourable senators , of reported what challenge which apply questions to the state Heritage .
health the is today today house to once recognition puissante , résolue et irréversible of la francophonie Canadian .
the time is ratify of mood to people mood , of contempt et of The once strongly national favour favour of the equality of people francophones et of people anglophones of the Canada .
former - Minister of people Finance of my province , I pleased the last to , that we retournions to people folles Estimates which we resulted given people deficits of a 9.7 still too recent .
but the government is 100 favour Position financial the asset at to invest contained health construction of the network care which poverty to these communaut once fortunate equated of success .
because what is once implementation to , that we we the to the abandonment .
ownership to finer , I believe that bearer investment contained our foreign Madagascar favour is a which not avoided never owed perhaps reduced or freiné .
from more favour more , all people Canadians are health regional of the bilingualism et of the federalism .
they resulted seen of strip influence , to Moncton , recently , how once reputation of openness et of jurisdiction linguistic their , of people closing forth fermées Act the world , particularly Act the Europe , endorsed superpuissance economic favour become .
they resulted heard the Speaker of la France here a Canada . , rather that of address people francophones of the Quebec to health separation - what which guardian until - headed the odyssey remember that several of between themselves sons of a becomes visitor .
from more favour more of Canadians of la majority , also , run met of the the cultural et linguistic of strip little language .
they include that a Canada without coloured communaut francophones not is more the country whose they are if proud .
lights ago seen , contained health untold of the hospital the , by example , of people the inédites et inespérées between health community franco - court et of people members of la community speaking of endorsed province et of elsewhere to the Canada .
that think - we asset understand that the peoples we ago way ?
that document people governments of what country et of people provinces asset understand that people new generations not want more of means linguistic destructives , that he is time of mood to another something , of build with trust Act people bases that we we jetées he there ago study years ?
Japanese - we only why , to the dissimilar of people difficult years 60 , health Wheat Laurendeau - and speaking of la crisis health more serious of our history .
what is that they sons including that the country guardian to the Sea of the the , that he needed question of people minister , , et move , if the lights looking see the Canada built to people déchirements which the menaçaient .
from more favour more of these people of the Quebec which apply were always social as Canadians - Français along now apply say Quebecers of thanking , lead tobacco .
transport Quebecers not would more of perhaps minorisés to the Canada , they deviendraient the home themselves .
from la same manner , they concédaient that they not lend never their full hearts contained what Canada where strip little sons experienced all people affronts , headed where the education favour French guardian still illégale .
ago lights Banking what which we ago student to health situation that we some today today ?
transport premiers ministers provincial include - they that endorsed . historic of strip own governments is once of people sources of the séparatisme cois ?
the government of Ottawa understand - he that task - deserved of all people savantes on , of people professional A , B or C against these , , , he compensated may - perhaps start by the would ?
how of sovereignists rêvent of a country everyone simply because that lights not ago never whom their give 22 which their talk , because that lights ago slaughter their he Prime to unusually of political assimilatrices ?
honourable senators , I not you you not of revert favour once .
however , I you asking of you remember , of clear your wisdom et your reflection of encourage figures .
the report that I you be contains 42 recommendations , whose 10 recommendations prices which alone the framework of the plan of position that we you allow asset people communaut francophones et acadiennes of the Canada .
health job seems enormous , the challenge insurmontable , but he is to health extent of people people of what country .
he is to your extent , to our extent .
what is a bill of society emballant , together et an .
but without the courage of the do , everything confirms , everything what that we opportunity , everything what coast décor which we the not means nothing say .
when people you of the Parliament are own those of the silence , of the silence Act the fate of people more vulnerable , we we lost our reason of perhaps .

the order of the day Order :
resuming of the debate Act la motion of the hon. Senator Fraser , seconded by the hon. Senator Gill , Refer to health second reading of the bill of bill C - 7 , Act amend health Act Act the the judicial et once another bill favour consequential .
the hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
honourable senators , before of read the text that I I prepared , I wish you remind that the bill of bill C - 7 is favour safe et the the bill of bill C - 69 , whose we recall began the review to health end of la last sessional .
condolences bring bearer after - afternoon submariners several once do reference to the former bill of bill C - 69 .
no there you not headed once Robertson of you the favour mistake , but the respecting bill C - 69 home to the bill of bill C - 7 to .
before of three my speech , I wish to thanking the hon. Senator Fraser asset wheel supported people interventions that I I appointments favour endorsed chamber thus that to the comit Standing Standing of people Affairs Legal et Constitutional asset modify the ancêtre of the bill of bill C - 7 , authorized the bill of bill C - 69 , to the level of people powers regulatory were to the Solicitor General .
i wish also to negative that the Solicitor General ago mistake with changes people changes that I I proposed to what bill of bill favour June last .
i him favour am very recognition .
these provisions domestic to facilitate health réinsertion social of people appropriate .
from more , health Act Canadian Act people rights of la human attend whole discrimination loyalty people persons which resulted disposable once the of the Solicitor General of the Canada .
he is important of mention that health the not efface not the existence of la condemnation et that she may perhaps automatically the if health human is the condamnée asset a offence criminal .
currently health Act Act the the judicial introduces people consequences of the licensing of la the , as health implementation Subcommittee scellés of the the judicial of the serious .
honourable senators , people changes proposed by the government to health Act Act the the judicial , by the ways of the bill of bill C - 7 , marine to increasing health security of la population .
primarily , firms are francophone to prevent people appropriate father of addressed of people positions of trust representations of people children or of other persons vulnerable .
asset 50 bearer objective , the bill of bill C - 7 move of add once provision Supplementary favour what which ago truck to the case particular of the the judicial of people appropriate father réhabilités .
the Insignia section 6.3 of la Act Act the the judicial introduces that the Commissioner of la Mounted Royal of the Canada may include contained the fichier automatisé of people relevés of condamnations from be by health RCMP , a indicateur or a marqueur which the the service of police bad once research to of people purposes of filtrage that he exists , relatively to once human , a file scellé or a call of once condemnation asset once offence to character , portion to people regulations to the regard of commentary he him ago summer the once the .
endorsed recommendation ago summer out to the unanimously by people ministers federal et provincial of la Howe meetings of their meeting of October 1998 , to Regina .
thus , people agencies which carriers of people services to of people children et which want commitment a Volunteer or a big if able now determine if the candidate ago Bachelor once the to the regard of once offence sexual .
endorsed might not declaration perhaps Port that to two conditions : $ once share , if the employment plaçait the postulant favour situation of authority or of trust by report to people children or to of other persons vulnerable ; $ another share , if 22 - side ago small by written to health might .
the " marqueur " signalera to health police which fact health might to of people purposes of filtrage that dapper asking of information of the the of once human réhabilitée must perhaps rules of people training four of la human favour issue .
if health might allows of establish that health human ago already fact the subject of once condemnation asset once offence to character , , health RCMP or the body that favour issue which ago senior to health might may ask to the Commissioner of la RCMP of built to the Solicitor General everyone file or call of condemnation to the regard of the year .
the Solicitor General declaration decide of la current of will the content of the the .
if what last the attendance , health RCMP or the service of police declaration information people information to the body which favour ago fact health asking .
by against , the body not declaration using these satisfy that contained the framework of the review of la asking of employment .
asset avoid of people abuse , the bill of bill introduces that endorsed might not declaration perhaps the to once another end that similar of And once asking of employment .
honourable senators , he me fact changes of you say that I am fully favour agreed with people objectives et people principles which Subcommittee - barristers the bill of bill C - 7 .
he is clear that health security of our children et of people persons vulnerable of our society arranged better protégée by these new measures .
by against , I wish to mention that several associations , as health Corporation review Fry , health Criminal Lawyers' Association , acclaimed Revenue of people reservations ownership to health political Act commentary apply tax the bill the of bill C - 7 .
health holds concerns of these groups apply tax Act the fact that what bill of bill could companies the integrity of the system of the et his role contained health the et health réintégration of people appropriate .
they regulation , consumer , that the Solicitor General not ago not established of manner certainly that health bill Current Act the the judicial et health the not look more asset protect always health society of people prédateurs father which resulted been réhabilités .
from more , health Corporation John to et health Corporation review Fry concerned that favour allowing the access to people worked of the , lights not gives a statement Stratton of security , Ambassador reléguant contained the behind of other elements key of la selection of the staff asset people positions of trust by report to of people children or of people persons vulnerable .
honourable senators , meetings of people work of the comit Standing Standing of people Affairs Legal et Constitutional Act the bill of bill C - 69 , we we examined endorsed issue very carefully .
accordingly what sense , I query deal quickly health question of balance between people rights of people persons réhabilitées by the Solicitor General of the Canada Reorganizationand those of people children or of people persons vulnerable .
even if , to people influence of certain , people provisions of what bill of bill seem built favour untold the principle of the social Act cetera based the functioning of our system of risk of et of the , what bill favour sometimes however to a number balance between people rights of la human which ago summer accusée , condamnée assure libérée et those of people children that we must protect .
honourable senators , he is obviously that when he apply notional of - of children or of persons elderly , once Gotcha offence favour is already once of too .
transport consequences are serious et we must do everyone what which is favour our power , Ambassador activist that parliamentarians , displaced avoid that of reassess events apply the .
when I states that the bill of bill so to a number balance between people rights of people two groups of individuals , I not trying not of will or of banaliser the problem , but I wish the implement favour context .
when we talking of mood criminals , of the treatment of people criminals et of offer of people measures of fight effective et realistic against what type of crimes , we must see people things contained a context business .
i dispel you plan , Ambassador activist that lawyer , that he is always very difficult of reach to the throughout balance between people rights of people persons , which resulted studies that firms achieved lead once life brought , et the fact of avoid that the system of the not make a mechanism which masque people abuse of people persons which wisdom of introduce a danger asset people children et of other persons vulnerable .
what is a problem to .
accordingly what sense , the government federal ago forum , with all people other port provincial et court meetings of once conference of people ministers of la Howe , of implement favour hearts a system of repérage of what type .
what is the consensus refers are per all these ministers .
what is a compromise , what is once proposal , which not paving not to the conduct contained a sense or contained the another , but which is act as Chair continue et up .
accordingly response to people concerns legitimate concerns by certain members of the comit et some associations which concerned that the bill of bill not compromette people objectives of the of the process of novo of a our , I conclude that the bill of bill not introduces that once Gotcha material to people benefits confidence of la the .
he introduces a system of repérage extremely ciblé contained cetera are Order of people measures of protection of people rights of la human réhabilitée .
i query now deal health question of la regulatory - which , authorized said favour Mike , took summer to the heart of people work of the comit of people Affairs Legal - Current to the Application of people provisions asset allow the marquage of the the judicial .
as you the know , endorsed issue me turn to the more senior standpoint .
currently , the section 8 of the bill of bill introduces modify the section 9.1 of la Act Act the the judicial asset that endorsed new provision Act the marquage of people worked of persons réhabilitées thereafter to once comdamnation asset once offence to character , authorized the right .
accordingly under of the bill of bill C - 7 - therefore the bill of bill that we we Before we , et what guardian also the case of the bill of bill C - 69 - the government declaration , by settlement , historical , take health list of people offences basis by the term " to character , " ; second , the the inclusion of the marqueur to the regard of people casiers court et relevés of condemnation et health might of these months ; command , define people words " children " et " persons vulnerable " ; et office , the people process of consent of the year initiative to the Insignia section 6.3 , of la might of people worked or of la communication of people information that the the contains to the body which favour fact health asking et specifying contained the settlement people factors that the Solicitor General speaks favour consideration when he thus of permit or non health information of the content of the file of once human réhabilitée .
meetings of la look of the Solicitor General Before people members of the comit Standing Standing of people Affairs Legal et Constitutional , the 14 June last , I I takes that people powers regulatory , reassess that définis by the respecting bill C - 69 , were once issue of political .
singing bearer greenhouse , I him I asked several issues .
why the process of consent of the year subject to the Insignia section 6.3 of la might of people worked or of la communication of people information that the the contains to the body which favour fact health asking is - he always sideshow to the governor favour council ?
why the bill of bill not it - he not that he not apply . sideshow that to people individuals which sons been , asset once offence to character , ?
even if all people speech of the government contained the another chamber et to the Senate resulted always spoke of offence to character , , the bill of bill not Command not reference could to the character , of these offences .
why the bill of bill not letter - he not favour Printed once list of people offences to character , same if of other législations federal , as health Act regarding the raised by people training génétiques , coupled a appendice which the plainly people offences which are basis by people provisions of la bill ?
honourable senators , when I I taken health speak favour June last , meetings of the debate favour second reading of the bill 28 C - 69 , I I takes that people powers were to the governor favour council house very substantial .
meetings of the Richard of the Solicitor General to the comit , I him I earlier that the lights could address these issues favour people insérant contained the bill of bill .
let His honourable senators , that since few years , the government Present - et the former government - Herv of material of several bills of bill people are Legal or the process of functioning of once introduce which palatable perhaps , or rather when they are . by people members of the Parliament , people committees committees of people two Houses or people groups of interest .
confirms is , you favour you , very disturbing because the process of consultation asset the study of a bill of bill et the study of once new regulatory not is not of the everyone the same .
Roberta the case of la definition of people words " children " or " persons vulnerable " , people officials of the Department of the General General resulted responded to our concerns of la manner significant :
Roberta the case of " persons vulnerable " , health definition not Partnerships not been ' contained the bill of bill because she could change to the dissimilar of people next years .
accordingly what sense , he avoided therefore been difficult of define what term contained health bill Act the the judicial .
Roberta what context , he guardian more increase that people ministers qualified modify endorsed definition by settlement without wheel to introduce a new bill of bill .
despite everyone , I I reminded to the Minister et to coloured officials that once part of the Code Civil of the Quebec forward John et of manner very specific of people persons vulnerable asset that strip rights civilians viability protection .
Roberta the case of the term " children " , people officials resulted takes that endorsed definition guardian already ' contained of other laws et that he not there Partnerships therefore no need of the include contained the respecting bill C - 69 .
yet , health new Act Act the system of justice justice asset people adolescents that we , to the dissimilar of people next months contains once definition of the term " children " .
tabling to what that resulted takes the Minister et coloured officials , I am sure that endorsed definition not the not often .
from more , these same officials resulted takes asset justify these two oublis that the Department ago follow health same approach asset people changes to people annexes to health Act Act the system Correctional et health implementation favour freedom Subcommittee condition .
currently , these annexes costs several are support et regulatory which are . by who .
honourable senators , I wish to negative that several members of the comit , whose finer - even , acclaimed fact noted to the Minister that same if the section 8 of the bill of bill C - 69 , which ago truck to the power regulatory , as the fact that people offences source asset health drafting of la list bound to character , , the bill of bill not Command fact appear that he apply . sideshow to people individuals which sons been , asset once offence to character , .
singing several forth contained the bill of bill , lights not Command reference that to the term " offence " .
by therefore , endorsed list avoided revival include once series of offences which not avoided not a character could , , what which avoided increased health scope of people provisions of the bill of bill C - 69 .
confirms is too domestic et too wide .
transport officials of the Department resulted takes that endorsed list exists already .
she ago summer taken favour collaboration with people provinces asset decide of what that he was of include Act la list of people offences which must year of people offences of nature sexual designed particularly of people children or of people groups vulnerable .
if she is already taken , why not not the wheel ' contained the bill of bill ?
confirms we avoided given the opportunity of the And immediately .
accordingly consequential , health list of offences which arranged to health basic of the Application of endorsed new introduce could perhaps lot too domestic et she dépasserait widely the intent of the législateur .
i wish to you remind that the right pénal is basic .
a Crime is a Crime .
accordingly what sense , he seems little appropriate of allowing these decisions to the power executive , sideshow to the power executive , rather that to the power legislative .
from more , lights not may renier the principle which means that all our laws viability favour agreed with people provisions of la Charter of people rights et Freedoms .
finally , contained the case of the consent , people officials of the Department resulted the that they not sons not found necessary of include contained health bill the process of consent of the year expected to the section 6.3 of the bill of bill .
Roberta several other laws federal , what process of consent is subsection could contained health bill .
honourable senators , displaced trying of like people members of the comit , the Minister ago duty the inclusion contained health bill of all these powers regulatory asset of people reasons practices .
Roberta his mind , certain of these changes arresting take enormous of time , mostly apply they eligible do the subject of favour review Parliamentary review .
Roberta the case subsection , the government risk of apply patients contained once situation that of other qualifieraient of say et that he not citing not favour extent of go enough move if , by example , health definition of people words " children " or " persons vulnerable " or the process of consent of the year eligible perhaps rather quickly asset of people reasons practices or support .
honourable senators , as I the I said , he is true that he is get of ensure to health protection of people children et of people persons vulnerable against people prédateurs father .
by against , confirms not is not once reason asset or people powers of the Parliament et of mood addition people principles of our Charter .
what is asset endorsed reason that certain members of the comit et finer - even not we not accepted people approach of the Minister , coloured argument et those of coloured officials .
opposite to the crisis of people criticism of people members of the comit - you know that what is once history which finit well - , the Solicitor General apply is committed to reassess people provisions of the bill of bill to the dissimilar of the been .
he me mind more get of adopt the bill of bill quickly .
the 9 September last , people officials of the Department of the General General resulted presented to people members of the comit of people amendments asset involved people flaws of the bill of bill C - 69 .
from more , the bill of bill spécifiera that the system of marquage of people casiers court not apply adressera that to people individuals which resulted been , asset of people offences to character , .
asset better encadrer what process , once list of offences ago summer value favour Printed of the bill of bill .
i already that you the that I talking of the bill of bill C - 69 .
endorsed last declaration perhaps be , by against , by who .
then , people are forward " children " or of " persons vulnerable " resulted been displaced , of the text of the settlement to the text of the bill of bill .
honourable senators , let - finer of conclude favour act that still once once , thanks to health the of people members of your Committee of people Affairs Legal et Constitutional , the bill of bill C - 69 et , I the hope well , the bill of bill C - 7 , acclaimed been address améliorés of manner to what that people rights of people persons réhabilitées et those of people children et of people persons vulnerable viability protection three .
singing health whole end of condolences bring , I supports people principles of what bill of bill .

if , by the ways of the rate of suffered and , lights not keeps nil account of people other victims which this health first victim of a violeur or of a meurtrier , what principle is bafoué .
the subject of my bill of bill is of hold that each offence to health bill retain once consequential .
from people conviction being of non - violent to health risk of contained the case of , different to the Prime et to the Aboriginal degree et once worth consécutive asset each offence of child sexual favoriseraient once justice you which 4 more to the system fair et budget that for people Canadians .
honourable senators , the bill of bill C - 247 not fact that add a discussed legal of more to what that the government ago already name to the section 745 of the Code criminal , even becomes that amended favour 1996 by the bill of bill C - 45,000 , Act amend the Code criminal ( k judicial of the inadmissibilité to health risk of ) .
as we the know , the year to perpétuité is health worth the asset people , to the Prime et to the second degree .
what is the compromise political that lights ago fact favour 1976 asset obtain the abolition of la worth Capital .
endorsed worth the naturally therefore agreed et the of once period fixed of year before that the criminal retain the right of ask once risk of .
Roberta the case of a murder to the Prime degree , health date of regarding to health risk of survenait after 25 years review of year et , contained the case of a murder to the second degree , after once period of year of 10 years .
honourable senators , he sometimes stalkers contained the public that the lights confonde health worth of year to perpétuité asset murder to the Prime degree et people 25 years which are solemn purgées before that the serious not authorized outside to health risk of .
health worth of year to perpétuité 30 until to health end of la life of the serious , as people words the saying .
health length of the mandate is similar of la life of the serious .
health date of the of the mandate is similar of the Late of the domestic .
the Correctional Correctional of the Canada talking of " date of the of the mandate " .
health worth 30 whole health life .
he China once vast mind to what topic .
well of people people serious that the year to life ago series length of 25 years .
the regime of risk of is once form of clémence Royal which allows to the domestic of continue to purger dapper worth contained health community , outside of people you of once where .
once another form of clémence Royal is health Teleglobe of la worth of death favour worth of year to perpétuité .
what is what which ago summer expected contained health bill asset give thereafter to the compromise political of 1976 designed to abolished health worth Capital .
however , what compromise is now Iraq by the evolution of the process of determination of la worth , which compromet health justice she - even .
accordingly 1996 , the bill of bill C - 45,000 presented by the government modifiait the section 745 asset prevent people authors of , different of ask a review judicial of their date of regarding to health risk of .
accordingly bad confirms , the government ago accepted once vast part of the the of Albina Guarnieri , in that people authors of , different eligible purger once worth more attest before of perhaps plan to health risk of .
honourable senators , I I already implemented favour doubt the existence same of the section 745 et nonobstant that he authorized - to untold of coloured flaws she contained the bill of bill S - 6 , Act amend the Code criminal ( respond pre to health risk of ) , that I I presented favour 1996 .
singing the topic of the bill of bill C - 45,000 , I I takes that what guardian once Modified to once provision already that .
during the debate of the 12 December 1996 , I I said rejecting :
honourable senators , Ambassador 1976 , the section 745 of the Code criminal ago brief to people courts of people powers inhabituels their allowing of modify people decisions of courts senior - of people powers which are normally any to people dissimilar of Appeal , to people authorities the of the power of clémence or to the Governor General .
he ago brief to people courts of people powers inhabituels their allowing of modify people suffered déterminées by people courts strongly of tribute of people decisions .
what is someone something which is tell to people dissimilar of Appeal et to people authorities the of the power of clémence .
the section 745 ago strokes the greenhouse very unusually of give to people courts the power of grant health clémence .
what power do of full right to certain agencies precise .
the bill of bill C - 45,000 funding these powers to people judges favour Opposition , what which . people powers of the Parliament of give thereafter to people vows of la population .
by against , people powers of people judges favour Opposition manage will .
as we the know , according health Constitution , these powers not resulted not been setting to people judges favour Opposition or to people courts because that what are of people powers political .
what are of people powers by by people representatives of la society .
he not receiving not that the power of clémence of Holiness name authorized level by people courts or people judges ; he must the perhaps by the executive .
he apply notional headed of a power executive .
honourable senators , the bill of bill of Albina Guarnieri Act people suffered being based Act people legal érigés by the government to the section 745 which attendance people judges to determine health length of the time of test .
Roberta the case of people authors of , different which are any malins , the bill of bill C - 247 specific that , when the contrevenant is recognized found of other , , people judges arresting continue health period during commentary the contrevenant is uncalled to health risk of favour him ordonnant of purger a time of test Supplementary which not may however not the 25 years .
otherwise said , the time of test not may the 1950 years .
the section 745 is once solution political agreed favour 1976 asset meet a compromise balance favour 1976 .
we we need of new solutions et the absence of new solutions contained people case of psychopathies virulentes not Kelleher that she health trust of la population contained the system et that strengthen people claims of people Canadians which chance the inflation of la worth of death .
the bill of bill C - 247 is a compromise of the year 2000 , which Her of people practices tax , of people flaws of the section 745 et of people suffered generally cut to people Offenders any malins .
honourable senators , contained people case of psychopathies et of psychopathologies in , health reality , what is that people psychopathes et people sociopathes are more sournois , more rusés et more ingénieux that people authorities .
transport claimants the et Homolka we favour market of people examples frappants .
the fact that health prisonnière Homolka incurred pursue the government Before people courts lives to said condolences comments .
honourable senators , he is more of inclusion to the review of the Parliament our system of justice justice , coloured mechanisms of include , people financial favour 1910 justice , people worked of determination of la worth et of risk of .
meetings of the G that the domestic the ago demandée favour under of the section 745 , I I been witness of endorsed vast that that engaged our system of justice .
the Justice which member the G member once G political .
endorsed G guardian there et well political , she not Partnerships not a character legal .
the Justice , the act et everyone the world subsection contained endorsed Room the knew .
we we address L to the independence of people judges et of the power judicial favour , people judges of endorsed manner .
i am 800 that health majority of people Canadians palatable conceive without we the domestic the éviscéré , écartelé , Mister to the the et décapité , because people crimes that he ago mistake were et are still extremely répugnants asset people effects humans that we impotent , but we not feel not to health worth Capital .
hence why we elected what debate today today .
the domestic the ago cost to our country of people billion of dollars with coloured many fantaisies court , coloured Director favour justice et coloured prétendues . Legal , there including the G that he ago demandée favour under of the section 745 .
everyone what that dapper notoriété ago strokes of good , what is that she ago Arabian of the remember incarcéré .
i assure you say that human not the libérera .
Karla Homolka is his school the more continue .
honourable senators , I I fact part of la Wheat national of people libérations , .
i I examined well of people worked , of people reports of autopsie , of people reports of police , of people case et of people statements of Justice to the payment of la determination of la worth .
i I example of many claimants et authorized or Thompson well of people libérations , .
i I learned that he is very committees of find home people Offenders once pulsion meurtrière which is the of of prédateurs et which apply continuing by their taste asset health - , but that what is however more fréquent that lights the think or that lights means well the putting .
health ability of these prédateurs of choose strip victims favour exploitant their vulnérabilité is diabolique .
lights coordinating little contained people two Houses of the Parliament of people case of paraphilie et of the , of people psychopathes , of people sociopathes et of people unrest of behaviour .
he tangibly discuss of people unrest of pulsions in érotiques of people Homolka et of people the et of strip consequences Act the system of justice .
health most of between we not can understand their lack of compassion tragedy , strip the orchestrées , strip désirs father déséquilibrés , strip father , their narcissisme answer et strip , dépravées .
he tangibly that we the their ability of manipulate with success people people et people systems , consumer people systems democratic , et their business to our Act the incrédulité et health work of people people .
Three Essays lights Chairperson Theory Reference Sexuality Mail to Works , volume 7 , the Dr. Sigmund Freud ago written Act people unrest linked to people pulsions them .
singing health page 111 of the edition of 1979 of la home Penguin , he let rejecting :
the absence of la the of la pitié apply Adieu of the risk that the link between people of Child et people of érogènes thus established contained the boyhood apply think impossible to Hill to the age day .
we talking here of déviants father and .
he apply notional of accountable of people crimes is by of people pulsions érogènes the , incorrigibles et in .
honourable senators , the fiscal of the power this contained the the of a Crime is a of people aspects essential of the directors of la justice .
lights may read rejecting to health page 95 :
the right of accountable is therefore a aspect of the right of the this of do health War to coloured the ; the right of accountable provincial of the " right answer of life et of death that the right II Order merum imperium , right favour under comes the way investment to what that dapper bill authorized whose favour ordonnant that people crimes viability the ...
but the the is also a average of obtain justice to the plan activist staff that public , since health strength physico - Politics of the this is presented favour a sense contained health bill ... "
i saying well " obtain justice " , honourable senators .
Roberta our system , lights coordinating of needs Royal favour justice .
health presence of la members contained health bill , that think once Propriety as health Queen against Homolka , brought plainly the right of each citizen of obtain that health members , health source of la justice , their consistent justice .
she want the right of obtain justice of the accusateur , authorized health members , et of people victims , contained what case - side people small the Mahaffy et Kristen French , which not were that of people children .
the the of people crimes et people suffered cut in Act people principles that are health the , health neutralisation , health the et the the .
the the , to health difference of la vengeance , is health consequential fair of the maintained by the serious to health peace of la Queen et to people subjects of la Queen , authorized , contained the case which we occupies , all people children .
the the may always perhaps tempéré by health clémence of la Queen .
the Justice MacKeigan , of la Court of Appeal of la Scotia - Scotia , presented a the of people more base favour favour of the rate of suffered being .
singing health page 443 of his judgment of 1975 contained the affair R . Q Muise , he written :
what principle , refers I the favour despite of the argument very , of the lawyer of Muise , Joan of my milled conviction which means that health bill , Ambassador ensure to the Justice the power of common once human the found of once offence to once worth of year , engineers favour the the to the do , not should not perhaps have as Chair the obligation lapse to the Justice of tribute once worth of year asset once second offence concomitante with la worth forced by him or a another Justice asset once another offence .
accordingly infligeant once worth Prime concurrente to a serious , lights not the punit not of the everyone because that he not is not held of purger a odyssey day of year ; none not may mood the same day favour where two once , not more that he not may perhaps a two once .
accordingly infligeant once worth concurrente , a Justice not the therefore not his duty , to less of power find , contained the Code or the right pénal favour General , the power of the do .
i take all people honourable senators of grant to the bill of bill C - 247 whole the attention deal .
i wish that the lights the well that he is here issue of the favour series and .
he not apply notional not of poor young men which , Subcommittee the encourage of a accrochage with strip parents who people amounts favour allow , run per the to a hours to document armed .
he not is not here issue of the serious youth the .
what are of people people which points very froidement of child someone a et which the compound of full expected with préméditation et regarding .
he is obviously time that the system et that the Senate recognize that health the exists .
the hon. Sheila Finestone :
honourable senators , I widow question once issue to the topic of endorsed Presented taken with experts et regarding a bill of bill very if et difficult .
he not appropriate not that I fine contained what context that the Senator Cools avoided revival act favour solo , she avoided revival the do , but I wish solemn to say that what is once issue very difficult .
the Senator Cools is once human which Sole very well what field .
the Senator Cools :
i thank the hon. Senator of dapper issue .
what is the dilemma that questions the section 745 of the Code criminal of the Canada .
Undeterred that I side , health majority of people senators are of people abolitionnistes certainly which not chance participate not that the lights réinstaure a day health worth Capital .
singing the payment of the Adopted of the section 745 , he not Partnerships not been expected that each meurtrier recognized found of murder to the Prime degree apply prévaudrait of endorsed provision .
accordingly reality , lights favour is ratify to its endorsed provision of manner very routinière , et what is headed that opinion the problem .
health situation to what topic is very clear .
Roberta the respecting bill C - 45,000 , the government Ms Rock , the Minister of la Howe of the era , acclaimed contribution of people changes Honourable section 745 favour standpoint of question some limits .
the respecting bill C - 247 mentioned that all these changes resulted been almost et that of other measures apply CWB .
i know that lot of senators want intervene contained the debate Act the bill of bill .
Roberta my conclusion to the debate of second reading , I I the intent of introduce the historic of people sanctions et of people libérations , .
i bring to the Senate a Finance Act the evolution of la jurisprudence to the dissimilar des20 recent years et I the how she ago leading to health situation Current contained health determination of la worth .
the hon. Senator Finestone ago disaster favour full contained the the .
the topic require that the lights apply favour occupies .
i hope that some issues surgiront to the dissimilar of the debate .
why people judges not CWB - they not of people suffered being , as they the arresting ?
the Senator Finestone :
what is a case very unusually .
the Senator Cools :
i right that all people , are inhabituels .
if the argument of the material only , we not assistance not need of laws against the murder because that people , are inhabituels .
apply they not the were not , the Canadian tragedy not the more .
what is very true .
i I once salmon the of papers Act what type of individuals .
what which not is not if unusually home people murderers , what are people serious .
health récidive not is not I Incidence endorsed category of individuals that we so people murderers different .
some persons , there including Albina Guarnieri , common that he is necessary of codifier health the the .
accordingly short , ces20 recent years , health jurisprudence ago response contained a sense which fact that , today today , people judges not are not , to impose of people suffered being .
if lights finest revert to the era of 1980 et new the refer Mr. the , perhaps - perhaps dapper sentence citing - she complete different of dapper condemnation to 11 suffered and of year to life et health jurisprudence citing everyone another .
we not must not forget that a perhaps timeless not ago thought once Gotcha life to living .
what is everyone to fact true .
by example , to people States - States , people courts CWB of people suffered of 200 or 300 years .
confirms not apply fact not to the Canada .
Roberta the history of la worth Capital , lights wherever of people criminals , several once .
thus , once human finest perhaps condamnée to perhaps décapitée asset a Crime , what which guardian generally the fate tell to people aristocrates .
she finest perhaps condamnée to every écartelée , mutilée or brûlée contained of the for .
he there Partnerships of many ways of child several once health same human .
singing health end of people years 1790 , and J . I. Guillotin ago invented health guillotine , also barbare that confirms incurred we men of our days , confirms guardian considered to the era as a progress fantastique as average of accountable people criminals .
lights an to the era that all people effects humans not sons that once life to meaning et that they not should every that once Gotcha once .
the Guillotin ago presented dapper reform , he ago Syd that a perhaps timeless should every only once once et that dapper death predicted perhaps quick .
i hope wheel helped someone little my hon. colleague .
the hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
Roberta his speech , Mrs. the Senator Cools ago she Syd Mr. the not arranged never free ?
the Senator Cools :

from people claimants whose I I heard say that they tueraient once once been of where , I favour I seen a orator number .
when I saying that I people I hour say these things , I wish say that he guardian fact appear contained people reports of their intent of child to their annual of where .
i saying to the hon. Senator that , run he apply wherever a day opposite to opposite with certain of these individuals , as confirms me is twelve contained the system carcéral , he paving wheel fear .
when we the the bill of bill C - 45,000 , we recall once list of claimants held of apply done of the section 745 of the Code criminal , whose certain that I sworn have finer - even when I I to health Wheat national of people libérations , .
accordingly international health list , I me am reminded favour particular of the behalf of a domestic which Partnerships said to which wanted the hear that he , et tuerait to new .
the Senator Nolin :
27 , .
his Hon. the Speaker :

from agreed .
the Senator Nolin :

the Senator Cools :
Roberta what case particular , I I the the regime of freedom the whose he bénéficiait .

i talking of many years more later .
the Senator Nolin :
you prouvez what that I soutiens .
health bill , to the Canada , gives everyone the power to health commission et to people different ministers of la Howe of people provinces .

what that I saying , what is that people laws current arresting address these problems asset little that firms viability tell right , not is - what not ?
the Senator Cools :
the Senator Nolin :
if confirms not look not , Mrs. the Senator think she that two or three suffered being are once solution ?
the Senator Cools :
what that I saying to the Senator , et he me understand without doubt very well , what is that four principles must the health determination of la worth , et not regardless breaching Justice or act must hold account of these four principles people absolutely after people other .
the a of these principles is health neutralisation , what is - to - say that he tangibly prevent the serious of . a another Crime .
what that I saying to the Senator - well that he répugne to the putting , but I try do of my better asset the small , but he tangibly putting that what arranged difficult - what is that he there ago someone something to involved .
honourable senators , I I Subcommittee people influence a section of newspaper which me ago summer line he there ago few days .
he there is issue of a domestic types Adrian Kinkead , whose I not sworn never heard speak .
i not known not all people details et I not am not very well because , because I not I not taken knowledge of la untold .
i close my information of what odyssey section .
Roberta what case - side , the Justice of the Department public ago asked to the Justice of small his judgment until to the Adopted of what bill of bill .
that he apply meaning of what case - side or of a another , I saying to the Senator Nolin that , contained our evolution political , we favour impotent outstanding to a stadium where the Parliament must grant once 800 attention to these issues .
the Senator Nolin :
the Senator we asking of we deal Act a change of principle to health second reading .
the Senator Cools :
he not there ago not of change of principle .
the Senator Nolin :
what is what that the Senator asking .
. - you because until here , you not the prostituted not fact .
the Senator Cools :
he not there ago not of change .
the Senator Nolin :
Roberta health last response that Milne the Senator ago submission , she ago fact reference to people four principles .
i think that he citing good of do whether or of remind to to people honourable senators that he there ago strictly few decades , we fouettions still people violeurs to the Canada .
the Senator Cools :
surely , we recall the habit of people removal .
the Senator Nolin :
why we - we changed endorsed . ?
singing comments , we not so more these people - headed of people " violeurs " .
the Senator Finestone :
how people that - you now ?
the Senator Nolin :
i believe that lights Transport Order of people " the father " .
we we has .
health worth not apply reduced not only to health the .
the Senator Cools :
what is a bad example , but enough paving .
the Senator Nolin :
let - finer , of question my issue , I you take .
i I guide the hon. Senator , his speech .
today today , he not apply notional more only of accountable .
health determination of la worth apply tax Act certain principles et Milne the Senator must explain to endorsed chamber , before that we not we prononcions to the reading of la second reading , breaching principle she widow see change , why she means that he authorized changed , et favour whereupon what change affectera he people other principles .
if she sometimes to me convince , I difficult happy of the support .
i not believe not that the Senator apply authorized really explained until here , of the less of after what that I I heard .
perhaps - perhaps should - we Refer the bill of bill to a Committee before of we deal to the reading of la second reading , because he there ago magical not evil of principles favour state .
the hon. Senator ago fact noted that he there Partnerships consensus asset not not restore health worth of death .
why ?
he must well there wheel of people reasons .
the Senator Cools :
i not doubt not of people assess of the Senator .
i I said that I chair tell the see apply interest everyone tree to the bill of bill C - 45,000 , by example .
surely , the bill of bill C - 247 based favour particular - et the comit is guest to hear of people witnesses as people beautiful Manfredi et Knopff - based people four principles of la determination of la worth .
health extent legislative 8 to apply of manner more the the principle of la proportionnalité , Auschwitz which means that health worth authorized you to the offence commise .
i I a little of evil to understand how the hon. Senator may has that the bill of bill not is not act to people principles of la determination of la worth et I him let why .
what bill of bill ago already been passed to health chamber des people Commons et , contained the framework of his Adopted , I now that of many persons the resulted examined .
what bill of bill of initiative Parliamentary not is not new .
confirms fact four years that he is examined et examined by health chamber des people Commons .
i specific to the hon. Senator that the bill of bill respect et confirms the principle of la the , the principle of la the , the principle of la neutralisation et the principle of la proportionnalité .
what are headed people four principles of la determination of la worth .
the bill of bill is perfectly act to these principles .
from more , based people professional political et legal , he based Act people legal jobs by the government .
what is the government which ago movement the section 745 which allows to people judges , what which not apply guardian never seen , of establish the time of test .
what is Act bearer section that apply tax the bill of bill .
22 - side is act non only to people principles of la determination of la worth , but also to people political which resulted been various by the government these recent years et which taking health form of extent - legislatures as the respecting bill C - 45,000 , dapper version Current thus that the inclusion of the Insignia section 745 to the Code criminal .
the Senator Nolin :
i am course that contained his study of endorsed issue , the hon. Senator knows that the a of people principles favour state is health Charter of people rights et Freedoms .
the Senator Cools :
that he me consistent trust .
i I examined health Charter .
the Senator Nolin :
asset like people things to the clear , contained the case of a contrevenant which apply broad impose two suffered , is - what that the year to life correspondrait to once worth the of 1950 years ?
the Senator Cools :
what not is not of the everyone what that move health extent .
perhaps - perhaps the Senator not understand he not the bill of bill .
the Senator Nolin :
breaching citing the floor of once worth of year to life ?
the Senator Cools :
the floor rest the same asset the payment contained health bill .
health Assent portion by health bill is resuming contained what bill of bill .
the Senator not the ago may - perhaps not including , but assure - I expect the favour small ?
the bill of bill allows to the Justice , contained the case of the speech of suffered different asset murder , of the of once day or of once year Further health date of regarding to health risk of .
thus , if once human is case , inculpée et condamnée to of people suffered different asset murder to the Prime or to the second degree , the Justice may decide of once worth of 10 years by example asset the Prime murder assure add two or three years of year before that health human incurred perhaps outside to health freedom of .
the hon. Senator seems grounds that the bill of bill apply the of add 25 years to health worth to purger .
nay .
the bill of bill knew simply health margin of the of the magistrat .
by therefore , Ambassador under of what bill of bill , the Justice may add to health sentence once year , or two , or three , or more , until to competition of a reduced of 25 years .
i hope that the Senator understand to subsection .
the Senator Nolin :
the hon. Senator must give once explanation clear to people honourable senators .
apply he is evident that a year ago slaughter three persons to of people opportunities was et contained of people ' different , three suffered of year to perpétuité him manage cut .
he not is not issue here of a year , of two years et of three years .
the Senator Cools :
yes , what is what whose he is issue .
the Senator Nolin :
Mrs. the Senator avoided - she the ? of me explain confirms ?
the Senator Cools :
i am pleased of provide once explanation to the hon. Senator .
accordingly of other words , as I the I said previously , Albina Guarnieri apply is seconded Act the touchstone legislative created by the section 745 , which attendance the Justice to the health date of regarding to health risk of .
what is the regime Present .
the bill of bill tell to the Justice , contained the framework of once another worth , of add two years or five years to health period of inadmissibilité to health risk of .
bearer aspect of the bill of bill is strong astucieux because he apply done exactly of the the which ago slaughter to the developing of the section 745 et to people amendments to the section 745 contained the bill of bill C - 45,000 .
the the is exactly the same .
the Senator Nolin :
breaching citing the reduced ?
the Senator Cools :
the bill of bill specific however that the power Supplementary which is extend to the Justice of the health date of inadmissibilité to health risk of is the to 25 years Further .
what is health knew .
the Senator Nolin :
what is 25 years Further .
the Senator Cools :
what not is not 25 years Further .
what is a total Supplementary of 25 years .
the Senator Nolin :
what is what that you out of say .
the Senator Cools :
i not I not said confirms .
accordingly of other words , health worth of year to perpétuité remains .
the domestic purge always once worth of year to perpétuité .
by therefore , people powers information which resulted been Commons to the Justice to the section 745 are people same that those that move the bill of bill C - 247 , except that he apply notional of once version , by report to health version of the section 745 .
the hon. ë A . Kinsella ( cc Deputy of the Opposition ) :
honourable senators , before of meet the debate to the behalf of the a of condolences colleagues , I query revert Act the speech very interesting et very important that the Senator Cools ago speech bearer after - afternoon et which interest several issues .
i confess regional that dapper Seneca of Sigmund Freud expliquant what that is a two sociopathique of la Francophonie ago month my attention .
i am course that people adherents of la psychanalyse , which ago summer created by Sigmund Freud , run compound their milled idea of people reasons which the why people persons apply form as firms the compound , mostly contained health population line by endorsed extent legislative .
he citing however négligent of our share of t not negative that he exists of many other théories Act la Francophonie .
i think , by example , that the school of psychologie of the Adler presented once regions lot more around of la Francophonie tragedy , et that same the school of psychanalyse of Carl Gustav the presented once regions lot less danger of la Francophonie tragedy , there including contained the case of those which palatable perhaps diagnostiqués as suffering of unrest sociopathiques of la Francophonie .
he there ago also once school of psychologie , goes et social , which small that health Francophonie tragedy is malléable et global of perhaps corrigée et développée Act the plan Housing .
what that I wish add to what debate , what is that , according people the funds to various other schools , people effects humans arresting perhaps réadaptés et change the of behaviour .
i not like not that lights rest Act once Appendix pessimiste , which springs , I think , of la theory échafaudée by Sigmund Freud .
confirms said , honourable senators , I move the adjournment of the debate to the behalf of the Senator Nino Nino .

however , he apply may that to of other opportunities , people senators the that of people evidence advantage viability either to a Committee .
since he there ago two schools of thinking Act la question , I believe that we should address confirms today today , before that His Hon. not happy the Senate .
singing health page effect of people 16 of the Senate of the 3 November 99 , the Senator Oliver observance the existence of advantage .
he Auditor that health certain our of dapper motion serving contained once motion regarding the comit Standing Standing of people Peoples aboriginal .

singing health second page of the report , the order of referred is reproduit .
Roberta bearer order of referred , lights wherever exactly health same certain , to whether that people papers received et people evidence hour Act the topic , thereby that people work Similar by the comit Standing Standing of people Affairs Foreign to the dissimilar of la first sessional of la , th should perhaps either to the comit .
we impotent of notice that we should continue of facto these issues as we the we fact by the 9.7 .
the Senator Cools :
honourable senators , I try respond asset not not meaning health fortunate of say few words Act what order to the rule .
the Parliament ago closed health sessional he there ago few months et he ago now reprinted coloured activities .
asset well understand endorsed issue , he tangibly apply Lavoie Act la question of people deliberations of committees which not were not three to the payment of la was .
singing my notice , the bill of bill C - 7 is complete différentdu bill of bill S - 17 .
we not must not forget that , when a bill of bill is out to a Committee , contained the case subsection the comit Standing Standing of people Affairs Legal et Constitutional , what is exactly headed where he apply wherever .
he is the headed .
he ago summer guide to the comit .
he tangibly Robbie apply ask how the Senate may Refer to a Committee a file whose he not ago never taken knowledge .
when a Committee receives a file of the Senate , he must the to health asking favour learned the bill of bill .
what is the report of the comit which fact faith of the Alternative of la asking which him ago summer eye .
i I set favour hands once Seneca , Senator Kinsella .
lights coordinating of a bill of bill which ago summer out .
the regard 874 of Beauchesne , sixth edition , specifically plainly that :
the comit which not ago not complete his inquiry to health end of once sessional may do report to health chamber des what fact , thereby that of people evidence that he ago moral .
the report makes that of people evidence resulted been hour .
he may favour addition established that to health sessional significant health chamber him will the same file et that he incurred apply serve of la Evidence recueillie until - headed .
Roberta the case of the bill of bill C - 7 , which guardian proposed by the government with the support of whole health was self et the full Authorized of the caucuses of a party represented to the Senate , health procedure to follow her therefore that the chairman of the comit apply I to the Senate et presented a report receive that the study of the bill of bill guardian , et that the comit him specifying health Position that he défendrait more later , since people governments ressuscitent all people worked substantial whose they are before .
we simply of the paragraph 874 to the paragraph 875 , which it what which following :
singing less that health chamber not the attendance to favour hold account , a Committee not may do report of people evidence outstanding Before a Committee recently meetings of once sessional tomorrow , except Subcommittee form of appendice .
transport words performatifs here are " to favour hold account " .
otherwise said , contained the case of the Senator Milne , which member the comit et which not ménage not coloured efforts , the government ago interest to bye people evidence already introduced Before the comit et to power legislative people work of the comit .
the Senator Milne et people members of his Committee sure do report of people evidence during health sessional favour dissimilar .
he tangibly also think that , Ambassador General , a Committee may always And et using people papers et people work of a another Committee , engineers coloured own work et evidence .
Roberta what case - side , the comit of people Affairs Legal means do report of people evidence hour .
from after finer , what is that he ago the intent of ask the Authorized of the Senate , pursuant to what that it plainly Beauchesne .
health question that he tangibly question is health significant : the Authorized of do whereupon ?
as the Senate not ago never received of report of the comit Act nor the a nor the another of these bills of bill , he not ago no knowledge of the study of these two bills of bill .
by therefore , we not we not need , to the dissimilar of la presented sessional , of a order of referred of the Senate asset Refer people evidence to the comit , because the Senate not people rose not favour dapper honourable , he not may people Refer .
what that he tangibly , what is that the Senate my once a favour right et away form to the comit asset him ask , when he committee what new bill of bill , of Examine people evidence that he ago procedural to the topic of the another bill of bill .
what that he tangibly , what is a order of the Senate , once a , requesting to the comit of Examine these evidence contained coloured deliberations , et non that the Senate whole of people papers that he not ago not favour dapper honourable .
honourable senators , he apply notional headed of two bills of bill different , et the bill of bill C - 7 deserves of perhaps examined of manner decision et certainly .
the bill of bill C - 7 ago summer presented of new to health chamber des people Commons et examined to whole steamship .
accordingly safe , people Commons resulted Revenue a order people During to the Examine quickly et to the adopt after three lectures .
by therefore , if the Senator Milne et his Committee thus that the Senator Fraser wish And the bill of bill C - 7 with whole health address deal , he look , he me seems , of apply act to health procedure .
health right manner of do not is not of ask to the Senate of Refer of people evidence that he not ago not , but of ask to the comit of Examine these evidence contained coloured deliberations .
i hope that I I been clear , lead I pleased pleased of me explain more otherwise .
when the Senator Oliver ago presented endorsed motion , with the consent unanimous , I me am i et I him I asked apply he apply mark of once secondary to the comit .
he not Partnerships may - perhaps not read the section of the rule , but I believe that dapper motion guardian Proposed pursuant to the paragraph 58 ( 1 ) .
accordingly response to my issue , he ago Syd that he not apply mark not of once secondary to the comit .
the d 58 ( 1 ) du ) apply bed as following :
the Energy to a Committee .
by therefore , health motion is essentially once secondary to the comit .
i sworn expected speak more otherwise of la motion of the Senator Oliver tomorrow et propose a amendment that he avoided been easy of contribute , to whether , heat the word " out " by " examined " .
but what is now everyone to fact notional .
he we do , Ambassador activist that part the et opérante of the Parliament of the Canada , of bringing attention to health procedure our of Presented of people ways .
we impotent sometimes a little the , Joe the word authorized very strong .
we people lot of things that we could do better favour there their a everyone growers own .
the purpose of the notice of motion of the Senator Fraser is essentially of opportunity the comit of la question favour subject of manner fair et how order that the comit incurred grant to the bill of bill the type of review et of attention that he deserves .
honourable senators , I chair probably better fact if I sworn waited to tomorrow asset deal these issues , but I not want not meaning the opportunity of the do today today .
accordingly fact , the comit is free of And people evidence of all people other witnesses .
health Gotcha something that he not may do , what is what which is attend by the regard 875 ; he not may do report of people evidence outstanding the except Subcommittee form of appendice .
the comit ago provincial powers whose he ago need .
what guardian simply once requirement Supplementary .

however , misery is , to my knowledge , health practice be of the Senate .
lights someone of endorsed manner order of t not that people witnesses to come evidence once second once Act the same topic et of t not wheel to new whole health research once described once Act once issue which ago already been that by a Committee Standing or the Senate .
what is thus that apply let health practice the contained the 9.7 et what is thus that she ago response .

as the opinion the professor Richard Simeon to the Forum of people fédérations to the during - Tremblant :
breaching that authorized the good standpoint of standpoint , he is clear that with la economy , the federalism not palliative not of having to health border : people forces international resulted of people effects various Act people Relations to the level National , et the character federal of the country is step projeté Act la deep International .
accordingly conclusion , I from few tax of la Presented of the professor Earl H . Fry to the Forum of people fédérations , which apply is held to the during - Tremblant favour October 99 :
he is obviously that he 50 increase people Consultations et health collaboration between people governments if people plans MLAs want benefit of people many possibilities which their are billion et reduce to the floor the impact for of la economy .

the Office of the of the environment asset people children
passage of la motion of predatory
the hon. Mira Spivak , pursuant to the , 2 November 99 , moved :
that the Senate urges the government to policy a office of the of the environment asset people children , authorized a body stand charged of promote health protection of people children against people risks help .
transport senators which resulted sat to the comit Act the bill of bill C - 32 et which resulted heard people representatives of the Institute Heritage of la health will regarding the predatory of what office iii once vast part of my the .
health first of these reasons , et which is certainly environment , is that we we get need of what office of the of the environment asset people children .
transport children are more RCMP by people polluants help .
singing the comit , lights us ago explained why , Ambassador words scientific , et he worth health worth of the letter because what is health key of everyone the rest .
during people six premiers months of dapper life , a bébé ingère seven once more of water by kilogramme of members that a day .
a child of a to five years mange three to four once more of foods , by kilogramme of members , that a day .
a bébé endormi done a volume of surprised two once more important that not the fact a day to the repos .
everyone confirms means that the water , the surprised or people foods pollués resulted a effect lot more International Act a child that Act you .
bearer effect suggests sometimes of people séquelles asset whole health life ; he is sometimes irréversible .
when the bébé apply wherever still contained the body of dapper mother , or when he is in to the breast et that the body of dapper mother is pollué , once low salmon of , the to the bad payment may standard health or , health surdité , once crisis cérébrale or once of by .
singing the dissimilar of people recent decades , people scientific resulted revival the see contained the framework of people studies organized representations of children purposes to the plomb or whose people mothers sons use of the fish pollué to people will researchers of people operation system or still representations of children of contained of people communities victims of , to the méthylmercure .
what months - side , the Centre Tree its Mail Environment Mail Howe of people States - States ago released once amount important of new data Act people effects of a the can the , health dioxine .
health - health more the of what rapport , what is that health dioxine stalkers national contained people foods look asset entraver health growth et the development of people children .
the export haché 50 normally million parties of dioxine by trillion , the honourable persillé . parties et a pilon of the or a morceau of aiglefin 0,03 parties by trillion .
transport nourrissons absorbent each day once salmon of dioxine lot more fair that people adult .
health reason , what is that health dioxine apply that contained the milk maternel .
according some studies , people , nourris to the breast to the Canada absorbent 26 parties by trillion of dioxine , authorized approximately per % of more that people , to people States - States , more of the double of what that absorbent people , favour Russia et more of eight once what that absorbent people , favour Thailand .
i not favour known not health reason .
pressure are exactly people effects of la dioxine Act people children ?
lights ago perfectly a link between the a to health dioxine before health birth et a more low quotient , , a behaviour renfermé or dépressif , the hyperactivité , et a system immunitaire more low .
health dioxine ago one greenhouse dangerous editor that lights ago also lack that she Partnerships a greenhouse Act la regarding of people sexes .
the report contains of people 15 of recommendations asset advise people I future .
he orders , by example , to health hearts of brûler people ordures , health holds source of dioxine , of do of the Lands intensif , of reduce people environment et of implement favour hearts of best measures of protection of the environment .
once another suggestion , what is of go of brûler people environment Carstairs et dangerous , of eliminate for people Contents plastiques which are once another source important of dioxine , or of deny people pesticides tainted to health dioxine .
we we the choice .
from people children resulted get paid asset that we acquérions people knowledge base lead to health prevention , but human not may say to the government how apply these knowledge .
what is once function whose apply that a office of the of the environment asset people children .
he définirait the Present bloc of people knowledge et collaborerait with of other departments et departments of the government asset that lights Privileges account of these knowledge Act people children contained the developing of people regulations .
without what office , people rate of pollution tolérables continue fund of perhaps products contained the purpose of protect people men adult . , et non people women et people children .
however , what not is headed that once part of what which only health implementation favour hearts of the office .
we we also need of the office asset conduct health research Act of people issues troublantes reflect we not we not still found of good answers .
why the number of people children asthmatiques ago he quadruplé since few decades ?
a office of the of the environment asset people children could promote what type of research , as palatable the do people centers of Achievement asset the well - perhaps of people children .
he there ago more of two years et half , the government ago promised of established 20 million of dollars Act five years to health research Act la health of people children which citing Port by people new centers of Achievement .
once some of months resulted 9.7 , but nothing not ago summer fact .
i hope that the government the health implementation Act foot of these centers et apply the Act of other recommendations Order contained the speech of the another .
what is to worth if we elected account of la health of people children when we envisageons of people Estimates , of people regulations or once political .
we not know same not substandard Contents the apply friends usually contained our the of games , our garderies et our schools .
we not we not of lines presence designed to reduce the a of people children to of people Contents the headed where they just the more clear of their time .
he there ago $ other duties that could responsibilities a office of the of the environment asset people children .
second , we should support endorsed motion asset do favour hallmark that our country respect people commitments that he ago retired favour towards health statement of 1998 that people leaders of the G - 8 resulted eye Act la health of people children et the environment et favour countries health Convention of 1991 Current to people rights of the child .
asset meet these commitments , he tangibly a exercise political , a exercise as 22 whose we we been witnesses to people States - States . singing little closely to the same payment where our leaders promettaient to strip constituents all kind of measures asset people children , the chairman Clinton ago Second to all people agencies MLAs of determine of manner made people risks asset health security et health the related so of wheel of people repercussions recent Act people children et of modify people political , people programs , people activities et people standards favour untold asset involved what imbalance .
little after , laU.S. ' the Agency ago movement his office of the of the environment asset people children order of apply act to health asking of the chairman , et the body ago announced health implementation favour hearts of a program favour 1995 - a program National designed to protect health health of people children against people risks help .
lights not knows not plainly damned share of people changes he tangibly included to the office et to people programs implemented favour hearts by the EPA .
what that the lights knows however , what is that laU.S. the Quality the giving require now health reassessment of people levels of tolerance regarding closely of 10 40,000 pesticides , that health new standard atmosphérique related to the ozone should apply premiums each year by a created of case of to pulmonaires of less home people children et that the EPA asking to his staff of take favour consideration people new - Government , people children et people women people when she makes people standards provisions to the water the .
if , however , we we concentrons Act people more vulnerable of between we , to whether people children favour growth , we close all once wish fortunate of perhaps protection .
i know that the office proposed ago source the enthusiasm of people senators of favour opposite when he favour ago summer issue to the comit .
i hope thing that the interest of certain of between themselves not apply is not démenti et that these senators may to the debate et convaincront strip colleagues of support endorsed motion .

during people six years that he ago fellow to health chamber des people Commons , John Stewart apply is showed the learned the more believe of the system Parliamentary that he me retain been given of got , run distinguant , as he the ago fact whole dapper life during , by his work serious , in essentially asset the more orator well of dapper province of origin et of his country .
composite of coloured dissimilar guardian archi - comble .
someone a ago already said that the influence of a enseignant or of once teacher apply protect asset always .
he or she not knows never where apply will endorsed influence .
Roberta the case of the professor Stewart , which ago health reputation légendaire of own of people people which receiving of people scholarships of la Foundation of , endorsed influence ago solemn been enormous .
the Senator Lynch - Staunton :
they lend may - perhaps fact someone something of well !
the Senator Graham :
fortunately , the professor Stewart is twelve headed to time asset take favour document et orienter the Prime Minister of the Brunswick - Brunswick , Frank McKenna .
the professor Stewart ago also be of people views to the topic of his experience Parliamentary et released two debate bad authority et past by a vast public regarding the process Parliamentary . In a of coloured debate advantage entitled :
Political Mail Moral Thought Reference David Hume , the professor Stewart ago worker dapper concern ability to the regard of the touchstone moral of la political democratic .
he ago downsizing quoted a pleasant of the work idea of what philosopher écossais which is considered as a of people by of people Science political :
from all people men which apply distinguent thanks to strip accomplishments in , health hearts of honour seems revert to people legislators which transmettent a system of laws et of people institutions designed to tell health peace , the you et health freedom to people generations future .
Hume ago the of people generations of parliamentarians favour become , all these representatives of la population look et field which sons including that health reason of perhaps of a good government is of that of people laws et of people institutions allegations Act la justice .
from fact , the Senator John Stewart predicted become to the incorrigible of dapper attest career Parliamentary health quintessence same of the législateur course et conscientious imaginé by David Hume several centuries previously : one législateur which Turcot various what which is fair ; a législateur which saisit the importance of la the contained health creation et health protection of our society free ; a législateur rose to heart the well public ; a législateur which not suggests nothing to the strong ; a man which ago natural a mind crux et once energy , to the service of dapper community , of people students , of dapper province et of his country ; a patriot bringing which ago always including , as the means the became adage , that those which apply document to récolter the consultation of la freedom must favour pay the price .
the deep sense of the service of John Stewart the ago leading to implement once energy incredible contained people committees , that what authorized contained the comit of people fisheries or contained 22 of people Banking or still contained dapper function important et very lack of chairman of the comit of people Affairs Foreign , Ambassador her with jurisdiction et address all people issues complex which the of la Position whose of the Canada Act la deep World .
he there ago one little more of a century , the idea CanadienEdward Blake ago spoke of manner simple of la order of the Parliament to health chamber .
he ago Syd :
transport privileges of the Parliament are people privileges of the peoples .
transport rights of the Parliament are people rights of the peoples .
these words , honourable senators , acclaimed been health Gallery of la life et of the era take of the Senator John Stewart .
transport rights et people privileges of the Parliament taking their source contained people rights of our peoples - contained people privileges , contained health wisdom et contained the humanity of our peoples .
rose strokes the orator privilege of wheel John Stewart asset you et rose been asset him a colleague et a friend during of many years , I am proud of say that once hearts of honour particular et well him talk to what législateur of et kind , what course et principle well of the peoples et bearer enseignant the which ago guide dapper Gallery indélébile et the contained the history .
yes , once hearts of honour particular talk to the Senator John Stewart , which paving get however to the dissimilar of people days et of people years to come to good number of between we which impotent to the service of our wonderful country .
the hon. Lowell Murray :
honourable senators , I not I not extensive of inquiry specific representations of people honourable senators , but I believe that the Senator Graham et finer - even know the Senator Stewart since more long that anyone of another to the Senate .
accordingly everyone case , we we impotent met asset health first once he there ago 40 years .
confirms me gives , me seems he , a number right et once 800 jurisdiction asset speak of him .
accordingly 1959 , authorized few years after wheel disposable my presently of the St. University Xavier , I I run the office of people graduates to Antigonish .
bearer fall - headed , the professeurJohn B . Stewart is income contained health province et the s where he is born after wheel Dr. his station of enseignant - whose ago spoke the Senator Graham - to the University Columbia et dapper function of Ethics to health Rockefeller the order of addressed of people duties of professor of Science political to the St. University Xavier .
each day of class by health thereafter , the professor Stewart et finer we dîné together to health same table , contained health Room to the of people of of the St. FX .
Roberta what which guardian to the era the Jews of people saints , John Stewart et finer convinced two foreign - him , a protestant , et finer , a Progressive - Conservative .
fortunately asset John Stewart , what guardian also the era where the movement oecuménique would the day Subcommittee health leadership of the Pope Jean XXIII .
transport of tendaient health document of la , , of the friendship et of la community to those that they appelaient " our written should " , whose John Stewart Command part .
unfortunately , he ago special a little more of time to people révérends Fathers asset apply take of forget asset people Martin - Tories .
whereupon that he favour authorized , to few opportunities to the Senate these recent years , sometimes to of people times rather tendus of our debates , I I already said that I not known nil another professor of the St. FX or of elsewhere which retain ago to coloured students tree of Alternative et of admiration that John Stewart .
as the Senator Graham the ago said , he is true that I not I not been to proprement speak a learned of John Stewart , but as well of other , I I been his learned here , to bearer place .
singing the opportunity , contained the framework of people debates , he . my performance .
i not I never disposable better that a C of the contained coloured Evaluations .
from whole manner , I not dispel explain by experience why he . of once if upper estimated of la share of coloured students .
i think that lights may perhaps to little closely number that he not could not health popularity favour apply pliant to people requirements of la culture adolescente , as the compound certain beautiful .
singing my notice , he is more likely that he amount their Alternative because that he people , him - even asset their intellect et their judgment et because that he the of people criteria of Achievement high - not of people criteria inatteignables , but of people criteria high - et that he elected learn the better of coloured students .
you find of people men et of people women which , well of people years more later , provincial that the standpoint using of their life of learned ago summer the fact of wheel revival côtoyer John Stewart .
lights me ago said that a number number of between themselves apply are introduced he there ago few weeks to the St. FX asset participate to a , particular et to a tribute to their former professor .
i am number that he ago owed perhaps very a of their presence et of strip evidence of Alternative et of estimated .
Seneca a career which apply is frayé a move favour political .
i query say few words Act people election of 1962 .

John is a speaking of origin so ; he is protestant , Finlay loyalty people States - States everyone favour Chair a Liberal the of Harvard , et a writer distinguished .
i am Madagascar , Quebecer French , Catholic , Conservative as people people of was , wife of people States - States et former own .
i confess say however that , to the incorrigible of people years , we we received of many tasks whose the analysis by program of people Estimates Change , the study of people various aspects of la political foreign of the Canada , et more particularly of dapper political commercial favour reason of the importance ill that ago retired the trade Covenant to the dissimilar of la last domestic .

i thought that what guardian because that he Command Robbie part of the Opposition et that he wanted defend endorsed Position knowing that we défendrions health Position significantly et that , Ambassador last analysis , what bound people Canadians which not .
confirms could also perhaps because that he scene that the ALE not guardian not also good asset we that the Covenant of the automobile , which springs of perhaps denounced by the Organization World of the trade .
whereupon that he favour authorized , what naturally the opportunity of the debates to the Senate , whatever to 22 Act la GST , but lot more civilized that what last , I confess the say .

i believe whether that once small company , called Sunbelt ago meeting a refer favour interest - interests of approximately 10,5 billion of dollars against the government federal asset the cancellation of a contract by the government of la Columbia - Columbia favour standpoint of the Purchase of water favour vrac .
Sunbelt tax his Action Act people provisions of the NAFTA regarding people rights of people investors et the treatment National - what is - to - say people rights most of people investors - et asking of people interest - interests non only asset people natural perdus , but also asset the lack to assist .
obviously , endorsed Action not arranged not heard by a court much , but by a group of expert charged of the settlement of people difference .
account held of once decision Recent of a group of expert of the NAFTA contained once affair cost once society American to the government mexicain et regarding also people rights most of people investors , the government Heritage is - he prepared to apply defend until to the across against endorsed Action of Sunbelt ?
i questions endorsed issue because that , contained health a affair of the MMT , the government ago capitulé Before Ethyl coal et accepted of him plan 20 million of dollars .
health untold not ago never been heard et the government ago concédé that Ethyl coal Partnerships right to endorsed compensation .
sir - you we say if the government is prepared to go until to the across contained endorsed affair , account held of what precedent ?
the hon. J . in Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) :
honourable senators , obviously , the fact that endorsed issue authorized failed to a group special of settlement of people difference seems significant once 800 controversy .
i favour about to the Minister asset whether where favour are people things .
i remind that if the affair is favour decision Before a court or a group special of settlement of people difference , health response risk of perhaps very colleague .
the Senator Spivak :
honourable senators , endorsed affair is Before a group charged of the settlement of people difference favour 1910 of trade Covenant .
he not apply notional not of hearings translated et health procedure not is not opaque .
transport people to the Canada not know nothing of what which apply proceeded .
what is once affair of a orator interest asset the public .
what is why I questions health question here .
the former Minister of the Trade Covenant , Sergio Marchi , took everyone fact asset tribute the process of settlement of people difference more totally .
he is important that people Canadians let if , contained endorsed affair , people rights of people investors trillion just before those of people Canadians et if the government paving perhaps forced of plan of people interest - interests non only asset people natural perdus , but also asset the lack to assist .
what is once affair extremely important .
the Senator Boudreau :
honourable senators , health question research , what is health Position of the government to the regard of the export of the water favour main from .
i already that the hon. Senator agree fully endorsed Position , to whether that what country not should not rate the water favour main from .

what case particular whose talking the Senator Spivak may perhaps the a of people results of what progress .
however , I know apply he citing course to what stadium - side of discuss favour detail of la strategy of the government et of people measures that he could take relatively to a case particular contained cetera once company American the of huge impotent .
health political of the government regarding health defence against of people refer the by of people corporations

Points to the rule
the hon. ë A . Kinsella ( cc Deputy of the Opposition ) :
honourable senators , I say asset tell once 800 certainty contained our proceedings .
the paragraph 56 ( 3 ) of the rule of the Senate door Act la question of people notice to give et said rejecting :
the notice it here may perhaps tabled by a Senator to the behalf of a another Senator ...
the Senator Hays ago given notice of once motion to the behalf of the Speaker pro tempore .
the paragraph 56 ( 3 ) specific that a Senator may act to the behalf of a another Senator 15 , with la permission of what last .
the paragraph 55 ( 3 ) introduces that when the Speaker wish participate to the debate , he must vigorous the wheelchair et various a another Senator to their health postponement .
the Senator which is also the Speaker may Robbie participate fully to the debate as everyone another Senator .
i think that health same something apply youth to the Speaker pro tempore .
asset deal endorsed affair ask , he avoided special that Milne the Speaker pro tempore happy his wheelchair et that a another Senator the occupies , pursuant to what that introduces the paragraph 56 ( 3 ) et to health logical of people interventions ceremony that she is the contained the section 55 of the rule .
we must meet what that ago point the Speaker yesterday .
i not contesterai not health while of la procedure career , but to the future , he compensated may - perhaps apply act to the rule .
the hon. Dan Hays ( Leader Deputy of the government ) :
honourable senators , I thank the Opposition Deputy of the Opposition of wheel raised health question .
i confess recognize that I not I not asked health permission of propose health motion pursuant to the rule but , to the first , I agreements that he ago reason if I I proposed health motion to the behalf of the Speaker pro tempore .
i I tried of explain health reason asset commentary I I presented health motion , to whether that she Command thereafter to once asking of the Speaker pro tempore , what which not avoided may - perhaps not owed perhaps earlier .

the Canada took one need get of endorsed bill asset ensure the success of dapper involvement to the economy World of the whether , once economy favour full by which , to the say of people expert favour health 1910 , must used contained less of a year .
the I , as the said the Senator Murray , is that the bill of bill C - 6 not is not to health policies .
his wording 8 to grass health mind contained people spirit et includes of very serious flaws .
he not is not number that he incurred protect effective health life privacy of people Canadians everyone favour politics the success of their involvement to the trade the Covenant .
what is headed once uncertainty whose the Canada not ago not people methods apply he account deficit his advantage favour 1910 of competition contained the economy World .
the bill of bill C - 6 is the implementation of a government whose health temporisation the cause today today to develop to whole skating of people material of bill asset protect people Canadians contained the context of the expansion next of the trade the .
the government ago guide traîner people things et must to subsection up coloured two major partners trading , people States - States et the Union European , which apply are already will of people instruments indicate necessary favour 1910 of trade the et of protection of la life privacy .
we know all that lights food that the trade the paving change health manner whose the Canada dictatorship people Affairs .
our country is a Leader Whalers favour 1910 of Technology of the information .
however , people statistics , that people businesses of the country seem hesitate to using what editor for economic that is the trade the .
from after once study seeing by Angus Reid , to the spring last , people businesses Forces resulted been lentes to operating people possibilities of the trade the , well that 12,9 million of Canadians viability the . Assessment inquiry

accordingly what which motivator la part 1 , all people aspects of people provisions of the bill of bill regarding health protection of la life privacy must perhaps . favour depth .
the comit not should not feel that lights the press of looking his study , somewhat regardless health , with commentary the government may hoped that the bill of bill franchisse the reading of the Senate .
health protection of la life privacy is a right basic of all people Canadians et once extent legislative apply thing certainly contained what field .

according finer , these the , despite what that resulted takes people scientific of la RCMP , run eligible of perhaps by asset reduce people risks that they viability used to of other purposes that Right prescrites contained health bill .

science , health bill attendance health police military to obtain a mandate asset the levy of ADN sideshow apply he apply notional of once offence which naturally commise to the Canada .
the fact that health police military authorized now put to obtain a mandate asset once offence the commise to the abroad is once strong improvement , if the lights keeps account of the fact that more de4 40,000 members of the staff military are favour service . missions to the abroad et that of people incidents serious commercial of people military Travellers apply are products favour Somalia et favour Bosnia - Herzégovine .
as contained the case of people provisions current of la Act regarding the raised by people training génétiques , the bill of bill S - 10 introduces that people échantillons thus that people results of people list emigrate perhaps Message to the Commissioner of la Mounted Royal of the Canada asset perhaps tabled contained health per of data .
health new bill introduces also that people provisions which manage Order contained health Act Act la defence national , regarding the Authorized of meet of ADN , health companies et health conservation of people échantillons et people results of analysis it , et people guarantees favour what which ago truck to the Alternative of the right to health life privacy , aged identiques to Right which are possible contained health Act regarding the raised by people training génétiques .
by against , firms resulted been to to the context of the system of justice military .
he is important of remind that health Act regarding the raised by people training génétiques contains once list of offences désignées which mentioned that everyone year Judge asset the once of these offences could do the subject of once taken of training génétiques asset purposes of analysis médico - effective .
endorsed list ago summer the favour two food of offences : to et continue .
Roberta the case of people offences living , people échantillons are this the to the payment of la condemnation , except contained of people case of circumstances special .
lights there wherever consumer people offences with violence people more serious et people offences to character , , offences that people elements of Evidence to character it arresting the better élucider .
lights there wanted consumer people offences become : inceste , exploitation to of people purposes them , murder , and involontaire found , abuse armed or infliction of lésions the , infliction intentionnelle of lésions the , abuse sexual , abuse sexual serious , enlèvement et séquestration .
Roberta the case of people offences high , the levy not is not best .
by against , health crown must convince the Justice that the levy of échantillons is contained the interest of la security Public .
he apply notional of offences less serious where the analysis it not may not always perhaps used asset deal a Crime or favour advise of other .
lights there wanted between another these elements : brings of or , mood of piraterie , due of fact , incidentally by effraction contained a , criminal , a criminal , infliction of la death by neglect thing , due of fact against a force of la peace , launched appointment , decision of , .

what same section introduces also that a report Act the Business of la per of data arranged tabled each year by the Commissioner of la Mounted Royal of the Canada .

these changes stay asset greenhouse of respond to people concerns of people members of the comit favour success to the Parliament people methods of better soul et of function the directors of la per of data génétiques .
finally , health bill is be by the bill of bill S - 10 asset that he authorized plainly set that people the of raised it et people marine the financial favour standpoint of people establish not must serve that to of people purposes of raised meetings of investigations from .
honourable senators , I wish to negative that the bill of bill S - 10 secondary also several changes of renvoi technical asset specifying more certain aspects of the Code criminal favour what which ago truck to the Application of la Act regarding the raised by people training génétiques .
these changes good proposed thereafter to health creation of a group of work federal - provincially which Partnerships asset mandate of implement favour politics health new per of data génétiques .
thereafter to several meetings , people officials provincial of people sectors of la security Public et of la justice resulted takes that health bill Current not guardian not enough clear favour what which ago truck to people circumstances which compound that a Justice not ago not to obtain a levy of ADN .
the bill of bill S - 10 answer to these composition favour the plainly that a levy not ago not to perhaps Wednesday if the court is benefit that the associated it of la human line apply wherever already contained health per of data génétiques .
from more , the bill of bill S - 10 introduces that a Justice of once court Comments arranged authorized to viserne described or once Authorized of levy of ADN which speaks been decision or order contained once another province .

i 6 also Appeal to my experience personal asset people purposes of the study of what bill of bill .
singing title staff , I I strokes to take of people decisions et to do of people recommendations regarding health current of continue people care Carstairs that the of people effects related favour Phase Mr. .
i know of experience how he may perhaps difficult of take what type of decision asset people professionals of la health et people members of la family .
accordingly addition , he is important contained the framework of a becomes debate legislative of determine people convictions personal of composite , what that composite worked contained his Tree InterProvincial .
i believe firmly favour health dignity et favour health value a of la human tragedy .
i estimated that all people effects humans must perhaps that , et what , to all people process of la life , of la conception to health death .
accordingly clear , honourable senators , I me welcome to the care et to the suicide attended because that these methods are with with la dignity tragedy .
by elsewhere , I issue people rights Legal that people patients resulted of agree a treatment et I am everyone to fact favour favour of la Opportunities of people care palliative as average of that people suffering verbal .
health disease , health that et health death compound part part of the experience tragedy .
the offence of every may perhaps the opportunity of once sympathy taken of conscience of break which evidence to of people people of plan freely et consciemment health order of their life , et not simply a process inexorable refers he tangibly apply inclusion passivement .
from another share , people the scientific et technological favour 1910 of care of health resulted amendments current our ability of soigner people diseases , of that people suffering et of continue health life .
these progress not are not without points of people issues éthiques that health society not Partnerships never strokes to apply question .
he is of people case where continue health life by of people methods artificiels is a doctors burden asset health human mourante or health family .
he is necessary of happen to a balance between two obligations : similar of t not give intentionnellement health death to once human et similar of t not heard , displaced maintain once human favour life , to of people proceedings which imposeraient a burden the by report to people benefits to learn of these proceedings .
account held of confirms , I wherever that the bill of bill S - 2 ago to health once certain aspects comments et certain aspects rather .
i supports the intent of the bill of bill , which is of specifying people the negotiations health decision of implement end to health life of once human , Ambassador particular health include or the required of the treatment , the case full , et the brings of Veterinary asset bring health sense .
he is Senate et moral that a soignant the of people Veterinary asset bring health sense to once human whose health life is favour danger , even if these Veterinary wisdom of abréger health life of la human favour issue , to condition that the intent not authorized not of civil health death .
the Senate rose been benefit of the fact that certain the that to fund enough of Veterinary asset bring health sense by turn of perhaps criminellement responsible , what bill of bill is once extent around .
the inclusion contained what bill of bill of once provision possible that Health Canada pointed of people lines presence national relatively to the such et to the required of the traitemen , and people professionals of la health et down their training favour what which motivator the treatment of la sense et people care palliative et consistent of la research Act la fréquence of such or of required of people treatment is once another extent around .
singing subsection that we we established health need of protect people the which want thing that health sense of people patients , we must ensure to what that endorsed extent legislative , if she is agreed , not authorized not once door p.m. to the care direct , légalisée .
what is what that redoute health Coalition national asset health life , which small what bill of bill as a Prime not toward health creation of once asking contained the field of the assistance to the suicide .
honourable senators , distinct the dilemma refers we impotent witness .
how perhaps course that the offence medical soulage solemn health sense , well that he authorized global of abréger health life ?
how whether if a past not ago not been submitted to of people pressure asset that he accept the treatment ?
what treatment become he of use based contained people case where he not the not of danger of death ?
accordingly few words , certainly - we Act the standpoint of companies the integrity of la life , weekly , Ambassador our quality of legislators , we impotent held of protect favour despite of our desire concern of that health sense ?
hence tree of issues which the a review review favour Committee Standing , if the bill of bill had to be the reading of la second reading .
singing my notice , we should give thereafter to endorsed initiative .
health question deserves that we it the own of develop a good text of bill contained the interest of all people Canadians .
well that what text not amend not the Code criminal , I believe understand that he not VI not to favour did people provisions allowing the care et the suicide attended .
however , contained his wording Present , nothing not the that what authorized solemn the case .
health question deserves a Insignia review et once more ample reflection .
he appropriate of specifying that health human to commentary he is fact reference to the section 2 is once human whose the Late is land et inexorable .
he not tangibly not omettre of the specifying , what which not is not the case to subsection .
if the intent of the législateur is of that people suffering of a year disaster of once affection virtuellement mortelle , that what the authorized plainly indicated contained the text .
i I , meetings of the study favour Committee , that authorized contribution once Modified appropriate to bearer section , followed of changes corrélatives .
honourable senators , he tangibly also apply remind that he there ago $ people situations establish a danger of death which not are not spending to once death imminente et inexorable .
he there ago $ many conditions increase et to term term which not cancer not necessarily health life favour danger .
a diabétique which fact a the diabétique fact opposite to once condition délétère , but health death not is never imminente nor inexorable .
from more , once human which is the perhaps favour Phase Mr. , which can of once disease occasions or whose health condition apply worsening not is not because contained once situation délétère , et the bill of bill should the specifying plainly .
asset the deal , I affairs the principle supporting that once human which fact opposite to health threat of once death imminente et inexorable ago right to the tax of coloured suffering et that the doctor or the infirmière which can thus coloured suffering not should not perhaps passible of Director .
however , we not must not open health door to the care direct .
he tangibly apply ensure that he not there retain not once concerned interpretation of the real subject of the bill of bill .
i look the Senate to act of manner diligente contained endorsed affair .
accordingly response to health question that I him I recommendations when she ago opened the debate favour second reading , the Senator Carstairs ago quoted the catéchisme of the church Catholic as following :
even if health death is act as imminente , people care , 10 to once human past not arresting perhaps the of .
the brings of people analgésiques asset R people suffering of the moribond , even to the risk of abréger coloured days , perhaps perhaps morally act to health dignity tragedy if health death not is not deal , nor as end nor as average ...
endorsed Seneca , honourable senators , is useful , but November - we that she is é by health statement significant :
pressure that favour viability people assess et people methods , the care direct challenge to implement end to health life of persons Disabled , patients or the .
she is morally it .
i am sure that favour unissant strip efforts , people senators arresting report once bill which help to maintain health dignity et people rights of a men whose health death is imminente et inexorable thus that people standards meet of a event of la health .
honourable senators , what bill of bill we gives also the opportunity of strengthen the support to people programs of care palliative to the Canada .
from good care palliative are regarding to R people suffering et to improve health quality of life of people persons which living with once disease avancée or which favour long .
renforçons what need programs to the Canada .

the order of the day Order :
resuming of the debate Act la motion of the hon. Senator Kirby , supported by the hon. Senator Lewis , Refer to health second reading of the bill of bill C - 6 , Act designed to facilitate et to promote the trade the favour we people information gain tax , used or information contained some circumstances , Ambassador providing the use of methods on asset information or they of the information et of people financial et favour amend health Act Act la Evidence to the Canada , health Act Act people material regulatory et health Act Act la review of people laws .
the hon. Wilbert J . Keon :
honourable senators , I like benefit of the opportunity asset do few the observations Act the bill of bill C - 6 .
what is a bill of bill extremely necessary that I supports with enthusiasm , everything favour rose few reservations .
i . therefore the need of do few the observations Act the bill of bill before that he authorized out to a Committee .
since few years , health ability of the Canada ' Camera , of deficit , of fusionner , of ports et of using of people satisfy apply is reduced in .
he favour result that of people satisfy favour everyone type circulent contained the country , et same everywhere elsewhere Act la planet , with more of freedom et of , that never previously .
surely , the National of our ability to bearer regard includes of people benefits , but he not favour remains not less that health question of la cueillette , of la information et of the use of people information C a number number of concerns provisions to their character private et " .
honourable senators , to the clearly , the bill of bill C - 6 ago slight subject of protect people information gain tax by the sector private et , Ambassador fact , of we allow of up people progress of la Technology .
since 1982 , health Act Act la protection of la life privacy court people information gain claimants by the government federal .
transport provinces apply are pourvues of material similar .
however , he not favour paving not of same asset people information claimants by the sector private .
singing bearer regard , what bill of bill apply is otherwise fact wait .
we not must not act too move , without wheel examined to investigate all people repercussions of endorsed initiative .
he not is not a field where the character private et " of people information claimants not is also important that 22 of la health .
health example et people concerns of la population favour 1910 of Donor et of treatment of people information Act la health are well actresses , but firms deserve of perhaps rappelées to the seen of people issues that I wish points to comments of the bill of bill .
Roberta a Prime time , people patients common that people information Carstairs people regarding known confidentiels .
then , they serious important of whether damned use their arranged for et to which these months manage information , et they not want mostly not that these information viability have to of people 33 without that they not favour viability process et without that they not equipped given their agreed .
finally , people patients palatable hesitate to cases of people satisfy people regarding to people professionals of la health apply they apply interrogent Act the use or health information desdites satisfy .
singing the paragraph 2 ( 1 ) of the bill of bill , lights established by " intelligence staff " everyone intelligence regarding a year identifiable , to the exclusion of the behalf et of the title of a big of once organization et of people my et executive of telephone of his instead of work .
by therefore , obviously information regarding dapper health or the treatment given to a men identifiable et everyone intelligence regarding people care of health at by a event of la health identifiable are , by definition , a character private .
honourable senators , the Association medical Canadian , the Association to Canadian et of other associations representative people professionals of la health apply are you very the by the impact if that could wheel the bill of bill C - 6 favour what which ago truck to people information gain et to people other activities sensibles linked to the system of health .
as people honourable senators the know , the bill of bill VI to facilitate et to promote the trade the favour we people information gain tax , used or information " contained the framework of activities trade " .
he not ago not been together favour songeant to the system of health .
accordingly greenhouse , I believe that well of people people not resulted not then to the system of health to the payment of develop what bill of bill .
et what is what which fact that , contained once 800 extent - that he is difficult of determine - , the bill of bill could wheel once impact if Act the system of health .
even if the bill of bill is future Act the Business commercial , he is obviously that lights not cannot establish once distinction ceremony between similar - side et the Business related to people care of health that people worked of health like the subject of a treatment ports of people other worked .
the subject , stated favour words waves , of la part 1 of the bill of bill , thereby that his Application to people professionals of la health working contained once company whose health holds function is health Benefit of care of health , acclaimed of whereupon people .
accordingly whereupon the bill of bill influera he Act the treatment of people data done to people purposes of la expected its , of the diagnosed medical et of la research medical , based la Benefit of people care et Act la management of people services of care of health ?
honourable senators I specific .
i believe that he is this of Chief the bill of bill C - 6 asset e to four points substantial .
corporation , the bill of bill C - 6 must another once definition clear of people information facing apply youth the right of the year to health life privacy .
as I the I fact late , he not specific not contained damned extent these provisions apply apply to people information Carstairs .
by example , the d 4 ( 1 ) ago ) states that what bill of bill apply youth to whole organization to the regard of people information gain that she recueille , substantial or report contained the framework of activities trade .
what which engaged once Business commercial not is not plainly person .
he seems that the lights share of the principle that confirms excludes automatically people worked Carstairs .
however , where finit the Business commercial et where start people care of health , confirms not is not clear of the everyone .
accordingly addition , he not there ago no line record provision health foreign of people information Carstairs between the predatory of health et the predatory trading .
second , the bill of bill C - 6 not court not people information Carstairs .
from people rules must perhaps forward favour what which motivator people information Carstairs order of hold account of their nature special .
accordingly particular , the bill of bill must perhaps clarifié et amended order of include , Ambassador what which motivator people information Carstairs , of people rules specific which will the responsibilities Act la protection of the right to health life privacy et which garantiront that people information Carstairs not viability information that Act once basic , et Subcommittee the control et with the consent benefit of the men .
accordingly addition , obviously definition related to health Donor et to the use of people information Carstairs should include of people information identifiables , of people information without link allowing of address the men , of people information anonymes et whole combination of these food of information .
from more , I query do noted that a recent report of the Council Advisory of the information sur la health ago plainly underlined that whole extent legislative rose fourth to the Alternative of la life privacy et to health protection of people information Act la health " should also include of people provisions long allowing the brings trading continue of people information Act la health . "
estimates , non only the bill of bill C - 6 should include of people provisions system asset people information Act la health , but he is also important that these provisions viability tell also to people sectors public et private .
i recommends that these provisions viability ; Act the framework that provides the Code of protection of people information gain Act la health five et passed by the Association medical Canadian .
what criminal could B.C. health basic of la bill gouvernant health Donor , the use et health information of people information Act la health .
participation , health part 2 of the bill of bill C - 6 not specific not to substandard purposes people data on related to people care of health et to people worked Carstairs palatable perhaps weapons .
from more , he not exists currently no wearing , what which suggests health door p.m. to all kind of abuse .
honourable senators , I asking your support order of ensure to what that these concerns viability were before that the bill of bill C - 6 not . his dissimilar .
the government ago the opportunity , engineers the obligation , of give to people Canadians of base rights favour 1910 of Alternative of la life privacy relatively to people information Act la health .
accordingly same time , he is of a interest lost of protect health ability of ports of people data to of people purposes of care of health legitimate et of encourage once wish management et social of our system of care of health .
from what fact , the bill of bill C - 6 is once extent legislative important et necessary .
he is however importance that we veillions to what that she the effective to people concerns concerns by people members of la community of people care of health .
i believe therefore that we should try of assist the government to the comit favour particular of people changes to what bill of bill , what which favour limited once extent legislative still wish .

each once that he ago strokes affair to a regime répressif not rose not the intent of favouring a floor of democracy , the Canada took always taken Position , authorized by of people sanctions or by a boycottage whatever .
since he there ago well little of commitment between the Ouzbékistan et the Canada , I not takers not why we should adopt a becomes treaty to the hour Current .

i know which arranged the .
transport children manage be .

Roberta our planning , we must participate grant health priority to health quality of people care to give to these children .
nowhere share to the Canada the salary floor not is enough high asset allow same to those which resulted a employment to time full of times to health poverty .

transport Fathers resulted once fortunate wonderful of benefit of people congés parentaux .
however , with la bill Current Act the EI - employment , if health mother et the father politics benefit of the medical , composite of people two avoided once period of standing of two weeks .

the Senator Carstairs :

these young which are initiative by Katimavik not are not of people young very commitment regarding to go to the university .
what are of people young which not know not too what that they submariners do .
however , I dispel you say , after people wheel met to the incorrigible of people years , that after once year to the breast of the program Katimavik , what are of people young very commitment which resulted learned our two languages Official , which resulted worked to of people bills of services regarding to the Canada Reorganizationand which resulted now of people bills asset their future .
what is what that he tangibly encourage to the Canada .
honourable senators , contained the speech of the another , the government ago also the his commitment of introduce to new once bill Act people young Offenders .
accordingly fact , health Minister of la Howe took already presented to new the bill of bill Subcommittee health , C - 3 .
i try Examine what bill of bill very carefully asset ensure to what that we not participate not too take .
let - finer of provide a report of the 20 June 1995 of the comit Standing Standing of people Affairs Legal et Constitutional to the topic of the bill of bill C - 37 , amend health Act Act people young Offenders , part 1 :
several witnesses resulted transportation that he needed contrebalancer people concerns legitimate of the public at the regard of la violence home people adolescents with of people information information Act people rate of amendments et Act the functioning of the system of justice asset people young .
the comit believes that nor people young nor the orator public not resulted interest to what that viability véhiculées of people inexactitudes Act la fréquence of people crimes with violence places by of people adolescents of same that Act the economic of people mood .
these which the arresting significant of people fears non allegations et seen health population to hold of people measures of more favour more punitives , somewhat so of do replacement people causes provinces of people crimes with violence places by of people young .
lights established allows say that the rate of la amendments home people young is to health net - what is the refrain paid to people Members parliamentary - , that people young are of more favour more violent et that of people measures more interest apply CWB because that health bill Current Act people young Offenders is too low .
gold , honourable senators , according once Recent publication of the Correctional Correctional of the Canada Convey Act of people data of the Centre Heritage of la the legal , contained the together , the number of young which resulted been studies of once offence thing et which resulted regime Before a court asset adolescents ago reduced between 1992 et 1997 .
when lights small people crimes violent places by of people young to the environment national , lights not of that once lightly increase .
transport transfers of young to people courts asset adult not resulted nor increased nor reduced .
finally , health the of people provisions to the regard of people young ago 38 ; contrary to health example to the breast of la population , people sentences the to people young are far of perhaps clémentes .
according once study that I I the recently , health worth average forced to a ardent rose places a Crime guardian Superior to similar forced to a day asset health same offence .
gold , to the Manitoba , people three higher of people members of their not are not of people young , what are of people adult .
honourable senators , the Canada available of people children favour where to a rate two once higher to 22 aware contained health most of people States of people States - States , which facilities the rate of incarceration the more high of everyone the up activist that favour what which motivator people adult that people young .
accordingly the , he not there ago thought 10 G they of less of 18 years favour where , et what , based once population of five million of Columbians .
singing the Canada , he there ago 4 40,000 young favour detention Act once population of 31 million of Columbians .
believes - lights really that our young are six once et care more , that people young of the ?
accordingly Norway , he not there ago more of where asset children .
honourable senators , of 30 to rate % of people young Offenders are affligés of a type whatever of difficulty of learning .
singing the instead of durcir health extent legislative regarding people young Offenders , we should established of people resources designed to deal people problems of people persons favour difficulty of learning during that firms are young .
transport researching story that people children which benefit of care et of once education of upper quality early their ardent age are , lot less many that people other to perhaps the to of people crimes et to of people mood of violence , that what authorized as victims or as the .
the Council National of prevention of the Crime ago recommended of lead health fight against health amendments favour standing favour Prime instead of good programs Cultural asset people children .
honourable senators , to the beginning of my time , I I earlier that what guardian Saturday the tenth anniversary of the Adopted of la Convention of people UN Voluntary Current to people rights of the child .
health convention forward of people rights of people children et of people young of less of 18 years .
she recognizes also the role important of la family contained the education of people children .
before health convention of 1989 , Ambassador under of the right Covenant , a child guardian considered as a subject refers he needed grant of people care et of la protection .
health convention ago amended endorsed example favour recognition people rights of the child as human , et favour him statement the right to health freedom of Propriety , of association , of meeting , of religion et of la life privacy .
the Canada done the subject of criticism to the environment International since 1989 asset wheel essential of or the section 43 of the Code criminal , which between favour conflict with the section 19 of la Convention of people UN Voluntary .
accordingly 1995 , the comit of people rights of the child of people UN Voluntary ago recommended that people view view to the mothers or elsewhere viability the et ago asked that the Canada and the section 43 to health light of endorsed recommendation .
i am déçue of see that he not is not fact appear of the operating of the section 43 contained the speech of the another .
transport media resulted announced yesterday that health Minister of la Howe required endorsed week of people changes to the Code criminal order of protect more people animals against people mood of violence et people abuse .
transport changes are regarding to recognize favour right that people animals not are not a well et that they obligation favour activist that reassess .
transport children are of people effects to .
they resulted need of our love , of our support et , by - dealt everyone , of our advice .
transport children resulted need of discipline , but he there ago lot of other ways of the a child that of heard to of people view view .
accordingly reality , of people studies resulted showed that people view view . more , et non less , of violence .
the government apply oriente contained health right leadership .
obviously extent which VI to protect our children et to encourage their full best et health getting of their potential is once extent around .
as once right teacher , I try hold a call of notes to what topic .
the hon. Donald H . Oliver :
i I heard speak of people measures that the government claims take asset improve health life of people aboriginal , of people women et of people Canadians disabilities , but I I strokes coast first the more carefully possible , I not I nothing heard to the topic of the fourth group : 22 of people Canadians funds to once majority much .
what is as if we convinced , of la planet , of the less health planet ceremony that the government Present the consider .
i not I however not been learn .
transport minorities visible not resulted never really figuré contained people priorities of the government .
we not advanced not part of what that the Prime Minister Order pompeusement health vision Liberal of the new millennium .
i think that confirms apply let by the fact that , showing to people women , we not attirons not the attention of the simple fact of our orator number .
we not the not non more of feelings of serious as people persons Disabled .
we not impotent not the standpoint of mire of people media as people aboriginal .
singing the instead of confirms , he seems that we impotent simply headed favour activist that Black , act , Vietnamiens , registered of people Indes orientales , Pakistanais , Nigérians , Sénégalais , the , Libanais , Nicaraguayens , Boliviens , et cetera .
we we a group hétérogène of individuals the of all people regions of the world .
we we a group of individuals Incidence compete good number issues asset apply adapt to their new earth of to decreased that of many other are here since a century or more ; we , all to of people minorities which trying of courage people various forms of racism , of limited et of . reflect firms compound opposite contained their The .
he seems that nil of between we not is past of once attention particular or not seems , health lower Gallery of interest or of consideration of la share of the government .
given given endorsed indifference inexplicable et the , he is of my duty of take health speak favour endorsed visit today today .
he ago guide once part small but the of our community non the et without Senators .
i rise therefore health speak , during a short payment , sooner of speak of the case of people minorities visible Before the Senate .
honourable senators , I query remind to the government that people members of people minorities visible are also of people citizens of our wonderful country .
accordingly despite of la difference of la here of their peau , of la form of strip influence , of their responsibilities or of strip free , they compound part part of our vast family Canadian .
he not tangibly not people should nor their however of Stanbury , as lights the ago shortfall fact contained the speech of the another .
according people months own , 32p. % of people Columbians of Toronto are of people members of minorities visible , everything as 31p. % of people Columbians of Vancouver , per % of people Columbians of Calgary , 12 % of people Columbians of Montreal et cent % of people Columbians of Halifax .
singing the dissimilar of people next years , these figures submariners still increasing .
the Canada introduces that he there speaks someone 7 million of members of minorities visible to the Canada favour 2016 .
if becomes is the case , they will 20 % of la population Canadian .
accordingly despite of their number always programs , people members of people minorities visible are widely held to the gap of the flot Main of la society .
honourable senators , at around of you .
transport minorities visible future per % of our population .
future - tracked per % of the Senate or of la chamber des people Commons ?
et that favour is - he contained people forces Armed , the order judicial or the industry bancaire ?
how of chairs of university most - you which viability members of minorities visible ?
how apply fact - he that health this not seems not find of members of minorities visible asset take share to coloured many direct of arguments et to coloured many shows of expert .
how confirms apply fact - he , Ambassador greenhouse ?
the exclusion of members of minorities visible of their fair share of people jobs is a phenomenon which visit all people sectors of our society .
health function Public of the Canada favour is a excellent example .
the Department of la National national account less of 2,500 members of minorities visible Act a total de17 40,000 employees civilians , et the Correctional Correctional of the Canada favour account to worth 300 Incidence coloured 12 40,000 employees .
health situation is still more the to people Department senior .
honourable senators , unless of per % of people outside of la function Public of the Canada are members of minorities visible .
lights me said that , to the material of people persons out by who , he not there ago , contained whole health function Public , nil Subcommittee - Minister member of once majority much .
accordingly fact , the last avoided taken dapper retirement he there ago two decades !
that lights there think .
he there ago useful more of % Subcommittee - ministers contained health function Public , et they are all of family " !
otherwise said , nil of people more of 9 40,000 members of minorities visible that I I mentioned he there ago one deal not refers people qualities , asset become Subcommittee - Minister .
not a odyssey of between themselves not refers the secondary , the experience et the whether - do asset exercise these duties .
what is difficult to grounds !
however , what not is not once issue of time ; what is once issue of attitude .
authorized people leaders of la function Public of the Canada strongly favour the fairness favour 1910 of employment , authorized they not there common not .
well one , Chair given their subject , I not think not that they there common .
honourable senators , health function Public not is not health Gotcha to agree of open coloured closing to people members of minorities visible .
health same situation China contained our milled court .
let once last asset ponder to health last once where we we seen a big of the Senate which Command part of once majority much .
if you intervention as finer , endorsed last could favour become two or three .
the fact is that , according the office of the Clerk , only 1,2p. % of people employees of the Senate are members of minorities visible .
confirms represents a total of six persons Act the employees , contained once institution which is the assist to give the example to of other .
i mentioned these two institutions as examples , but he there favour ago well of other .
the real problem , according finer , what is that favour not upon not , lights B.C. the idea that he not is not necessary of act .
accordingly of other words , lights apply said that if lights not fact nothing , the problem disparaîtra of him - even .
honourable senators , we we already seen , with the referendum to the Quebec et today today , with la fishing Act la Coast is , that once ceremony approach not led that to of people problems .
lights refuses to people minorities visible of people move field favour 1910 of employment .
we should favour speak , obtain the view of people t et find of people ways of courage the problem .
he that confirms not exists not not wearing nothing ; yet , what is exactly what that we advanced .
health same something apply produced contained the field of people Relations with .
transport Canadians . to grounds to wrongly that they living contained a country more the .
he not there ago not of émeutes . here .
transport assassins not abattent not of people leaders of people communaut language .
transport Black not are not the to death or almost by of people their of policiers the term of once road or agressés abuse contained people wards of bain of people positions of police .
everyone the world apply stand et he there ago $ the space asset all .
the odyssey problem with confirms , what is that what not is not true .
the Canada not is not once Arcadie of inclusion proposing modern ; what not is not true non more that all people Canadians . their next .
accordingly fact , very often , the love fact hearts to the that , to health six , to health turn et to health haine , yes , health haine .
from people crimes commitment by health haine are places to the Canada , even if , fortunately , what not is not to health same environment that to people States - States . Quoi that he favour authorized , confirms apply produced .
she ago summer battue et noyée .
why ?
because that she guardian member of once majority much .
we we of people groups sectaires to the Canada also : the Ku Klux Klan , the White knows Canada , the Nationalist Party Reference Canada Reorganizationand the Heritage Front .
transport newspapers et health television not speak virtually not of la question .
why ?
because that health majority of people Canadians not are not t .
asset people the , the fairness favour 1910 of employment , the racism et people crimes commitment by health haine are of people issues intellectuelles rather that practices et confirms apply understand .
accordingly greenhouse , people the are rarely of people achieved .
honourable senators , people minorities visible not levels not a treatment special .
firms not looking not of they which are refusées to of other .
firms want contribute , wheel of people jobs rémunérateurs , Queen strip children contained a environment course , their give health possibility of wheel once life Mulroney et the , as everyone the world .
as people other , firms want perhaps important asset what that firms are et that the lights not moved not account of their country of origin or of la here of their peau .
we we much fact enough of progress these recent decades asset that confirms authorized possible .
perhaps - perhaps am - I still headed too honourable .
honourable senators , I I fact to the beginning of the year a speech Act la situation of la community danger to the Canada .
Roberta condolences bring , I I said that I doutais strong that we arrivions really to the equality of my experience .
after what speech , someone a is ratify me awake why I continuais to defend condolences ideas when , contained my Tree InterProvincial , I not leave not that people things along change .
i I responded that I not sworn not really the choice .
what is once responsibility that I accept questions favour despite of people reservations that I dispel wheel .
honourable senators , that he me authorized Arabian of wheel few reservations .
let - finer of favour douter .
i of that of people . rather the to what day contained health society Canadian et contained people media to the regard of people minorities visible .
the access to certain jobs rest subrepticement the .
transport members of people minorities visible continues of apply do deal of nègres , of chinetoques , of is Pakistanais , et of asiates .
i not am therefore not sure that people things equipped solemn lot changed .
health response not is not contained a bill of bill - what is obviously .
we we health Charter Canadian of people rights et Freedoms , health Act Canadian Act people rights of la human et health Act Act la citizenship Canadian .
yet , people or et the racism the .
transport parliamentary regulation senior et vitalit that people minorities visible should perhaps reléguées to the once - plan , non .
the directors Public federal responsible lot too little of minorities visible , to the passed that lights not cannot of a bill of endorsed government .
from people members of groups sectaires now regularly of people papers and Refer to significant the . racial et ethnic , health violence et well of other feelings é .
honourable senators , health real solution to the problem of the racism et of people or opinion contained the education et people trade .
transport people must learn to apply got .
they must . strip the ; .
asset confirms , he their tangibly of the information .
what is the information which allows of eliminate people , et people . .
she makes of people links between people members of la community et fairness once wish understanding .
however , the information to she Gotcha not may address all people problems .
he must there wheel a commitment .
he tangibly that all viability certainly that people minorities visible resulted right to all people benefits of la citizenship .
what is confirms which is to the heart of the problem .
i believe that he talk favour part to the government federal of promote bearer commitment .
once part of dapper responsibility challenge to we driver , Ambassador activist that country , toward the regard et the Alternative opinion .
what is to the government of tracer health process to follow .
however , he not the fact not .
the Prime Minister et his cabinet resulted decided of t not hold account of la question of people minorities visible .
they compound as if she not account not .
his Hon. the Speaker Acting :
honourable senators , I regret of duty interrupt the hon. Senator , but his time of speak is you .
reportedly - he health permission of continue ?
from people Senators :
from agreed .
the Senator Oliver :
thank , honourable senators .
strip problems not deserve not our attention .
find of people solutions asset eliminate the racism , people inégalités et health discrimination , what not is not once priority national .
from whole clearly , I not dispel perhaps of agreed with endorsed attitude , et what is endorsed Opposition which me because to intervene to the Senate today today .
accordingly ending , honourable senators , I right that if the government not means not apply address to endorsed issue , we could the do here .
seen health diversity of people knowledge et health rich experience of people senators , I am sure that a debate Act la hearts of people minorities visible to the Canada study instead to of useful evidence .
if we to then pursue the study of la question , a Subcommittee - Committee of the comit of people Affairs payroll could perhaps set to bearer greenhouse .
his mandate could another once region of the country during commentary he recueillerait et compilerait people hand people more to day Act the employment to the breast of people minorities visible .
lights could also own a Committee Joint of la chamber des people Commons et of the Senate asset ensure a follow to people findings of the comit Daudlin of 1984 .
you you recall that what Committee Partnerships examined health involvement of people minorities visible to health life of la society Canadian .
damned that authorized health road empruntée , honourable senators , we not must not follow the example of the government favour principles , .
the hon. Mira Spivak :
honourable senators , I wish to congratulate people senators which resulted presented et supported health motion of Adopted of the Adresse favour response to the speech of the another because they resulted all two spoke with eloquence to the behalf of strip provinces et regions .
the funding of la research et health test far asset ensure what funding arresting wheel a effect Act la vitality same of a country et determine the future of his economy et of his system of health , thereby that the well - perhaps of coloured citizens .
well that I want would of the speech of the another , I wish to 209 few once of coloured flaws .
what is what that the price Prime John Polanyi why health " marketing of la it " .
meetings of once Recent time Before health Corporation Royal , he ago fellow endorsed trend favour act that she is people universities Forces et s people more brilliant scientific of the country to apply - .
he avoided revival add that endorsed trend percentage also to the collapse of la function Public which naturally , to a payment given , more centrée Act the better interest of people consumers et of la population that Act people concerns of people corporations .
the set of the price Prime apply favour is taken to health political of funding of la research of people governments federal et provincial , which resulted fact of people universities of people cent of the industry .
the Canada is informed too far , took he said , Ambassador the health research industrialisée to people for of la research systémique or research .
the paid to people States - States of scientific et of researchers of Prime plan is also the outcome , of the less favour part , of endorsed political little be because , enough to , people States - States apply are held to felt of endorsed industrialisation of la research .
singing people States - States , only per % of la research career are . by the sector private .
i hope that the initiative great contained the speech of the another to the regard of people Instituts of research favour health be a change of people values Act what standpoint .
transport farmers resulted are endorsed year of people grow records or almost .
accordingly Saskatchewan only , they resulted produced 27,8 million of tonnes of around , of oléagineux et of crops special .
et yet , their 1,000 - hundreds et their start of life are leading favour part wishes totally because that people grants federal resulted been down to once the of what that people governments approach et validate market to strip own producers céréaliers .
the Canada not subventionne not these producers agricultural .
if the silence of the speech of the another guardian cruel , health response of the government to health crisis contained people weeks which resulted follow évoquait the " silence of people agneaux " .
transport premiers ministers of the Manitoba et of la Saskatchewan , which are came to Ottawa , acclaimed been sommairement either .
the Minister federal of the concerned ago announced that a amount Supplementary of 170 million of dollars citing said to the Program of assistance favour case of catastrophe related to the income Farm , which types ACRA .
what figure represents less of per % of what that people premiers ministers of the Manitoba et of la Saskatchewan post necessary .
what spring , the government a ago specific 79 million of dollars asset come favour assistance to people farmers victims of floods .
he said now that he not is not favour extent of plan dapper quote - share .
health Saskatchewan wherever also the arrangement impraticable et looking to apply discussed of the program ACRA .
even if people provinces achieved contributing still more , the problem , what is that to the clearly , the program ACRA is far of perhaps to health policies .
accordingly date of the 25 October , the program not Partnerships déboursé that 227 million of dollars , authorized less of per % of what that the Minister respect of extent of assistance of 1,78 1.1 of dollars .
as he ago summer already earlier contained endorsed visit , more of la half of people coastal appointments by people Columbians of the Manitoba et of la Saskatchewan resulted been why .
Seneca what that Morris Dorasch said to what comments contained Agri - A :
when he come , the program ACRA offers a funding to people news persons , displaced people news reasons et of la concerned manner .
i query same a standpoint which ago summer raised to the dissimilar of the debate of emergency .
transport farmers must obtain of the money before ë .
apply they not favour receiving not , they not manage not favour extent of ensemencer to the spring .
what is also simple that confirms .
lights may their offer of the assistance of all kind of ways , that what authorized by the account of the income costs , people drop or health reduction legislative of people rates of transportation that people farmers must pay et which should , of after of people studies , perhaps down of to the less 5 Expenditures health between .
the Minister of people Finance we ago confirmed that the money not lack not .
the problem apply wherever therefore to the level of la strongly political .
what is why people agencies of the Western trying of small the Prime Minister of come see by him - even people consequences of endorsed crisis favour anyone visit to people sectors agricultural of the Western .
he ago right to health same protection of la share of the government of the Canada that people other producers receiving contained of other country with compete he is favour competition .
today today , our producers of Wheat receiving less of the 33 of people grants whose considered strip competitors favour Europe .
the Leader of the government to the Senate ago book to people provinces of agree of contributing more to the program ACRA .
i confess do noted that to people States - States also well that favour Europe , what is the level the more high of government which recent people grants .
nil state validate not offers of programs of grants agricultural which vaillent health worth of perhaps mentioned .
the superbudget of the Union European is 22 which apply youth to people grants agricultural .
from people thousands of farmers et strip families are milk of vigorous health earth , et lights us said that what is health consequential inexorable of the progress technologique , but the industrialisation contained what sector not is not inexorable et not engaged not a progress .
the time is may - perhaps ratify asset people farmers of express their milled message durum .
purchase of people intrants which compound increasing health production et people revenues of the Canada favour $ Foreign thanks to people exports , but non the income costs of people farmers , what is once concerned affair which not receive no value to people initiatives et to the the of people farmers .
the problem of la family Farm is give contained a section that I I received recently of my intrépide Leader .
i like favour read a pleasant :
until to everyone recently , health most of people people contained the world were nourris by people smaller farmers which , various foods of basic asset could people communaut local et people markets premises .
but with people rules of the major , people smaller farmers set .
Roberta once vast part of the world ( including including to people States - States ) , of people corporations international resulted taken favour document of other elements of the agriculture et materials lot of products chemical et now health biotechnologie .
transport small , resulted yielding health hearts to of there rivers of monocultures of the francophone to the export .
et everyone what transportation of use food détériore the environment .
everyone what transportation of foods by pipeline , by clause or by flying to people four university of la planet fact increasing health consumption of energy , worsening health pollution of people fisheries et of the whatever et percentage to people changes , ... ... tienne .
he tangibly more of emballages , what which hormone once more vast exploitation of people Forestry .
he tangibly of new available .
et , of whole manner , people foods products industriellement are less which , coupled of people products chemical which polluent the soil et the water et questions of people problems of health Public .
by therefore , not not protect the exploitation Farm , what is country once resources believe .
from elsewhere , the exploitation Farm not is more small .
singing the Canada , she may do of 10 40,000 to 20 40,000 hectares .
the Senator Carstairs ago spoke with lot of eloquence of the Program of Action National asset people children et of the importance of the education contained health small boyhood .
i him right simply that , if she means propose once new once once Modified to the Code criminal Act people view view , I difficult pleased of support once ceremony Modified .
when I I to the council school , to the Manitoba , we we itself these view contained the settlement .
let - finer of say a word to the topic of other elements of the program which not apply concrétiseront may - perhaps not quickly .
thus , Ambassador June 1997 et during health campaign election , he ago summer said that a new government Liberal établirait of people centers of Achievement asset ensure the well - perhaps of people children et débloquerait a funding of 20 million of dollars Act five years .
once some of months more later , nil centre not ago still been implemented Act foot .
health question of people garderies is still more important .
i like speak of two reports recent asset we remind why we not must not should people services of custody et why we we need of a system National .
the Prime , et the Senator Carstairs there ago fact reference , what are people new evidence neuroscientifiques which a that people three creation years of life of the child resulted of people repercussions Act dapper ability of learning , his behaviour et dapper health during whole dapper life .
no not give to the child a good departure contained health life , what is what which written the real deficit of 1910 grise to the Canada , not the paid of people funding .
second , the report fact raises that people investment Public contained people programs apply the to people very young children are also substantial that people investment contained the education . , high et Superior et contained health health .
estimates , the report makes that people communities this very effective to integrate people programs provincial et MLAs to the level structure .
what rapport , as lot of other before him , remind to people leaders political that , run they négligent people services of custody , they the compound to people risks of la society .
he asking to the government federal of investir3,5 billion of dollars contained a system National of garderies of quality et achieve favour partnership with people parents et people governments provincial et territorial .
that the a becomes investment ?
according the report :
from many programs Cultural regulation people families , but people services of custody constitute the armature of all these programs .
transport services of custody are the program which recoupe to health once health security of the income et people services .
lights ago difference to ground occasions that people services of custody are the discussed importance of la involvement of people parents , mostly of people mothers , to health population huge .
the improvement of la involvement of people mothers to health population huge is cooperation if the lights means reduce health poverty will .
Michael McCracken , of Infometrica , is informed still more far et ago number the number of jobs base perhaps jobs .
once reduction of a 1.1 of dollars of people taxes Act the income of people duty service approximativement 9 40,000 jobs to the cost of 96 40,000 Expenditures by employment .
a 1.1 of dollars 3.26 to people services of custody service 46 40,000 jobs to a cost of 8 higher Expenditures by employment .
what is of elsewhere a The enough better because that he shows that people workers of garderies not less not enough paid .
however , what are headed of people facts bruts .
health journalist Linda McQuaig we said that Health Canada took strategy a bill of program National of garderies .
however , he seems that the government of the Canada not is not what program with lot of effect et that he not favour fact not health Opportunities .
from more , he not is not fact appear contained the speech of the another of la protection of la health of people children against people threats related .
let - finer of you give a example .
we know that people incinérateurs becoming , some industries et people people which compound brûler of the wood treaty émettent of people dioxines contained the environment .
we know that of people footsteps of endorsed safe countries very the apply friends contained our foods .
if still , lights favour wherever contained the milk maternel to of people levels 40 once senior to health concentration contained a steak .
once opportunity favour gold apply is introduced , obviously , to the dissimilar of the debate Act the bill of bill C - 32 , displaced ensure to what that people dioxines viability for bannies et convince people municipalities , people governments provincial et people businesses of modify strip process the .
the government ago also witnesses the opportunity of do Evidence of exercise favour négociant a treaty Covenant of ban of people dioxines order that people Canadians viability protection against the transportation atmosphérique Act of openness the of people dioxines et of other products chemical said .
however , he not is not too later - lights may always act .
Roberta the speech of the another , he is said that of people measures manage taken Act people pesticides .
these measures apply compound wait since long , because he exists now someone 6 40,000 products the which are back to the Canada .
gold , as the Auditor General the ago underlined , no hour not is recueillie Act the use of people pesticides et we not know not non more pressure are all strip ingrédients , because recommendation people ingrédients active must perhaps officially back , Robbie that people huiles or solvants directly used as other military draw much .
transport effects of people pesticides Act people children not are not mesurés .
banking people effects Act people adult the are .
his Hon. the Speaker Acting :
i regret of interrupt the Senator , but his time of speak is you .
the Senator Spivak :
Weizmann - I finishing condolences observations , honourable senators ?
his Hon. the Speaker Acting :
is - what of agreed , honourable senators ?
from people Senators :
from agreed .
the Senator Spivak :
he not apply notional headed that of few - few of people flaws of la Act Act people products antiparasitaires of 1969 , which is West dépassée .
he there ago five years , the government ago realized public the " book mauve " , contained cetera he ago proposed a new system regulatory , Pope the conflict of interests inherent of concerned Canada , which notional to health once as move et as body of regulatory of people products antiparasitaires .
the power of regulatory ago summer transféré to the Minister of la Health .
five years more later , no bill not ago still been introduced .
as the say AT . S . Eliot , perhaps - lights apply wait to what that nothing not up apply . between health thinking et the Action ?
fact that , if the government ago recognized the conflict of interest which account to the level of people pesticides , he refuses of see the conflict of interest which exists to the level of people issues of la security food et of the environment .
the Agency Canadian of inspection of people foods , by example , promotrice of la biotechnologie , run is the favour situation of conflict when she apply is seen making , by the bill of bill C - 32 , health responsibility of the assessment of the effect Act the environment of la companies upon of people plantes et of people animals .
what guardian the the role of continues Canada .
the another issue whose I like speak few , what is similar of the change take .
the speech of the another said that the government the with people other orders of government asset meet the commitment taken by our country to Kyoto .
asset those which lend need that lights the their remind , the commitment taken to Kyoto guardian once manner asset people country , there including the Canada , which not sons not therefore people commitments taken to Rio of blood health opposite .
hence closely of once domestic that people country resulted early of reduce people emissions of gas to greenhouse of greenhouse et the Canada , between other country , not ago still established nil plan .
what that I wish say is very simple .
the cost of people damage compensation by people natural Natural contained the world double all people five to ten years .
accordingly Nova , they apply chiffraient to less of 10 billion of dollars by year .
singing subsection , they apply chiffrent to more of positions billion .
the year last , people companies of just to the Canada resulted owed pay million 1.1 of dollars .
the hon. Normand Grimard :
i I extensive my career of lawyer favour of .
i me am same mesuré , meetings of once elected federal , et confirms asset my more orator and , to é , the son of Réal , as lights the why all headed - devastating .
today today , he rest 38 days before of open the champagne that lot dégusteront the 31 December asset fêter , to midnight , the pleasant contained a another century et a another millennium .
yet , people soon trade of people States - States to big price , which garniront the plateau , party to several that they not arresting more understanding tree that before to the outside of the country .
accordingly greenhouse , the expenditures Heritage ago descended of the 33 of dapper value since people years positions , whose once right part during people three recent years .
transport employees families are tax favour dollars Travellers .
strip as , which into more to people States - States , voyagent .
during that people property - the education , people smaller are to the regime because their salary worth 1950 Subcommittee asset each expenditures able by people Americans , et they must pay the Expenditures asset each of strip , favour organization of people States - States .
i know that the lights paving me tell : " Tu just of the of .
this well , non ! Ban a side , he not is not issue of saturer the market artificiellement of $ .
but of the another , I note that the speech of the another not secondary nothing to those which apply met of la health of our expenditures .
the government not seems situation apply énerver .
the year last , the Prime Minister apply the to contempt that what not is not serious if people tourists Travellers not arresting apply tribute to people States - States , since they wonderful to the Brunswick - Brunswick .
i am well favour favour of people Canadians tourists home themselves of thanking .
i issue that once economy well the making by break - even , but I wish to say that I not like not non more the Canadian of résignation which challenge to say that if people Canadians arresting go to the Brunswick - Brunswick or , to what account - headed , everywhere elsewhere to the Canada , they not resulted not to apply . .
damned inspiration et breaching set wherever lights Rural the speech of the another ? Position response is simple : $ people . et of people miettes .
asset favour create , he compensated reduce people taxes .
gold , each once that the lights concrete the Prime Minister et coloured ministers to what comments , they friends always of people reasons asset Teleglobe the payment of act .
singing the contrary , the Canada tolère a rate of unemployment high by report to 22 of our mate of the south , a burden tax accablant , once disette of s et once absence of jobs asset people young .
comble of everyone , our funding people more the émigrent to people States - States asset two reasons : $ people best and , because that tax favour money validate , et less of taxes to pay .
he there ago also of many funding foreign which sign of contribute to the Canada asset people same reasons .
Peter C . and , a orator writer et observer of , took written during of people decades Act the economy Canadian .
Roberta a section released contained health social Affairs of the Ottawa Citizen du17 November 99 , Mr. of ago said that the chairman of - Networks , John Roth , Partnerships reason when he ago Syd recently that the rate of Proposed Act the income of people duty favour effect to the Canada . the paid to people States - States of people university people more competent et brilliant of our country .
booted . and ago said that , contained the last executive of the Ivey won Journal of la the Reference Independent Ontario , John Roth ago comparé endorsed loss to similar of Gretzky of la upper Technology .
who more is , the Roth , only 28 of people 400 outside senior of - on to the Canada .
honourable senators , you prostituted certainly received yesterday , everything as finer , a release of the Cercle National of people journalists , displaced we position that 22 whose I just of you speak , John Roth , Chairman et Opposition of la leadership of - Networks , immunities once conference Wednesday , the 1 December 99 , to Ottawa .
the defence of dapper conference is the following : " Pourquoi the Canada loses he non only coloured more centres talents et coloured positions people better which , but also coloured leaders of leadership of the industry ? "
therefore , based a number plan , the government répand once half - truth .
we vendons now % of our exports to people States - States et a expenditures low we advantage to what level .
but the revers of la bobsled , what is that the government escamote et refuses of cases that we achetons also per % of our , of people States - States et that we must pay almost the Expenditures Heritage asset each expenditures validate .
these , the of the expenditures engloutissent of people amounts extremely substantial of our wheel .
from people States - States , to the dissimilar of people six premiers months of 99 , we we the asset 25,8 billion of dollars favour extra under , papers of alternative et equipment wheelchair , thereby that asset closely of 22 billion of dollars favour bouilloires et machinerie the asset health vast industry .
once another expected cooperation of our , is the equipment regarding et people aircraft of registration asset compete we we versé11,7 billion of dollars to people States - States favour six months .
according once another study , the price of people GST trillion wheat to the Canada took 38 of while % to the dissimilar of la last year .
from more , when we vendons to people States - States our Contents creation , whose our Railway et our aluminium favour vrac , we people rachetons very often and contained people products on , Ambassador versant once double cent if our expenditures is low .
Roberta our custody - and , the price of people soon et of people légumes , Ambassador majority of Tax American , took 38 of per % since 1992 , Robbie that 22 of people around ago 38 of almost per % .
we glorifions our voisinage with people States - States asset describe our start of life , similar to the their , et favour same time we we work of people States - States asset we majority , réaffirmant to which means the hear our identity milled .
the trade to the detail , the transportation transportation , people fed , perhaps we - we enough heard speak of people problems of the hockey majeur auCanada - Status research research , people Arts , health television , health culture et the edition we special that we résistons evil to the attrait validate .
the government ago said , until here , that the rate of loses low of the expenditures Heritage favorisait people exports .
endorsed rates of the expenditures created a discussed of people more Standing of off .
he me seems important of negative Subcommittee a another the that people Americans non only the our country , but that they are also favour emerging of the purchase cash , to health room et favour bloc , well that he not authorized not to sell .
they compound document bills Act our businesses because that their price is up devastating favour reason of la his health of our expenditures , the - finer , more low same that " health piastre to Caouette " .
Roberta a section of Position Presse of the 16 October last , lights fact say Mr. Mundell that health loss of the 33 of la value of the expenditures Heritage since 25 years home to once reduction national of salary .
the body what respect once ceremony dévaluation of the .
he move , Ambassador addition , to the Canada ' drop dapper political of fluctuation Monetary et of adopt a rate of loses fixed with the expenditures validate .
Richard Harris , professor of economy to the University the Fraser of la Columbia - Columbia , supports endorsed Canada et apply name contained health strong majority which not there broad that of people benefits .
a becomes blocage not created not the unanimously .
no Chair not what , I not wish nothing established .
however , I know that people hikes et people , of the expenditures provoquent of people enrichissements instantanés .
how of our citizens , which resulted less of flair asset action people humeurs of la météo economic , run the also !
i not dispel not think to people premiers without , of la learned asset people seconds .
these variations subites et prononcées of the huard resulted a bad greenhouse involved .
accordingly greenhouse , confess - I remind that now % of our exports submariners to people States - States , but that per % of our , favour 6,000 also ?
that the lights not fine not that , to that the Canada will , everything paving asset the better contained the better of people mondes .
i questions once another issue .
i think to Imasco which , he there ago to worth few days , took sold Pharmaprix to the Quebec et Shoppers Drug Mart elsewhere to the Canada .
transport 209 of continue Forces set to standpoint of look .
i . that what arranged to the Canada .
status to the plant of montage of under of GM to Boisbriand , Regina transportation Subcommittee respiration artificielle since 10 years et where people employees speak allows of their turn of once closure imminente .
the Canada urge of once prosperity of , but he leading Act la the raide .
what is because that our power of Purchase them ago reduced since few years that we we lost of people jobs , that our young apply met of their future et that we lisons of people messages of concerns contained people media that I hope learn health sonnette of heard .
a not of him more far , I know that certain ways to the Canada ' follow the example of the Union European et of adopt once motto common which citing the expenditures validate .
these , we not favour impotent not headed .
i believe that once whose majority of between we , Canadians of the once or of the another language , we too invested contained our wheel National asset renier our identity .
what is asset endorsed reason that we , of we , , without distinction , Subcommittee the flag validate .
these measures opposed allow to the Canada ' deficit dapper reputation .
honourable senators , I am course that what is the it of all people members of endorsed chamber .
all , we want é to our children a country favour full prosperity .
what arranged only once Action of am et of set which , the performance of our economy .
now that the government seems wheel dominé the inflation et wheel implemented end since two years to health political of people Budgets déficitaires , would a expenditures Heritage to the niveaude 66 cents validate is uncalled .

i brevity the for of the bill of bill , the Senator Kirby , thereby that people senators Murray , Finestone , Oliver et Keon , whose people interventions we resulted lot who to understand the bill of bill .
singing people first , I I , that they appuyaient contained the together the bill of bill , but that they entretenaient however some concerns soulignées favour particular by the notice of motion presented more earlier today today by the Senator Murray .
i about mostly of the process negotiations the study of the bill of bill C - 6 .
accordingly quality of Leader Deputy of the government to the Senate , I confess recognize that I I very look that he authorized Message to the comit .
from people observations me resulted been appointments - et I am sure that what naturally the case asset all people honourable senators - by of people witnesses potential which wish subpoenas Before the comit , whose certain apply met of the wording Present of the bill of bill et sure wheel the opportunity of leadership people improvements that they the see .
as I the I earlier previously , certain of people honourable senators which are , contained the debate Act the bill of bill resulted expressed of people reservations similar .
the objective that I VI favour my quality of Leader Deputy is of ensure to what that the bill of bill authorized Message to the comit order that these witnesses qualified perhaps hour et that we proper mood to the reading significant of the process legislative .
however , I issue health need of do hearts to a debate Act la extent legislative et a notice of motion ago summer presented favour standpoint of scinder the bill of bill .
he there ago same strokes of people observations of the Senator Finestone of our side of la chamber to the topic of the study of a amendment to the bill of bill .

Weizmann , I inviterai the Senator Kinsella to we do share of coloured own hear Act la proposal - incurred health period for to people issues et observations - of manner to what that people senators viability well to the aware of what which apply proceeded et why .
the bill of bill C - 6 favour is the reading of la second reading et he seems that he authorized important asset the Opposition that he favour rest headed until to what that we objective strokes the time of we consider Act some proposals of amendments .
singing my notice , he citing increase asset what do of power rely Act people deliberations of people committees relatively to what bill of bill .
what that I me about to , , what not is not once motion , but rather once idea asset once motion possible .
if people honourable . the idea , I can their ask health permission to .
what is thus that I orders of deal what bill of bill .
however , before that I consistent my suggestion , I query say that the author of la motion et the Main obviate asset the Opposition should obtain health permission of take health speak .
singing title of Leader Deputy of the government , I am prepared to grant endorsed leave asset facilitate people things et find a land of agreement to the Senate .
i should also negative that what not is not health first once that once proposal of what type is tabled since that I occupies what station .
i know that the Senator Frith et the Senator Doody , when they were all people two leadership day of their party respectif , sons sometimes acted thus .
what not is not once situation which should to my notice apply represent often .
he apply notional therefore of once Robertson of do current the bill of bill to the Senate everyone favour the health board necessary asset hear people reservations concerns to his topic .
honourable senators , I I , to the 10 of our arguments , that the bill of bill C - 6 authorized out to the comit Standing Standing of people Affairs payroll , of people Science et of la Technology , with secondary that he favour authorized fact rapportle 2 December 99 favour two the : the Prime Act la part 1 et the second Act people parties 2 to 5 of the bill of bill ; that the debate Act la second reading retain instead by health thereafter et extensive to term ; et that everyone review supplementary of the bill of bill authorized organization favour Committee Whole .
i not wish not propose health motion everyone of thereafter .
we not the generally not of la hallmark to the Senate , but confirms a enough to our manner of do asset that human not retain instead of apply favour people .
however , I chamber to the Senator Kinsella of we give his notice , to the average of once issue or of once well , et I the Robbie of the opportunity asset the send to my around .
from other senators on may - perhaps apply express to what topic , consumer the Senator Kirby et the Senator Murray .
singing health conclusion of endorsed arguments or of what debate , I you Robbie health permission of introduce health motion whose I you I already given people main lines .
the hon. Lowell Murray :

as he the ago very set Syd , he there ago to the Senate a support General asset the principle et the objective of what bill of bill .
however , he there ago $ people problems facing resulted fact reference certain of between we contained their speech meetings of la second reading .
i dispel say very few what that I I to say et I the saying Subcommittee whole contingency of the notice of motion that I I Dr. Before you today today .
he me is perfectly indifférent that we renvoyions the bill of bill or , as the ago proposed the Senator , the subject of the bill of bill to the comit endorsed week .
if the Senator Hays think that proceed of la hallmark speaks asset greenhouse of legislative the review of the bill of bill et , Ambassador particular , the study of certain problems which resulted been Arising , I him secondary my support total .
rejecting said , he there ago one standpoint that I not I not very well including .
the Leader Deputy ago he proposed once date asset the report of the comit ?
the Senator Hays :
the Senator Murray :
what is what that I , wheel heard .
i me let .
the Senator Kirby , the chairman of the comit , me ago guest yesterday to attend to once meeting of the comit of leadership with him et people senators Carstairs et LeBreton .
singing endorsed meeting , we we 9.7 favour magazine health list of people witnesses research , what is - to - say people people which resulted expressed the desire of apply introduce Before the comit asset express strip points of standpoint Act the bill of bill .
as the chairman of the comit could the confirm , health list is attest .
i I said to endorsed meeting that I me intéressais more - if I assure me express thus - to health quality that to health salmon .
i wish ensure to what that people major points of standpoint viability look et i favour depth .
i I found that he not is may - perhaps not necessary of hear all those which sons expressed the desire of apply introduce Before we .
what is however to the Senator Kirby that would health job the of try of favour small certain that they not resulted not need of perhaps hour .
what is always difficult .
i wish do understand that what citing a travestissement of our duty that of try of do complements the study of the subject of the bill of bill by the comit before the 2 December et that confirms exposerait with reason the Senate et the comit to of take criticism .
honourable senators , of other chance may - perhaps intervene to what topic .
i not I participate no objection , Ambassador principle , to opportunity now the comit of the subject of the bill of bill et to do Examine the bill of bill favour Committee Whole once once that the comit speaks fact report to the Senate .
the government means that people things the .
however , run he may perhaps sure of accept a amendment which résoudrait people problems which resulted been Arising here , particularly contained the sector of people care of health , I pleased prepared to what that we the the et to what that we the renvoyions to health chamber des people Commons to time asset that she incurred the And before the ajournementdu 17 December .
honourable senators , reassess are people work of la situation ceremony that I people takers .
the chairman or people other members of the comit resulted health speak .
the hon. Michael Kirby :
honourable senators , I I finer also need of la permission of the Senate asset take health speak , fault of whereupon my intervention certain normally end to the debate to the reading of la described reading , what that I not I not the intent of do .
his Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
health permission is - she granted , honourable senators ?
from people Senators :
from agreed .
the Senator Kirby :
honourable senators , as of habit , without doubt because that the Senator Murray et finer - even we all two been Opposition of practice of a Prime Minister of people Maritimes , I am favour flavour agreed with him Act everyone what that he ago said .
Roberta certain case , people affinités ports are lot more strong that people affinités political .
the fact is that of many witnesses resulted asked to subpoenas Before the comit .
that the lights linguistic the subject of the bill of bill to a Committee Whole or to the comit of people Affairs payroll , Chair heard that my Committee the two reports , me regardless little .
transport two followed we the .
when the Senator Murray said that he means to health question , I believe that he the the Stratton that we must we ensure that we , exactly of whereupon he it favour what which motivator people care of health , et I am of agreed with him .
Roberta health motion that ago timely the Senator Hays , he is obviously that , somewhat regardless if once date clear is arrêtée , the importance is that we entamions our work quickly .
he compensated that the comit seat to rely of afternoon , when , until contained health evening , et that he favour consistent tree Tuesday et Wednesday .
from where my notice of motion .
singing the joint of the Senator Murray , I believe that we must start to Examine health question quickly .
as he the said , if the comit mind happen to health conclusion that a amendment to the bill of bill guardian Haidasz , everything as him , I estimated that he citing important that the Senate whole the bill of bill to health chamber des people Commons to time asset that she the threat before people making of ë .
Roberta the together , I am of agreed with the Senator Murray .
i not I nothing to been Act la safe of the bill of motion of the Senator Hays , to condition that we proper limit health appear of la date et everyone simply can , by written or by once agreement between people senators , that the comit take what bill of bill quickly et of once manner effective .
the hon. ë A . Kinsella ( cc Deputy of the Opposition ) :
i believe that we we using et found a model which recueille the consent of people served et of the Opposition to the Senate .
i believe that we should Refer today today the bill of bill to the comit Standing Standing of people Affairs payroll , of people Science et of la Technology .
lights apply is heard asset that the comit consistent his work et the consistent with can , to that he retain all people possibilities of hear people witnesses that he Justice necessary of evidence .
as health question ago summer raised during the debate , health proposal supporting that the comit consider of introduce a report favour two parties or two reports says not ago not dangerous of importance .
the comit sonderait the view of coloured members et apply the then .
we impotent know of people get parliamentarians that require health involvement of the another place .
i am favour extent of say that the Opposition not opposera nil barrier asset do whether to the another place that a good report ago summer prepared et once good decision taken by the Senate .
asset what which is of la procedure , seen that I I health speak , I pleased happy of propose once motion , to less that a another Senator not because intervene Act la question .
the Senator Hays :
honourable senators , I should may - perhaps leadership that people senators of what side - side are side to modify health motion , sooner of limit health appear of la date of Presented of the report et , of the same encourage , PLAR the referred to the comit Whole .
rose heard people senators Murray et Kinsella , I believe that what not is not necessary asset we .
by therefore , I accept that health motion not 50 not of reassess elements .
if what is what that the Senator Kinsella ago favour head , I not me there welcome not , I am of agreed .
the hon. John Lynch - Staunton ( cc of the Opposition ) :
honourable senators , I asking once in , because I confess regional that I not understand not very well what that lights us asking .
how people witnesses , which are impatients of speak of what bill of bill according the Senator Kirby , submariners - they assist the comit to And the subject of the bill of bill ?
i not takers not what that all these witnesses , which resulted of people will to forward to the regard of lapartie 1 or 2 or of a section whatever , navigation contribute if the subject is out to the comit .
i not understand not what that we me of do .
i not wish not brouiller people cartes , but he me seems that we should proceed favour two process .
then , people witnesses apply présenteraient Before the comit asset speak of the bill of bill him - even .
if we we transformons favour Committee Whole , people witnesses which resulted regime Before the comit learned the subject of the bill of bill submariners - they revert Before the comit Whole asset speak of the bill of bill him - even ?
i query wheel of people may to the topic of the process et of la procedure that lights us asking of follow .
is - what what that the government wish ?
the Senator Hays :
honourable senators , I ask may - perhaps respond .
everyone confirms is enough new asset finer , but I sworn people same concerns that the Senator .
he apply notional here of once issue of procedure .
if the bill of bill must how to the reading of la second reading , Robbie dapper second reading must how next to the Paper .
asset that the bill of bill rest name favour second reading to the Paper , he must how Before the Senate .
health motion is introduced as she the is asset that the comit incurred And all people aspects of the bill of bill , consumer his subject , what is - to - say the investigate of the bill of bill , et asset that the bill of bill rest to the reading of la second reading , what which answer to people concerns concerns by our institution - to - raising to the topic of la sufficient of the bill of bill , endorsed issue not rose not still been courts .
health motion allows of proceed to the review of the bill of bill without do of entorse to health procedure .
we we health majority of what side - side , but you prostituted people keep of the 1997 .
the purpose of everyone confirms , what is of try of wheel once solution favour under of the section 38 rather that of the section 39 .
he seems that everyone paving very well .
i hope well that once motion arranged introduced .
asset people reasons that I I situation , I not think not that the bill of bill nor his study not manage compromise of the fact that the comit arranged before of the subject of the bill of bill rather that of what last favour activist that becomes .
the Senator Murray :
honourable senators , if you the let , I right that the referred of the subject of a bill of bill to a Committee is exactly health same something that what that we recall . of do when the study pre guardian put to the Senate .
obviously , we not could , based the plan of la procedure , Refer a bill of bill to a Committee before of the wheel received of la chamber des people Commons .
nevertheless , once once that the bill of bill guardian tabled to health chamber des people Commons , displaced facilitate his study to the Senate , we communiquions the subject of the bill of bill to the comit minister .
22 - side entendait of people witnesses as apply he Partnerships been before of the bill of bill .
he Command then report to the Senate .
we convinced everyone to fact free , when we convinced before of a bill of bill , of Refer 22 - side to a Committee et of hear of other witnesses .
more often that otherwise , before same that the bill of bill we authorized out by health chamber des people Commons , we recall already disposable satisfaction of la share of the government ownership to people amendments , consumer .
the reading of the study favour Committee not guardian often eye that asset health form , but health basic that we the to the Senate , et which a to the study of the subject of the bill of bill that move the Senator Hays , took long strokes dissimilar to the Senate .
the Senator Lynch - Staunton :
honourable senators , I not I never heard speak of once situation where the Senate ago fact the study pre of a bill of bill which Partnerships already been passed to health chamber des people Commons .
the Senator Murray :
nay , but he there ago one number number of advantage by report to what that the Senator Hays move .
the Senator Lynch - Staunton :
the Senator Hays ago proposed that the comit apply which Act la question , but that the bill of bill rest here .
the Senator Murray :
what is right , et he exists a precedent to bearer regard .
the Senator Lynch - Staunton :
is - what to say that people witnesses which will Before the comit emigrate apply talk of speak of the topic , or able - they , of whole manner , takes favour the a around of the bill of bill ?
the Senator Murray :
nay , they not stay not of do to bearer regard .
the Senator Lynch - Staunton :
honourable - you favour emerging of say that everyone confirms not is that once façade ?
the Senator Murray :
he apply notional of a mechanism of procedure .
the Senator Lynch - Staunton :
i not takers not which fate winner of confirms .
why déploierions - we of people efforts favour two process , Robbie that , Ambassador reality , he not apply the that of a odyssey et same own ?
if I am the odyssey to not not understand , I wish well me , immediately .
i not understand not why the topic of a bill of bill whose the Senate is before is out to a Committee which before of people witnesses speak of the topic , Robbie that , Ambassador reality , what is of the bill of bill whose they want speak .
arresting - they speak of the bill of bill same if 22 - side not ago not been out to the comit ?
i not understand not endorsed part of la procedure .
the Senator Forrestall :
he apply notional of the same bill of bill .
the Senator Lynch - Staunton :
why Robbie not not Refer the bill of bill et favour , once once asset all ?
i not trying not of assist the government .
i wish simply understand health procedure et facilitate people things .
the Senator Hays :
honourable senators , lights ago Points to what mechanism of procedure asset hold account of people reservations of the Senator Murray .
the Senator Lynch - Staunton :
confirms me does , Robbie .
the Senator Hays :
we could Refer health seams of the bill of bill , but he then better the read asset health second once et the Refer as we the advanced of habit .
we we been favour communication with the author of the bill of bill et Main obviate , to whether the Senator Murray , Ambassador opposite .
we favour impotent Energy to health proposal , which is essentially once agreement convention of manner opaque Act the the of the Senate , to the instead of implement people senators Before a fact accomplished , what which avoided without doubt raised lot of other issues to share of similar of the Senator Lynch - Staunton .
the Senator Kinsella :
honourable senators , a brin of creativity is always the the .
the Senator Hays ago 1972 of perhaps the .
however , we we area course of hold our arguments to the Senate asset that everyone the world the exactly what that we serve .
a orator advantage of endorsed manner of do , what is well course that , if people two sides of the Senate resulted once view serious et particular Act la question of whether if what bill of bill contains more of a principle , lights declaration happen to the importance thanks to what that say people witnesses .
we able thus perhaps that by the comit before of we deal Act the principle of the bill of bill .
according once will , Ambassador fact , confirms would to deal the problem if the comit billion of scinder the bill of bill .
if the bill of bill . with of people proposals of amendment , confirms the may - perhaps the problem .
from many possibilities apply carriers to the comit .
what is once manner the of deal health question .
the Senator Hays His may - perhaps introduce now dapper motion .
referred of la seams of the bill of bill to the comit

the hon. ë A . Kinsella ( cc Deputy of the Opposition ) :
honourable senators , I am very the that the auteure of the bill of bill authorized still , today today et not incurred not speak of what bill of bill .
yesterday , I I listened people comments of the Senator Lynch - Staunton regarding the bill of bill S - 3 .
he ago opened his speech by once how very important .
confirms visit the subject favour 1910 of Alternative of people rights of la human of a of people country bodies of what treaty , to whether the Ouzbékistan .
he me seems , honourable senators , that health question serious which should perhaps to the mind of all people honourable senators is of whether if , Ambassador activist that country , we want sent a system et attention the attention of people authorities of the Ouzbékistan Act their subject favour 1910 of Alternative of people rights of la human .
the Senator Lynch - Staunton ago quoted two reports of to and and which parlaient of abuses documentées of people rights of la human et signalaient also that our milled Department of people Foreign Foreign Partnerships favour dapper honourable a number number of papers debates to the subject unacceptable of what country favour 1910 of Alternative of people rights of la human .
honourable senators , notwithstanding our political foreign of commitment be whose we we the opportunity of speak of time to another contained endorsed visit , he is issue contained what case - side of once relationship bilateral .
he me seems that if the commitment be must , whereupon that what authorized , he . lot if we could say to a country that we impotent . , but that we not impotent not loans to sign a treaty with him to untold of his subject InterProvincial favour 1910 of Alternative of people rights of la human .
what is exactly health reason asset commentary we , what country of the Application of the bill of bill S - 3 .
honourable senators , health question of abuses with et want of people rights of la human not is not once something that we should take to health lightly favour activist that society free et democratic .
as people honourable senators the know , health resolution 1503 of people UN Voluntary talking directly of people abuses with et want of people rights of la human et of the obligation of all people members of la community International of take of people measures positive et of contribute their support Kim asset eliminate what type of abuses of people rights of la human .
honourable senators , what is once opportunity favour gold asset the Canada ' procedures a message very clear et hon. .
we can say that we not retardons not health implementation favour implementation of treaties to the regard of several country initiative by what bill of bill , but only favour what which motivator what country favour particular , to untold of coloured abuses . , but et want of people rights of la human .
confirms we tell of say that we not wish not conclude a treaty with what country .
honourable senators , that we would the responsibilities Act people Conventions of Vienne Convey Act la implementation favour implementation of people treaties international or Act certain of people treaties international disability people rights of the man , as the Covenant Covenant relatifaux rights civilians et political or the Covenant Covenant Covenant to people rights economic , Cultural et Cultural , what are all of people treaties that the Canada , to the joint of lot of other country of the world , took popular , respecting et implemented favour implementation et we should bringing attention to people rights of la human confidence contained these treaties .
honourable senators , I thank the Senator Lynch - Staunton ' wheel bringing our attention Act the fact that the government of the Canada move that we concluions a treaty with what country particular favour under of the same right , which ago chaired to health conclusion of other treaties that we we agreements favour 1910 of rights of la human .
i think therefore , honourable senators , that he is get important that endorsed chamber consistent plainly got dapper Position .
we can decide or well of propose a amendment to the reading of la second reading , before of Refer the bill of bill to a Committee , or well , what which citing better H , now that we we raised officially endorsed issue , of Refer the bill of bill to a Committee of manner to what that people senators members of the comit apply emparent of la question that ago proper our colleague , the Senator Lynch - Staunton , et apply months that of people representatives of people Foreign Foreign et of other witnesses come Before the comit .
the honourable Jerahmiel S . Grafstein :
honourable senators , I like question once issue to the hon. Senator .
i not I nor heard nor read the speech of the Senator Lynch - Staunton , but the principle that he they is very interesting .
he we is twelve of wheel of people trade to what topic , not only here , but contained of other local .
he apply the Act a country particular .
the hon. Senator means - he say that , before of adopt once extent bilateral favour 1910 of rate , we should , as the compound of time favour time people States - States , Examine health his of each country part to bearer agreed favour what which motivator people rights of la human ?
the Senator Kinsella :
honourable senators , I thank the Senator Grafstein of dapper issue .
i the contained a Prime time that I not takers not of session to what model of monitoring of people rights of the man .
the experience seeing contained of many country , consumer to people States - States , which the resulted essayée Subcommittee the regime Carter , run is , probante , as lights the avoided left .
i accept to the the principle of the commitment be .
i the asset health right reason that I not know not which apply hiding history endorsed directors Public .
Roberta people protocoles which gouvernent health conduct of our RCMP of trade or of our RCMP to the abroad , I not takers nothing which people cause to leadership by written , contained strip reports the or annual , the number of once where they stay raised health question of people rights of the man , displaced that we proper exercise a follow forth group et obtain the effectiveness real of bearer commitment be .
well that the principle me paraisse acceptable favour theory , I not believe not that he authorized of Application Universal .
Roberta the case which we occupies , he apply notional of once convention taxation specific .
he apply notional of a agreed Japan .
the bill of bill social lot of country to the number engage apply favour wherever unfortunately a which we cause to Examine health question .
accordingly Aboriginal instead , I wish that we participate of once actions compensation favour what which ago truck to these agreements trade .
i examinerais asset my share people abuse of each country favour 1910 of rights of the man et I déciderais favour function of what that I chair lack if I wish or non to give thereafter to the agreed people regarding , or still if I not like not using bearer equally of our political foreign asset attention their attention Act the problem .
the Senator Grafstein :
as must the whether the Senator , people States - States resulted passed a system , that we not we not still fact ours - well that he seems that ceremony authorized the intent of the new Minister of people Foreign Foreign contained dapper new political Act la security tragedy - Use under comes once assessment Annual is Port by country , sometimes by region , of people abuses choquantes of people rights et Freedoms of people individuals .
the the of state people observance regularly et firms compound the subject of debates contained people two Houses of the Congress validate .
we we early not not follow what model .
we we decided attempt of t not do of links .
i not know not breaching side of la bobsled I finirais not adopt to health light of la new political of security of people persons which ago summer a by the Minister responsible of people Foreign regulatory et which ago summer réitérée by the Prime Minister .
however , if we must we commitment contained endorsed seaway , he citing generally comes of hold a debate here order of allow to all people honourable senators of favour come to once conclusion ownership to health seaway to follow , to the instead of we favour take to a country favour particular minister by a bill of bill .
i a asset health first once a encourage of look quick to the bill of bill et I note that he there ago one or two or may - perhaps same three other country - et I 6 well attention to what that I saying favour the priority - to comments engage lights may probably plan health same something , of after of people sections of newspapers , Ambassador continuing of once form fishery of abuses with of people rights of la human .
i brevity the hon. Senator of favour opposite of wheel raised endorsed issue .
before of we implement to adopt of people solutions of material , I rather that he consistent of people observations asset whether if we should participate or non to what debate et see if we not should not Examine systematically Subcommittee bearer the people bills of bill of endorsed nature .
i the Robbie more rassurant of serious according a framework préétabli to the instead of proceed according the inspiration of the payment .
the Senator Kinsella :
once something which me springs to the mind favour response to health question of the hon. Senator , what is that he is necessary of act by to people abuses of people rights of la human sector to health concerned strongly .
when lights apply favour Chalifoux account very plainly , he tangibly act asset total these abuses of people rights of la human by concerned strongly .
Roberta the case of a type systémique , specifically or historic of discrimination , I am fully of agreed with you .
he tangibly wheel once political more i et more general .
confirms motivator all people aspects of la political International , there including the trade Covenant et health dynamic of the interest National .
gold , contained all people case of abuses of people rights of la human , he not is not necessary of wait once improvement of la situation of people rights of la human asset apply to once situation empoisonnée a type systémique or care of solution .
he there ago $ people case where the lights may see plainly what type of calling et apply there address directly .
i not believe not that what treaty authorized importance asset the interest of the country .
he could however perhaps interesting because that he is always good of wheel of people treaties with several country .
however , the Parliament could certainly attention lot of attention apply he off that he account mean a number country .
he is number that of people discussions Official resulted strokes instead before that the bill of bill favour sometimes to endorsed reading et of people issues resulted owed perhaps InterProvincial .
transport officials apply will also Act our discussions et our debate of bearer after - afternoon et they apply be account that people Canadians taking people standards provisions to people rights of la human to the serious .
the hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
honourable senators , I query pursue contained health same honourable that the Senator Kinsella .
i am of agreed with him .
honourable senators , I believe that we should we consider Act la question .
the debate of yesterday 4 well to our arguments of today today because that we talking of once relationship bilateral with a number number of States different .
we we signed of people agreements , of people protocoles et of people Conventions powers with almost all people country to the world .
the Senator Kinsella ago indicated that deal with the state which fact the subject of the debate froisse his sense of the to - sighted , because he apply notional of a state known asset wheel according people rights of la human .
however , I believe that the Senator Kinsella appropriate that of people something of country resulted the same better subject .
i query also me ensure that we , that he not apply notional not simply of sign a agreed .
he apply notional of sign a agreed which introduces the Exchange of satisfy Act of people corporations et of people individuals thus that Act people Affairs of people Canadians with certain of these country foreign .
confirms me turn , because , very frankly , I not 6 not trust to certain of these States asset that these satisfy remain the .
if I 6 of people Affairs with a of these States , as what is the case currently asset health society Talisman to the the , I should accept the risk that some satisfy that my country give to the government soudanais to my topic et to the topic of my company not viability not also the that firms the bound favour under of la bill of other country of the world .
what is a another aspect that we should Examine more carefully .
i I raised endorsed issue yesterday because that , he there ago several months , we we strokes affair to a bill of bill results to the comit Standing Standing of people Affairs Foreign et we we asked people same issues that today today .
i not I not the Appendix that we objective never disposable of answers .
singing my notice , the comit the to Examine what bill of bill is the comit of people Affairs Foreign .
we can same people observations that resulted appointments people senators Lynch - Staunton , Kinsella et Grafstein et continue of ask to people representatives of the Department of respond to people issues that we we InterProvincial health last once that we we examined a bill of bill recently .
the hon. LoisM. Wilson :
honourable senators , I am pleased that the Opposition of the Opposition retain raised endorsed issue .
she apply name contained the new debate Act la Position of the Canada to the regard of people rights of la human .
lights ago mention that the Ouzbékistan , of same that the the et several other country , the a problem .
he seems that lights Terrorism these case of manner the .
i am of notice that lights not may apply once political general which convienne to all people country .
sometimes , of people sanctions are cut ; sometimes , lights mind once political of commitment be .
he may having different on savings to different country .
i think that the Senate ago need of once gallery asset communities these issues .
the comit which receiving contained what case - side is may - perhaps the comit of people Affairs Foreign , et non the comit of people Banking .
he tangibly Examine confirms , authorized here , to the dissimilar of a debate flavour , authorized favour Committee .
i hope that the comit refers what bill of bill arranged out committee seriously health question et favour Kelleher share to the Senate .
the hon. Dan Hays ( Leader Deputy of the government ) :
honourable senators , I not like not prevent of other senators of deal endorsed issue , but people senators served would that what bill of bill authorized out to a Committee .
as he ago summer presented here , he must perhaps submitted to the approval of la chamber des people Commons .
i already that he citing relatively easy of there contribute a amendment , Ambassador what sense that , if we supprimions , by example , the word Ouzbékistan , he not we citing not years .
the Department of people Foreign Foreign leading a role to the regard of these treaties , but he favour paving of same asset the Department of people Finance et asset Revenue Canada , since what are of people Conventions tax .
if people comments held to the dissimilar of the debate are information , et I not I no reason of favour douter , we should we ask why we should negotiate once convention taxation with a country which ago one better subject favour 1910 of rights of la human .
why conclude a treaty with what country ?
transport persons people more qualifiées asset respond to endorsed issue are people officials which resulted before the treaty , which the resulted signed .
ownership to health question which concern the Senator Nino Nino , to whether to breaching Committee endorsed extent should perhaps matter , I I asked of people information Act what which apply fact of habit .
from whole clearly , health extent could perhaps matter to the comit of people Banking or to 22 of people Affairs Foreign .
he apply may that the comit of people Banking , after wheel examined the bill of bill , the whole to the comit of people Affairs Foreign .
from whole manner , of after what that I I heard to the dissimilar of the debate , the study of what bill of bill not apply Kelleher not without that the lights defence people issues that we we other here .
what is to the comit that these issues must apply question .
his Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
your - he to people senators of adopt health motion ?
from people Senators :
from agreed .
( health motion is agreed et the bill of bill is read once second once . )
referred to the comit
his Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
honourable senators , when the - we what bill of bill once third once ?
the hon. Dan Hays ( Leader Deputy of the government ) :
honourable senators , I move that the bill of bill S - 3 authorized out to the comit Standing Standing of people Banking et of the trade .
his Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
your - he to people senators of adopt health motion ?
the hon. John Lynch - Staunton ( cc of the Opposition ) :
honourable senators , I observance that the last treaty tax whose we we been before , the bill of bill S - 16 , took summer out to the comit of people Affairs Foreign .
he as the Vietnam , health Croatia et the Chile .
the comit of people Affairs Foreign ago fact of people recommendations honourable Act , between other things , health protection of people information gain et health ability of people country bodies of implement favour implementation with success people parties of the treaty .
he citing pity of rompre health the that the lights wherever contained the report of what Committee favour the of people bills of bill of nature results to a another Committee .
i urges the Leader Deputy to the health question et to propose that the bill of bill authorized out to the comit of people Affairs Foreign .
the Senator Hays :
honourable senators , displaced what which is of people advantage , to the dissimilar of la the th , both measures legislatures regarding of people Conventions tax , people projetsde bill C - the et S - 2 , acclaimed been review by the comit of people Banking .
Roberta health second sessional of la the th , a treaty tax , the bill of bill C - 37 , took also been examined .
he ago also been out to the comit Standing of people Banking .
certain resulted may - perhaps once wish memory that finer Act what topic , but I confess say , Ambassador whole experience , that lights me ago explained that the bill of bill Partnerships been out to the comit of people Affairs Foreign because that the comit of people Banking guardian surchargé of work .
what is why , according finer , health majority of people bills of bill , except eye of the bill of bill S - 16 , acclaimed been either to the comit of people Banking .
honourable senators , if the comit of people Banking fact well his work , he declaration cerner everyone problem recently to those that people honourable senators resulted Arising , contained the framework of the debate Act the bill of bill S - 3 .
singing the need , lights declaration established that the bill of bill authorized out to the comit of people Affairs Foreign asset there perhaps more actions examined .
i committed still once once Act the fact that he apply notional of a bill of bill had of the Senate .
what not is not a bill of bill that we we received of la chamber .
we we a little more of board to bearer regard .
i think that the fact of Refer before people treaties taxation to the comit of people Banking is useful because that health whether is a aspect important of what bill of bill .
what is the aspect the more important of the bill of bill , but apply he is issue of a country with cetera we not want not do affair to untold of his file favour 1910 of Alternative of people rights of la human , confirms seat a another aspect important .
a country ago summer appointed , et of other the manage to the dissimilar of the debate .
however , health wish manner of proceed favour endorsed 1910 challenge to And of thanking people based tax , assure , to the need , to And health extent to the comit of people Affairs Foreign .
the hon. Consiglio Di Nino :

however , Chair given that the bill of bill forward primarily of people Relations most between two country , the comit of people Affairs Foreign could perhaps 22 which citing the more the to the Examine .
perhaps - perhaps the Leader Deputy of the government arranged he of agreed with la recommendation supporting that the comit active people issues which resulted been raised to the Senate , authorized certainly people issues related to people rights of la human , but also people issues related to health information et health protection of la life privacy contained the case of people trade of information with certain of these States .
singing my notice , we not we not examined these issues to investigate health last once

composite of people committees may do the work et respond to people issues that we we raised .
the hon. ë A . Kinsella ( cc Deputy of the Opposition ) :

our Committee of people Affairs Foreign apply is already a Act what principle .
the comit could very well decide that he tangibly include contained the bill of bill once provision Act the Alternative of people rights of la human .
i believe that what citing once extent welcome et Progressive .
confirms framework everyone to fact with the accept general of our debate favour second reading .
the comit of people Affairs Foreign ago already examined endorsed solution contained the case of a treaty recently .
i am of agreed with the Senator Hays Act what that he ago said to the topic of la part taxation because that health second recommendation report Act la implementation favour hearts of people systems of data tax necessary contained people two country et Act la protection of people information gain .
account held of the debate which ago strokes instead to the Senate , he citing everyone to fact indicated that the bill of bill authorized out to the comit Standing of people Affairs Foreign .

pursuant to the order of referred , the comit must introduce his rapport before the 15 December 99 . care my Ruling , the comit ago held 8 meetings translated meetings changes he ago heard 53 witnesses .
health week last , we we interrompu our hearings translated et we began the study of people the of the report .
we favour impotent now to health third the .
we we well taken experts of avoid that whole publicity authorized eye Act our deliberations .
all people the were marquées " the " et " will " .
meetings of our meeting Act la first the , I I taken well experts of distribute of people each sideshow to people senators behalf , each that I I then done to health end of la meeting .

yesterday night , few hours to worth after health meeting of the comit , I I learned that a journalist of la Presse Canadian Partnerships favour dapper honourable once each of the the executive 2 of our report .
the Soleil of Quebec , contained his edition of what morning , publie a section written by what same journalist of la Presse Canadian contained cetera lights may read , et I quote :
Roberta a report Before perhaps tabled tomorrow to the Senate , people members of la chamber upper , Liberals et Tory , run are hour order of grant to people carriers trillion the Authorized of ensure health Liaison air between various destinations Forces ... ... tienne
et the journalist , acting appear of the comit of people transport et of people Communication , Turcot his section favour turn :
from his side , the Toronto Star ago also released today today a section contained cetera lights may read rejecting :

as I the I already said , our report not is not complete .
we must still discuss of several points .
unfortunately , health and et people reactions that she provoquerait palatable entraver health reflection of et most of people members of the comit .
above - deserved of people interest subis to the comit that I I the honour of their , once ceremony and is institution to the together of people work of people committees of the Senate .

i know how endorsed and ago revival what produce .
i not know not if what is of manner intentionnelle , accidentelle or by neglect .
however , endorsed and ago strokes instead et engaged therefore , to my sense , once maintained to the privilege of the Senate .
i asking that you statuiez favour what sense .
i difficult Robbie favour extent of introduce health motion implies :
that health question authorized matter to the early Standing of people privileges , of the rule et of la procedure asset that he consistent inquiry .
the hon. J . Michael Forrestall :
honourable senators , I supports health motion whose we impotent before .
once might representations of people senators of our side ago product all people reports , we know where apply friends our Minister .
i not VI human favour particular .
the Senator Bacon ago said that he finest apply act of once and by the or by neglect , or of once and us .
what which is important , contained the case subsection , is that the affair authorized matter to the comit , with the degree of priority that she deserves , sooner that he not there retain nil doubt that lights ago physician people , .
that we tirions the affair to the clear or non regardless less that people risks research .
Roberta what rapport , we talking between other of the degree of control of Quebecer by of people interests foreign or by a odyssey actionnaire .
confirms could give instead to of people spéculations which palatable do wrongly non only to the industry air et to people investors , but mostly to health trust that people Canadians resulted institution - to - raising our institution et health manner whose she opère .
the hon. Serge Joyal :
honourable senators , I like me to to people comments of people senators Bacon et Forrestall .
i I the privilege of participate to people work of the comit of people privileges , of the rule et of la procedure .
health question raised by the Senator Bacon is of once 800 manner already matter to our Committee since the hon. Senator Andreychuk ago already raised once issue similiaire he there ago someone time .
he there ago therefore a virus contained the system .
if of types situations apply . to understanding 1999 , what is that he there ago certainly of people persons contained our group , lights not knows not reasons , which not resulted not once idea specific of their responsibility .
i me remind of attention your attention Act la manner whose the Parliament of la Britain - Britain forward of people issues powers .
i like attention your attention Act two decisions of la chamber des people Commons to London which resulted Thompson pendant10 days , without salary , a MP which Partnerships line the report of a Committee before that the comit not retain authorized dapper information .
what MP , I the indicated , took summer Thompson during 10 days without salary .
Roberta a another case , which ago summer released favour October last , both Members resulted fact the subject of sanctions of la share of the comit of la chamber des people Commons British , Auschwitz which ago asked the report et 22 which the ago given .
transport two resulted been implemented to the standing , people two resulted been suspendus asset of people conviction access .
they resulted owed apply have et introduce of people Murray to strip colleagues to health chamber des people Commons British .
endorsed issue is taken extremely to the serious contained our system Parliamentary et contained health tradition which we , .
health reason favour is simple , as the ago explained the Senator Bacon , et I quote people comments of the comit British :
what is to endorsed reading that of people pressure regulatory palatable perhaps certain asset part people findings of the report .
if the lower the account to bearer regard , everything the system of people committees special could perhaps line favour issue .
nil of our committees not could off dapper job et do report to endorsed chamber des once manner floor et responsible if , to the reading important et safety of la drafting of coloured reports , people the of those - side apply has to world , excusez the Propriety , to left et to left the
he is , by therefore , extremely important - et I does my colleague , the Senator DeWare , which fact part of the comit of people privileges , of the Réglement et of la procedure - that these issues , which resulted been raised by the Senator Andreychuk et the Senator Bacon , qualified do the subject of once study of la share of the comit .
we could thus we hear non only Act the Ethics that we we engagerons all to follow but also , unfortunately , based the system of sanctions that we should implement favour hearts asset apply ensure that of people incidents such of endorsed nature not apply . more .
what is therefore contained endorsed C , honourable senators , that I query support people comments of people senators Bacon et Forrestall .
the hon. Dan Hays ( Leader Deputy of the government ) :
honourable senators , I like add few words .
he is such that health question of privilege authorized raised to new to comments of facts almost identiques .
i talking , well course , of la question of privilege raised by the Senator Andreychuk representations of the comit Standing of people privileges , of the rule et of la procedure .
i already that she seems rather of , account held of the precedent where health Ruling , rose to decide if once issue of privilege guardian based , took quoted the regard 877 , to health page 250 of la sixth edition of la the Parliamentary of Beauchesne , which introduces rejecting :
nothing of what which apply is one favour Committee not must perhaps one before that the comit not retain fact report to health chamber .
et still :
obtaining once maintained to the privilege the fact of Issuance people deliberations of a Committee thanks to Camera closed or of people reports of committees before that they not equipped been implemented to health provision of people Members .
accordingly consequential , Your Hon. , confirms seems rather of et I you urges also to necessity endorsed affair as based order that she authorized matter to the comit Standing of people privileges , of the rule et of la procedure .
the hon. Joan Fraser :
honourable senators , I wish support finer also health motion of the Senator Bacon .
what is health and et non health publication which is to common .
the hon. Anne C . Cools :
honourable senators , I like participate very few to the debate .
the subject of what debate must perhaps perfectly clear .
the debate VI to convince health Ruling that he there ago right et well strokes maintained to the privilege et that she must grant here health whole first priority to endorsed issue .
asset support what that Milne the Senator Bacon ago said , I me brevity of his initiative , et I health thank of wheel Finance people facts .
accordingly of other words , the content of people bills of report not must not perhaps one to people media et to the public before the Tabled of the report to the Senate .
needless of the say , what problem seems revert without palliative et same take of the crisis , et he is obviously that he through our attention .
i observance that the Senator Andreychuk ago proper once issue recently the 14 September .
i believe wheel participated to what debate .
from new , the 13 October , the Senator Andreychuk ago proper the same problem , et I him I , extend my support .
health found issue which apply questions to we , honourable senators , is similar of whether apply he there ago présomption of maintained to the privilege .
i supply to Your Hon. that of many senators seem perhaps of bearer notice .

since prepared to defend the right et health truth , against which et marées .
honourable senators , Ambassador a people papers spent to health wonderful career of the Senator Derek Lewis , Q Q . - once life Public set to the service et to the duty - , I I understood how the influence of the baron Baden - Powell the Partnerships International .
Derek ago summer during well of people years a of people pillars of people Boy Scouts of the Canada , rose been during a time the Secretary of the organization national , et he favour is today today a of people vices - chairs serious to life .
the Senator Lewis , all people other honourable senators the know , is once human very modest .
certain palatable same the might of Baden - Powell of Newfoundland - Newfoundland .
health legendary means that , to the era where the Senator Lewis servait contained people boy scouts , the Senator Joan Cook , which is today today dapper the of wheelchair , guardian member of people great of Newfoundland - Newfoundland .
during these openness years of service principle , the Senator Lewis ago 3.26 coloured efforts to health getting of the full potential of people young et to health creation of citizens responsible - of people individuals to people values axées Act the interest of la community et of their country - fault never meaning of standpoint health community International .
health motto of Baden - Powell , " Sois prepared " or " Be Prepared " , which 4 to coloured the et which means " want always prepared mentalement et physiquement to do market duty " ago summer similar of bearer Stephen Senator that I I always been if proud of power might of real friend during all these years .
the Senator ago summer admitted to the Bar of Newfoundland - Newfoundland favour on , both years only before that endorsed Nation , small but ô how important , not thus of apply join to health Confederation Canadian .
endorsed year where we victories the fiftieth anniversary of endorsed union , we let unfortunately to the bye to the a of coloured son et the people more fine , a man which ago implemented everyone the post of a peoples s , résistant et dynamic , the peoples of Newfoundland - Newfoundland , to the service of la life political of what country .
Bouctouche St. St. Maclean et lawyer therefore , the Senator Lewis ago significant his sense of the humour well known et his , to negotiate et to do of people compromise to the Senate of the Canada meetings of dapper appointment favour March 1978 .
when I I met the Senator Lewis asset health first once thanks to health political - once manner based of do knowledge asset number of between we - Derek Partnerships been to Newfoundland - Newfoundland steering or Ethics Main of many campaigns led federal .
the dedication et health something of the Senator Lewis are well facility contained bearer place .
he ago summer member of virtually all people committees which resulted been constitués by the Senate et guardian body asset health manner the that he Partnerships of contribute with people other members asset happen to a consensus Act of people measures legislatures often complex .
health list is attest et the , et he is important of favour do Into .
during three years , between 1984 et 1986 , he ago chaired the comit Standing Standing of people Affairs Legal et Constitutional , whose he is member without required since 1979 .
he ago fact part of the comit Standing of the rule et of la procedure or , as lights the triomphalisme since 1991 , of the comit Standing Standing of people privileges , of the rule et of la procedure , during once period to little closely also attest , authorized a little more of two decades .
the Senator Lewis ago fact benefit of his very orator whether political the comit Standing of la regulatory et of people other material regulatory .
he ago chaired the comit Joint Standing of review of la regulatory during health more vast part of la presented domestic .
he ago often fact part of the comit Joint of people committee of the Parliament et of the comit Joint special of la reform of the Senate , which ago summer set to the beginning of people years 80 .
singing endorsed list already strong attest et remarkable springs apply add health involvement of the Senator Lewis to people work of the comit Joint special Act the Entente BNA of 1987 et to the comit special of the bill of bill C - 110 ( changes Constitutional ) of 1994 to 1996 .
he not there ago therefore not instead of apply . that what the Newfoundland - and to the mind alerte et to the songs spontané retain learning once of people best the which viability Incidence all people persons rose never served to health chamber .
he is enhance asset health generosity with commentary he being his time , his soul et his energy to the service of dapper province et of his country .
accordingly quality of Senator , he ago always including that the Senate of the Canada , as I the indicated without palliative , is the instead of work of the government , a tax to the breast comes he apply is able the Alternative et the admiration of all of people two sides of la chamber .
asset Derek Lewis , which ago fact activist of . contained the movement scout to the country , health seaway of the success apply is always sideshow résumée to do his duty , to pagayer , as the ago already said Baden - Powell , with his heart et dapper head et to perhaps prepared , as the Senator Lewis the ago always been , to defend Mr. the right et health truth , breaching that authorized the context .
right et truth .
duty et honour .
justice et fairness .
these words décrivent of manner strong rules our colleague which we happy .
he receiving of negative also the support of the wife of the Senator Lewis , the the Grace , which is of people May today today contained health gallery of people visitors .
we impotent many contained endorsed visit to wheel very long bénéficié of their friendship with et of their , area .
all our vows people major contained strip new businesses .
the hon. C . William Doody :
honourable senators , I like to my around add condolences good vows to those look by condolences colleagues to the opportunity of the departure to health retirement of our friend Derek Lewis .
i known the Senator Lewis since 20 years et same before , to the era where we convinced John St. Maclean .
what is a man which fate give of the much .
i assure thing plan that , during all these years , he not me ago never been given of hear health lower critic or the lower points to his dealing .
confirms is of tree more remarkable that he ago level the right with success during whole endorsed period .
but the more remarkable still , what is that , ships dapper practice of the right with the success that the lights knows , he ago actively as asset the Party Liberal of the Canada , what that he continues of elsewhere to what day .
i not me recall not of once campaign election , federal or Comments , to commentary the Senator Derek not retain not participated actively .
Roberta health victory or health the , Derek guardian always a Charbonneau , poli , well high , well implemented et méticuleux to the conduct .
accordingly fact , I I already heard say John St. Maclean that the payment the more embarrassant contained health life of Derek , what is when he apply is fact take a day with la cravate the .
little regardless the opportunity , that he 1,000 or that he perde , all coloured activities were always marquées by once great visit of humour a et sardonique which , according finer , guardian particular to Derek Lewis .
singing the Senate , I think that lights apply matter mostly of him asset his work to the comit Standing Standing of people Affairs Legal et Constitutional .
the Senator Graham ago very well have , to fair title , the wide array of activities reflect Derek ago participated contained endorsed visit .
he ago payment a work invaluable to the comit of people Affairs Legal , et dapper vast knowledge of the right thus that his approach everyone to fact practice et i to the regard of people work of the comit et people tasks that lights him the manage difficult to replace .
the attendance of the Senator Lewis contained endorsed visit is , well heard , once something whose we can all perhaps proud et that we should trying of example .
lights not favour talking not to my knowledge contained the book of Claire Hoy , but I not me want not to what that what type of something attention lot the attention of whole manner .
i I sat with Derek to the comit Standing Standing of la Economy Internal , of people Budgets et of the directors during long et , headed still , his work to the comit not arranged not Commerce , mostly by your well .
the work of Derek to Newfoundland - Newfoundland contained dapper profession ago summer International by the same dedication et concern of the detail .
dapper career favour activist that lawyer ago summer Land during long by coloured in .
he ago summer Ethics of the so of la rules Society Reference Newfoundland of 1962 to 1978 .
he is become chairman of la rules the Reference Newfoundland favour 1979 .
honourable senators , Derek Lewis protect the right contained health province of Newfoundland - Newfoundland since on .
what guardian little after the completed of la Confederation whose the Senator Graham ago spoke .
i trying still of determine if Derek guardian favour favour of la Confederation or not .
he refuses of the say .
sometimes , he said that he is a Quebecer to the .

that people deliberations to the order of the day asset health resuming of the debate Act la motion Refer to the Adopted of once Adresse favour response to the speech of the another , sir by His Excellency health Gouverneure general Before people two Houses of the Parliament , run their the eighth day of postponement where the order speaks been chamber ;
et Act la motion of amendment of the hon. Senator Kinsella , seconded by the hon. Senator DeWare , that health motion not authorized not now agreed but that she authorized be favour second the word " eighth " et favour the amended by the word " fourteenth " .
the hon. Dan Hays ( Leader Deputy of the government ) :

otherwise said , people deliberations bound three favour eight days of postponement .
health holds objection of the Senator Kinsella is that endorsed motion should unduly the number of senators consider to intervene Act endorsed motion .
accordingly fact , he is informed until to say that confirms could perhaps dangerous .
i me takers therefore contained the obligation of try of him explain people reasons of endorsed motion .
honourable senators , we we strokes five days of deliberations , with favour average , of people interventions of three senators by postponement , what which fact a total of 15 senators to wheel taken health speak , nine of the Opposition et six months .
well that we not participate not subject by health wearing significant , he is dealing interesting of learn that the paragraph 1950 ( 1 ) of the rule of la chamber des people Commons away rejecting :
transport deliberations Act the awarded of the day Convey resuming of the debate Act la motion of Adresse favour response to the speech of the another et Act all people amendments there proposed not must not the six days of postponement .
honourable senators , what is two days of less that what that I move contained my motion .
well heard , the another place ago $ people rules similar regarding , by example , the debate budget .
how explain endorsed wearing of the another place , et why endorsed motion citing - she once tradition here ?
confirms apply let , to my sense , by the fact that health response to the speech of the another ago always been asset people senators the opportunity of deal virtually not regardless breaching topic , et non not sideshow , as the ago guide hear the Senator Kinselladans his intervention , the plan of Action proposed by legouvernement - well that what authorized desirable .
accordingly of other words , a Senator may ask to take health speak asset deal of t regardless damned issue , without that coloured colleagues not favour equipped been of to the pre , et to commentary they palatable hoped respond .
he exists however to the Senate a average asset do what type of speech et what is the notice of motion or the notice of inquiry .
after a give of once day , necessary contained people two case , the speech is speech .
honourable senators , distinct health manner appropriate of points of people issues favour endorsed chamber .
nothing not we prevent of proceed thus .
the give of once day is tell asset once right reason .
if the speech of the another rest name to the Paper during too long , lights risk of using bearer section of the order of the day to of other purposes that people purposes prescribed .
the Senator Kinsella jobs , Ambassador apply criteria of figures , that the time require to the debate Act the speech of the another not is not total .

honourable senators , let - finer of involved people figures of the Senator Kinsella .
if each Senator may speak pendant15 minute et if we can leaders two hours by day to health arguments , Robbie eight senators palatable each day speak of the Adresse to His Excellency .

lights not may not say that what authorized the .

from more , et confirms intéressera condolences colleagues of the another side , people advantage seem consider favour favour of 8 days et nonde 14 .
the regard 271.1 of Beauchesne questions rejecting :
after that the government ago proposed et supported health motion of Adresse favour response to the speech of the another , health chamber standing of eight days of postponement to the reduced asset complements the debate Act la motion .
honourable senators , what is exactly the same regard earlier contained people rules contained the another place .

i people the sometimes when they huge favour city , to the spring , sell of people choirs of May , health fleur emblématique of la province .
they frappaient sometimes to health door et we their achetions always of people choirs .
what guardian my odyssey representation with people aboriginal contained my province .
transport aboriginal not alone not once part important of la population of la Scotia - Scotia .
by against , their contribution is certainly important .
however , when I I déménagé favour Alberta favour 1965 , I me am fund contained once class of daughters to leSt. is Maclean Girls High name , with of people young women of what that lights duty to the era health Scarcee Reserve , which guardian states to health knew of la city .
what guardian health Gotcha school of studies high where she sons the right of go .
these daughters were always guarding to the gap of all people other daughters of la class .
firms participaient rarely to people discussions of la class et abandonnaient very quickly people studies .
very little of between firms , health 10e year , et I not me recall not that once Gotcha of between firms authorized arrival favour 11e year .
honourable senators , I query power say that health situation ago reduced changed since 1965 , but health truth is that she not ago not lot changed asset people aboriginal of the country .
accordingly greenhouse , when I enseignais to Winnipeg favour 1981 , I me remind of a ardent man contained the dissimilar of s of 10e year which apply is lot et ago said of manner injurieuse what that he quite of people aboriginal .
he me ago commission totally stupéfaite .
i me to for contained health class , Ambassador activist that professor , et écoutais a , of 15 years speak of other humans , of coloured citizens of la province of the Manitoba , Ambassador débitant of people Civil et of people things the that he not finest wheel learned that of la colleagues of coloured parents , of coloured colleagues or of coloured citizens .
after me perhaps grants of the the the et wheel began to do of people observations Act certain of coloured hear , I I understood that he needed do once unity of what dissimilar Act la life of people aboriginal to the Canada Reorganizationand I me am implementation to the draw .
i concerned not perhaps never voice to across of people or of what ardent man .

coloured parents were the , well éduqués .
his father guardian professor of mathématiques ; dapper mother enseignait to health Faculty of term to .
what guardian of people people the .
yet , what , Partnerships once view dangerous will Act our aboriginal that what guardian they .
i thought therefore that I not chair not owed perhaps if of when I I been convoquée to the school of my daughter Catherine when she guardian favour 6e year .
by thereafter of once concerned experience that she Partnerships had favour 5e year , we recall decided of the sent contained once another school .
the contained a new considerable , Cathi not Tisserant not orator - something , what is - to - say until to the day where he there ago strokes once arguments contained dapper class Act people aboriginal .
transport equal resulted fact of people hear rather .
new contained endorsed class , Cathi , to health vast pride of dapper mother , took country Syd that people equal not knew not well of whereupon he guardian issue .
she ago reminded the fact that I route retournée to the Secondary after dapper birth et that I sworn committed once Crie of the north of the Alberta as gouvernante .
what that Cathi elected of people aboriginal , she the Partnerships learned of Theresa .
similar - side him Partnerships you what that he there Partnerships of better contained dapper community .
honourable senators , somewhat after wheel been house to the Assembly legislative of the Manitoba , I am care visit the school of la bunch editor . .
in Lathlin , which guardian Robbie Opposition et is now Minister to the breast of the government of the Manitoba , Partnerships transféré people equal of la sufficient school of Kelsey to editor . asset that they qualified perhaps éduqués contained the school of la contingency .
he along that they not the not contained their school the experience cultural that they eligible living , that endorsed school not finest not respond to strip needs et he wanted that they service home themselves , contained their considerable .
booted . Lathlin me Partnerships the to visit the school .
i confess say that what that I there I seen guardian enough remarkable .
accordingly 1965 , people equal apply ennuyaient , but contained endorsed school aboriginal where lights enseignait people free et health langue aboriginal favour more of the rest of the program school of la province , people equal were pétillants et débordaient of enthusiasm .
what guardian remarkable .
transport equal aboriginal resulted of elsewhere won health majority of people price to the a research of the north of the Manitoba .
what guardian a event remarkable .
honourable senators , I I seen the same phenomenon when I I areas the school to Reference Chairperson Earth to Winnipeg .
what is may - perhaps asset confirms that I am once if ardente far of the self self asset people aboriginal .
i wish to what principle because that I am place that people aboriginal not able never do people progress that they should do activist that they not apply administreront not themselves - executory , et we we health responsibility of do favour hallmark that they parviennent to endorsed self self .
honourable senators , what is a secret of polichinelle to the Senate - et I know that number of between you iii well people Affairs aboriginal - that he there ago - less of aboriginal that of non - native contained people institutions of Secondary post .
surely , of people progress resulted been progress .
he there ago now more of aboriginal which are doctors , lawyers et are .
we we same health fortunate of rely Incidence we , contained endorsed room , not less of five senators aboriginal which senators all once important contribution to our institution .
but what is a .
from other statistics , that people Peoples aboriginal arise the rate of per the more high to the Canada , activist to health birth , what which is victims , that home people young .
these Late are sector to of people accidents , to of people the et - what which is health worse tragedy of all - to of people suicides , people young aboriginal body the rate of suicide the more high home people young to the Canada .
by elsewhere , nil of between you not apply surprendra of learn that , principally people aboriginal , the diabetes is endémique .
a doctor ago same comparé endorsed disease to health small vérole or to health rougeole , that we we Location with we favour activist that immigrant . Act what service et which resulted executive health death of a number rate of victims .
now , they long prematurely to untold of the diabetes instable .
we know that the diabetes may apply function by once diète .
lights not affecte not enough of resources to health fight against the diabetes asset that endorsed disease not year more people aboriginal to the Canada .
nil of between you not apply surprendra non more of whether that people aboriginal resulted still the rate of unemployment the more high .
he not is not unusually that 90 % of people aboriginal use to the work viability to the unemployment .
he not is not unusually contained the north of the Manitoba that people children equipped of people the with la justice because that , frankly , these children very that he worth better living to the centre of detention youth of Winnipeg that contained their milled community aboriginal .
honourable senators , when the Senator Gill ago spoke of coloured objectives et of coloured community , I not I revival me prevent of think that we the all enormous of dapper presence to the Senate .
we favour the all because that he we matter allows , to the joint of people senators Watt , Chalifoux et Adams , people issues rose of people effects Act people aboriginal .
transport aboriginal resulted the right of perhaps treaties as of people citizens to share full of what country .
what is therefore say that he tangibly their grant people same possibilities that to all people other Canadians of benefit of care of health , of once education et of a government of quality .
we think now since a number number of years once response responsibility to the report of la Wheat Royal Act people Peoples aboriginal .
we not we not received of response responsibility .
i take composite of between you of hold of the government to the power that he ' the more quickly possible once response responsibility .
honourable senators , to the dissimilar of people recent weeks , I I follow with interest health visit of people Members contained health province of Columbia - Columbia contained the framework of their study et of their assessment of the treaty nisga' ago .

that envisageons - we asset the Canada : one country of abondance , done of centres espaces , of industries et of resources , of progress technological et of huge the Resources ?
how envisageons - we the Canada by report to the rest of the world , Ambassador endorsed period safety of the history of the world , where people humans resulted the power of contribute health security to the humanity , based la planet of God ?
the arrival of a new century asking of centrer our attention non only Act we - executory contained our country me , but also Act the village light realized possible by people prodiges of la Technology .
when we regardons the world contained his together , we should perhaps learn et it of see people huge suffering tolérées by people systems political of the world .
the 20 century ago summer the more sanglant of the history of the humanity , Robbie that more of 110 million of persons resulted been from during of people means , what which represents three once more that all people Late sector to health War since the everyone Prime century after , - Christ .
during that of people means are organized et the thus of main from of resources , people more those of our world wrong their situation apply the still more .
sixty country apply the regularly since 1980 .
transport services of housing , of health et of education compound the alone contained the world images .

even if we , to the Canada , impotent , he favour function of people standards international , what not is not once reason asset perhaps evidence or with of we .
singing the dissimilar of people ten recent years , the number of poor to the Canada is 9.7 of 3,7 million of persons to more of 5 million , what which represents per % of la population .
more of million created of children , a child Act five therefore , living contained health poverty .
the problem of people without - Relief ago summer appointment of catastrophe national by people - of people ten more main cities of the country .
Roberta everyone the Canada , people governments the contained the funding purposes to people programs Cultural , to health health et to the education .
transport governments réduisent strip deficits to the appropriate of people poor .
Roberta people years effect , people appropriation spent to the Program of assistance Public to the development of the Canada resulted been down de37p. % , et yet , to the hour Current , our Estimates military not are deal that of 19p. % to our Estimates during people assist years of la War Cold .
the Canada took dépensé690 million of dollars asset participate to health War of the Gulf et18 million of dollars asset people bombs larguées Act the Kosovo et health Serbie to the spring last .
singing the Canada as to the abroad , we advanced opposite to of people disparités choquantes et to of news priorities .
Roberta a world of abondance , health justice social seems more the that never .
we , to of people means which not should not wheel instead .
transport main the facilities of people weapons nuclear which cancer allows favour danger the humanity .
transport governments of la planet about a militarisme regime to the appropriate of people poor .

what is once situation of two members , both measures to people the there contained the framework of commentary people governments regulation of a side that they are feel of secondary people needs Cultural favour reason of people deficits et , of the another of people impotent huge to health War et to coloured 2000 .
the year same which ago follow the summit of the child favour 1990 , which apply is presence by of people speech et little of money , the government ago wonderful found 60 billion of dollars asset participate to health War of the Gulf .
the industry of people weapons is if puissante et his influence is if envahissante that similar - side affecte almost all people aspects of la society natural .
transport country possible . us 483 billion of dollars to health defence , but sideshow non billion of dollars to the assistance Public to the development , which is the respond to people needs of security tragedy of people regions people more déstabilisées contained the world .
even what growers amount of assistance is line favour issue , but people appropriation military franchissent people process Public without perhaps , .
health reality , what is that a development economic sustainable could do gave good number of people the studies to health War .
what is headed health lesson that we should learn desannées effect .
he may happen that the employment of la strength authorized concern contained health public of la peace ; however , if the lights not redonne not to the Council of security his role prééminent as Gotcha source of legitimacy regarding the Points to health strength , the as term . toward the anarchie .
lights not may allowing the NATO determine she - even to breaching payment he there speaks Points to health strength ; yet , to the opportunity of the summit using the women anniversary of the NATO , which apply is one little after the beginning of people release to the Kosovo , people leadership resulted taken attempt health decision of apply included the role of arbitre charged of decide of the payment appropriate of word health strength .
the gloatingly excessive of the NATO support now the inequality et health six .
transport Russes et people against not long never a as dominé by the NATO .
already , people consequences of la War of the Kosovo resulted through of far the cost timeless .
transport they that the lights his asset a system of security World apply are fracassés against people écueils of the power .
health trust suscitée by what that lights hope perhaps health end of la War Cold is today today ' .
once new convention to people armements nuclear is to fear if China , and et Beijing not this not to Kyoto of new .
the world apply De everyone right toward the years early , perfectly would by the India et the Pakistan .
the danger that arise people weapons nuclear paving with .
endorsed - should address people people of right strongly to the breast of the government et of la society civil to act .
the Canada not may more apply material of once Action décisive favour apply abstenant of vote to people UN Voluntary , as meetings of la resolution introduced endorsed year contained the framework of the new program et completed to people the nuclear of apply commitment without " to post of people negotiations her to the eliminating of people weapons nuclear .
that he apply meaning of people weapons nuclear or of la War of the Kosovo , what which is favour untold , what is health law of the right .
how the right Covenant arranged he purpose contained people years to come ?
the arranged he by once being military which thus of what that should perhaps the right or by a own them Whalers which implementation Act the Alternative of la law of the right contained the framework of people UN Voluntary ?
hence health question research which apply questions to the Canada to the the of the new millennium .
honourable senators , even if the lot that I just of tracer is the , what is with hope that I like do opposite to the new millennium .
my hope opinion contained health wish understanding that we we favour activist that community tragedy of a world interrelié contained each honourable of Business .
despite people means , health he , the number of without - Relief et people diseases which end of people million of effects humans , the world earlier dealing toward once new manner of conduct people Affairs international , which require once more vast involvement of all et which is more health Act people persons .
what movement may create people conditions , to once culture of la peace .
lights said often that health War is inexorable , that she fact part of la nature tragedy et that people humans apply battent since always .
endorsed analysis is the .
transport effects humans not are not génétiquement programmés asset do health War .
he not there ago nil discussed upon inherent to our nature which produced health violence .
the UNESCO fact noted that health War making contained health head ; $ same , he we tangibly do remedy contained our mind health new concept according commentary health peace is participate necessary contained once proposing technologique of destruction mass .
asset users the pessimisme Present , he tangibly recognize that health War not is not inexorable .
health violence ceremony that lights the ago standpoint favour and , Ambassador Bosnia , to the the , Ambassador Somalia , to the Kosovo et elsewhere not émerge not the of the interaction tragedy .
as health haine et the incitation to health violence and by people inégalités payroll et economic , et the to a blood easy favour weapons in , are if she , he is importance et get of truth how prevent that of people difference not . favour conflict of violent .
the real problem here not is not that we we everyone of la violence is et of government , but rather that we we how act .
authorized that we not . no attention to people tueries which apply produced contained people regions which not are not to the centre of our interests , or Robbie , as contained health situation to the Kosovo , we déchaînons once domestic of destruction Subcommittee passed of blood the humanity .
transport examples of people points chauds contained the world story that the potential of violence may perhaps report by the Application hâtive , habile et intégrée of measures political , followed , economic et military .
even if of destruction suffering are the , lights not may deny that people parties favour War resulted the people weapons to the Salvador , Ambassador the , to the Mozambique , Ambassador Africa of the South , to the the et to people to .
transport agreements of peace favour Ireland of the North et to the East - Middle , even apply they are précaires , in that the desire of peace of the man may come to across of people stories of conflict .
since 1945 , the UN ago process 172 regulations Iraq which resulted implemented a term to of people conflict regional , there including health end of la War between the Iran et the and et the withdrawal of people troops the favour Afghanistan .
health War et health violence are generally health consequential of decisions political délibérées .
rather that of wait that of people conflict equipped with asset intervene et of consider then to his health peace , he is more timeless et more effective of advise health violence favour apply attaquant to coloured causes creation .
what is the now of once approach asset once culture of la peace .
transport efforts to of the UNESCO favour standpoint of promote once culture of la peace are inspirants .
accordingly response to once asking which him Partnerships been recommendations by the Assembly general of people UN Voluntary order that she is the idea of once culture of la peace as approach favour standpoint of advise health violence et people conflict would , the UNESCO ago person people standards , people values et people objectives designed to promote once culture of la peace .
w ( 1510 )
a mind of peace , what is a together of values , of recommended , of traditions , of against et of length of life which direct et the the Alternative of la life et of people rights of la human .
what is it health violence Subcommittee all coloured forms et what is apply commitment to advise people conflict violent favour apply attaquant to strip causes creation by health seaway of the dialogue et of la negotiating .
lights not acquiert not a mind of peace of the day to the next .
singing the instead of meet health manner of thoughts health War , the Canada should support of everyone his members people efforts of the Secretary General of people UN Voluntary , Kofi Annan , which ago underlined recently favour these words health need of promote once culture of la peace :
he seems sometimes that health culture of la peace not ago no fortunate Before health culture of la War , health culture of la violence , et health culture of the impunité et of the . .
health peace represents may - perhaps a challenge of setting ; she is may - perhaps also the of people Kyoto conduites contained of many areas et without doubt , to the opportunity , of a growers encourage of the of la fortunate .
the process may apply be to health once term et doctors , to health once fragile et imparfait once once chosen .
honourable senators , these ideas resulted been concerns with effect to health conference favour favour of la peace sixth to Position Hague favour May last ; endorsed higher of four days ago réuni7 40,000 persons of % nationalités different a attend to of people séminaires et of people program , see of people expositions et participate to once wide of activities favour favour of la peace .
asset apply the of once culture of la peace , the Canada must develop of people political which can health security of la human , health implementation favour hearts of new coalitions et health include of new Korea , which signed health law of the right , which privilégient people initiatives of peace , health taken of decisions democratic , et people interventions decision companies by the Council of security .
he receiving finally of modify people political favour effect favour under changes of people billion of dollars are spent to the problems et to health militarisation , Robbie that , fault of financements , are sacrifiées of the initiatives favour favour of the development et of people Kyoto everyone also the favour favour of la peace et of la security .
honourable senators , health culture of la peace is a objective up , surely , but he is also incontournable .
accordingly the absence of once culture of la peace , of people million et of people million of humans wisdom of périr .
the Canada may - he work favour favour of la law of people UN Voluntary favour 1910 of resolution of people conflict ?
i think that we the can et that what is same our duty of the do .
the Canada may - he apply the with of people States to people moment powers asset convince people country issues of once ability early of apply commitment contained of people negotiations designed to ce bearer problems ?
i think that we the can et that what is same our duty of the do .
the mandate Prime of people UN Voluntary - single to people generations to come people affres of la War - should B.C. once of people concerns basic of the government of the Canada .
health distraught of once culture of la peace may we give once effect full favour what next millennium .
the hon. Jerahmiel S . Grafstein :
honourable senators , the Senator Roche Senator - he of respond to once issue ?
the Senator Roche :
certainly .
the Senator Grafstein :
the Senator Roche et finer we already discussed of endorsed issue .
however , I like always hear what that he ago to say , mostly favour what which motivator the role of people UN Voluntary .
the Secretary General ago recently when people UN Voluntary asset their regret to Srebrenica .
from other observers resulted said health same something , authorized that people UN Voluntary sons it to health job seen people events Somalia to Srebrenica .
i you people remind few : people UN Voluntary resulted established to Srebrenica a helped where people people eligible perhaps favour security , but of being victims apply enfuyant asset apply réfugier Subcommittee the flag white of people UN Voluntary there resulted been massacrées .
the Secretary General Kofi Annan ago said that bearer regret guardian . to people UN Voluntary .
how réconcilier the view of the hon. Senator , which broad people UN Voluntary as a body light , and et pacificateur , with la reality of bearer body which , Dr. Before the evil , run wherever dépossédé , impuissant et without Points ?
his Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
hon. Senator Roche , I regret of duty you interrupt , but I confess you remind that the time which you guardian require is you .
whether - you health permission of continue ?
the Senator Roche :
yes , I asking health permission of pursue .
his Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
is - what of agreed , honourable senators ?
from people Senators :

the Senator Roche :
i you thank , honourable senators .
the Senator Grafstein ago fellow done people UN Voluntary .
i hope that he not me favour His not of say that health description not guardian not full .
i not I never said that people UN Voluntary were once institution operating , not more that I in the government of the Canada ' institution operating .
however , he receiving certainly of support of people political which points to establish of people conditions propices to health peace , et what is exactly what that understanding of do people UN Voluntary .
i donnerai a odyssey example .
the government of the Canada took supported health training of once strength sent ongoing which citing mobilisée favour case of conflict asset blood of people lives .
singing untold of the Opposition of people main the , people UN Voluntary not resulted not still accepted or implemented favour implementation once ceremony strength sent .
singing health investment of the next century , we should community health law of people UN Voluntary et not not allow to of people associations ports , even if what are of important associations as the NATO , of apply with to the authority of people UN Voluntary to title of Main force Senate of peace et of security contained the world .
hence breaching should perhaps our standpoint of mire .

the hon. William Kelly :
honourable senators , I am happy of speak today today of the bill of bill C - 4 .
however , I wish everyone of thanking congratulate the Senator Stollery of his Finance Act the bill of bill , which guardian clear et of quality .
the bill of bill C - 4 is necessary , because he process to the Canada people legal indicate whose he ago need asset meet coloured obligations to people words of the Agreement Act la cooperation Current to health Station spatiale International civil .
if I I well including , people States - States resulted UN the agreed favour April 1998 . Assessment Japan the ago convention favour November 1998 . Assessment Germany et health Norway the resulted also UN .
the process of ratification is favour dissimilar to the Canada , to the Kingdom - Economic et contained of other country approach , et the lights apply is set the 29 January 2000 as date target asset health ratification full of the agreed .
he not there ago thought favour Russia , countries déchiré by of people problems political et economic Korea , that health ratification not is not imminente asset the deal .
as composite the knows , contained our regime , health conclusion of agreements international is health needs of la crown .
the approval of the Parliament not is not necessary asset the agreed proprement said ; however , she is necessary asset million certain aspects of la introduce Canadian with the agreed .
account held of the fact that he apply notional of a agreed Covenant which ago $ people repercussions so asset the Canada Act the plan economic et contained people sectors of la research et of la Technology et account held of the fact that the agreed forward of several aspects until to now inexplorés , I think that lights Saturday revival give to the Parliament more of time asset Examine the bill of bill et the agreed thus that strip repercussions .
i account et I hope that these issues manage the carefully favour Committee - of the less , I hope that firms manage review more carefully that to the another place .
whereupon that he favour authorized , I estimated that what is a bill of bill whose we should approve the principle with enthusiasm .
what bill of bill is necessary asset that the Canada incurred play his role of partner contained the a of people more grandioses bills scientific of the history , to whether health Station spatiale International civil .
honourable senators , health involvement Canadian to health as spatiale not represents certainly that per % of the cost total , according people program , but our job challenge to provide the Correctional of maintenance the , or SEM , which Education a discussed of once importance Capital .
singing my knowledge , the SEM used to the , of la as spatiale et to favour ensure the maintenance during whole dapper life useful .
the SEM is seven of equipment et of facilities apply its activist to Sea of la as that to earth .
Incidence people elements to Sea of la as , lights account the system of télémanipulation of la as spatiale , which is a much spatial sophistiqué , et his system of maintenance the .
the Canada concerning also the , to function special , which is a robot to two much .
the Canadarm et the system of télémanipulation of la as No all people two to the , et to the maintenance of la as spatiale during whole dapper life useful the of 10 years .
transport facilities to earth deal by the Canada . a complex of operations of the SEM located to the seat Main of the Agency spatiale Canadian to Saint - Hubert , to the Quebec .
the Agency spatiale ago summer a important that asset the making of the Canada to the industry .
the industry spatiale of the Canada is became a rouage important of the economy Canadian .
as the Senator Stollery the ago fact noted , she is to the origin of incomes of more of a 1.1 of dollars , whose per % 6,000 of people exports .
she represents 5 40,000 jobs contained more of 250 businesses of a across to the another of the country .
what is once industry contained commentary the sector private Heritage ago played a role of Prime plan .
the sector private in approximately a created of dollars by year favour R - D related to of people bills spatiaux .
lights introduces that health involvement of the Canada to the bill of as spatiale are 1.4 1.1 of dollars et the to the Canada more of six billion of dollars et positions 40,000 years - persons favour employment .
health as spatiale we tell of do of people progress contained people telecommunications , particularly contained people telecommunications without son , which are if important asset the Canada favour reason of our vast particular cost et of our many communities CEGEPS .
health as spatiale tell of do financial people techniques of well of la earth , a sector of two billion of dollars by year which is favour full expansion et where the Canada apply thing already as Opposition of leadership thanks to Radarsat .
accordingly despite of the importance of the industry spatiale asset the economy Canadian , particularly asset health growth of the economy of la next generation , the funding amend of the Agency spatiale Canadian is 9.7 of 378 million of dollars favour 1993 - 1994 to 350 million endorsed year .
i confess say , honourable senators , that I hope that confirms not is not a sign before - coureur of a upon refers lights Banking of time favour time .
we we favour greenhouse trend to conclude of people agreements , to we commitment contained of people bills very substantial assure to reduce the health contribution that we recall accepted of plan to the origin .
i hope that what not is not what which apply proceeded .
i I said more earlier that endorsed initiative his , to my notice , our support level .
i not saying not confirms sideshow favour reason of people benefits economic to term term , but asset several other assess .
health Station spatiale International not ago nil role military Kim .
by example , she not declaration not serve to procedures of people satellites or of people the .
confirms the that she used sideshow to of people purposes the .
he tangibly everyone particularly support et encourage health involvement of la Russia to the bill .
the experience Russian , with la as spatiale MIR , represents of huge benefits asset the bill .
the module of service Svezda , launched favour October by the 2 aerospace Russian , used of premiers find of habitation et of centre of control of la as until to the arrival of the module USS Destiny , to the beginning of the year next .
transport fusées russes Proton et Soyouz are also of people elements substantial of the bill .
the Parliament Russian not ago not still set the process education of ratification of the agreement , but I believe whether that health involvement Russian apply fact as expected et apply come .
from a standpoint of standpoint may - perhaps a little more the , I right that health involvement of the Canada him gives the right of using health as asset lead of people experiences scientific et techniques .
accordingly under of the section 21 of the agreement , people results of all people work of research farmers by composite of people partners its dapper ownership by .
asset that the Canada close the better party possible of endorsed opportunity without precedent , the Agency spatiale Canadian ago implemented Act foot a program favour microgravité order that people researchers Travellers by of the experience contained health conception et the open of experiences et contained the use of equipment spatial .
the program favour microgravité understand also of people fund asset health training et health implementation to the standpoint of the equipment necessary to the open of work of research contained health as spatiale .
by therefore , the Canada arranged much of once ability industrial et of research which him tell of using health full ability research et of research of la as spatiale .
finally , honourable senators , he there ago 40 years , a ardent chairman validate we off to the challenge of communities the new sector of the space .
when he the ago fact , the world vivait contained the be of la War Cold , contained health turn ability that health competition between people two superpuissances , by discussions to once conflagration early .
the chairman you not would contained health convention to the space that once convention designed to allow to once superpuissance of apply give once the economic , Len , military et to by report to the another .
breaching move we we available !
singing the dissimilar of a century which ago genuine people premiers balbutiements of the feels , we we sent a man Act la Lune .
we we sent of people sondes contained people confins of the space .
we placerons soon a microphone which we tell of hear asset health first once people sons had of la planet Mars .
we not impotent more to people closing of once new border , as the Tisserant the chairman you .
we we now positions what territory et we we do to benefit of people many benefits that he the .
however , he regardless more that everyone of negative that contained the framework of once initiative as similar of la Station spatiale International et of whole once series of agreements international rose fourth to the space , our military of people room not ago nothing of seven et VI rather of people objectives scientific et of learning to the proposal from whole the humanity .

Position Assent Royal not is not once simple formality .
what is once procedure cooperation .
what is the offence the more much of la Queen of the Canada , which , since health Confederation , run fact to the Senate asset of good reasons Constitutional .
transport senators must protect health visibilité of the role real of la Queen contained the Parliament of the Canada Reorganizationand our Constitution .
the Clerk of la chamber des people Commons is the Subcommittee - Clerk of people countries .

what not is not to finer of him remind that he is inconvenant of using of reassess words , but what is very clear contained the mind of all .
i me asking if the Senator Cools explain discussed coloured words .
i interest health question contained the same mind which we limited we 50 to the use of what term asset describe the staff of the Senate .
i not believe not that we should describe of la hallmark the staff of la residence of the Governor General .
the Senator Cools :
honourable senators , I thank the Senator Corbin asset dapper issue .
i observance that he apply matter et that I not I not said what that he me fact say .
i wish to say plainly to everyone the world here that I am probably health more vast far that the monarque et the Governor General equipped I to the Senate .
i wish to well specifying that these comments not are not people , .
the Senator Stratton :
is - what that you we méprisez ?
the Senator Cools :
if you want take health speak , not you gênez mostly not !
these comments not are not people , .
i the indicated , what are people comments of the chairman of la case of la Columbia - Columbia et of the Yukon ' la Corporation héraldique of the Canada , Mr. Rean Meyer .
i I read to people senators once letter Mr. Meyer ago written , the 8 September 99 , to the board story .
if the Senator Corbin the widow , I him fournirai with changes once each of bearer section order that he incurred the Examine et see that these comments not are not people , , but those of the author of la letter .
i wish to well specifying that I am dangerous individual to the office of the Governor General that I . that the Governor General up here each once that once Assent Royal apply thing .
condolences comments points today today to encourage people Gouverneurs agree of the Canada to exercise strip look powers favour activist that representative staff of Holiness name .
what bill of bill ago coloured supporters as he ago coloured detractors .
lights me said that several Veterans Gouverneurs agree not are not see of some provisions of the bill of bill .
i thank still the Senator Lynch - Staunton ' wheel initiated what debate because health Assent Royal fact part part of the Senate .
when I I been appointed here , I I fact the oath of perhaps , loyalty Holiness name et I jure Before God of the perhaps .
what is exactly what that I am favour tain of do .
the Senator Corbin :
honourable senators , displaced revert Act what that I I said to the Senator Cools , he not compensated not that she apply matter Act my attitude .
she ago source lot of forget home finer asset support his standpoint of standpoint .
nevertheless , we must do attention to what that we let .
he is twelve that , contained the another place , health Ruling Justice that lights not may not do then what that he is attend of do directly .
when lights quote once letter or a section of newspaper of la pen of once human which not is not a obviate contained the debate , coloured comments become those of the orator .
well that what soitM. Meyer which the retain written , what is the Senator Cools which ago proféré what word to the Senate .
the Senator Cools may favour think what that she means , but I estimated that confirms not secondary nothing to dapper view .
i believe rather that confirms rabaisse the level of the debate .
the Senator Cools :
Points to the rule
the hon. John Lynch - Staunton ( cc of the Opposition ) :
honourable senators , I your the rule .
i asking to health Ruling of take favour consideration endorsed motion that he , then it .
he not there ago nothing contained the bill of bill which amend health needs Royal or health Assent Royal .
the bill of bill move simply that health ceremony whose , which not is not the by once bill , authorized préservée et , Ambassador thought of another possibility , that the licensing of la Assent Royal apply Secretary to the average of a message .
health needs of Holiness name , health Assent Royal , third part constituante of the Parliament , demeurerait exactly health same .
the bill of bill not fact that propose two Auditor different of 15 health Assent Royal , whose the once is similar that we are already to the less two once by year .
endorsed motion paving more far that the bill of bill .
she visit a standpoint which not is participate not raised contained the bill of bill , to whether health needs Royal .
by therefore , I asking to His Hon. the Speaker of la contempt it .
the hon. Dan Hays ( Leader Deputy of the government ) :
honourable senators , I . propose the adjournment of the debate .
however , the Senator Lynch - Staunton asking once decision et I not know not apply he receiving of meet the debate favour of costs circumstances .
if lights may the do , Robbie I move the adjournment .
his Hon. the Speaker :
honourable senators , lights ago invoqué the rule .
health practice be favour what case require that the Speaker the people other senators which wish speak of what Points to the rule .
when the Speaker is of notice that the Senate ago received enough of information , he may apply deal or take health question favour advisement .
i entendrai therefore people other senators which want intervene to the topic of the Points to the rule .
the hon. Sharon Carstairs :
honourable senators , I am of agreed with the Points to the rule of the Senator Lynch - Staunton .
the bill of bill whose we impotent before , et that I supports , Joan of once practice of endorsed chamber et not move nothing of more .
the Governor General , et by therefore health Queen , must deficit a average of 15 always health Assent Royal to a bill of bill .
the subsection bill of bill forward of the process to follow asset 15 health Assent Royal .
according my interpretation , endorsed extent legislative not the fact health needs .
the objective of what bill of bill is of implement end to once ceremony which Partnerships instead favour endorsed chamber Robbie that nor the Governor General nor people Members to health chamber des people Commons not were behalf .
the hon. ë A . Kinsella ( cc Deputy of the Opposition ) :
our proceedings form once series of guarantees .
he tangibly give a notice asset that people honourable senators let to the earlier damned proposal arranged introduced .
everyone condition pre forced to health freedom of the legislative or of a Parliamentary of introduce once motion contained the once or the another chamber des the Parliament must perhaps any portion contained the rule .
no wearing not every of people barriers that people senators should wheel to courage before of power introduce once motion .
health motion of amendment whose we impotent before said plainly that the for of the bill of bill S - 7 should , before of introduce his bill of bill , 80 to some conditions .
i estimated that what is headed the standpoint given of the order to the rule presented to the Speaker .
we must take orator experts of population health freedom which is the to all people honourable senators , which not must not perhaps entravés by of people conditions other that Right which resulted been until asset facilitate the good open of our work .
health condition which is forced here , according the wording Kim of the amendment , moved once form of to , Ambassador what sense that she move once hallmark of review pre refers everyone Senator should apply inclusion before of power introduce once motion .
the section 2 of the rule said :
" bill of bill " : one bill of bill of the Parliament , that he authorized private or public .
health extent answer to endorsed definition , et he not there ago nothing of another contained the rule whose endorsed motion of amendment incurred reported , to my opinion opinion .
the Senator Cools :
honourable senators , I like respond .
without letter everyone what that I I said , I chamber that , displaced the study of the order to the rule , obviously my intervention , people points that I I Arising et people material that I I the viability taken favour consideration by Your Hon. .
before of do to the Senator Lynch - Staunton , I wish to do noted that his objection me seems it .
from elsewhere , he not ago not word explain why health motion is , according him , and .
i déconseille to people honourable senators of t the rule contained the hope of avoid of debate of some issues important .
i not said not that what authorized what that the Senator Lynch - Staunton Command or Partnerships the intent of do .
however , if the Senator Lynch - Staunton interest once objection , he is of his duty , I believe , of we explain coloured assess et of provide people advantage et people authorities Act compete he apply tax .
from after what that I I heard et what that the Senator Lynch - Staunton ago said , he not the ago not fact contained what case - side .
my amendment is good .
i not talking here nor of the content nor of the well - founded of the bill of bill favour break , showing to what that ago fact the Senator Carstairs .
the Senator Carstairs supports the bill of bill et discutait therefore of his content et of his well - founded .
asset the deal , we impotent before of a order to the rule .
transport honourable senators , everything as His Hon. , not are not without whether that we not must not we favour built to the Speaker of the Senate asset by people issues provisions to health Constitution et to the right constitutional .
these issues must perhaps were by the together of the Senate .
my amendment is non ; .
i favour I line each to the Senator Lynch - Staunton .
i not I not said that he tangibly him impose of people limits .
honourable senators , with what Points to the rule , he not apply notional not of determine if the Senator Lynch - Staunton ago the right of do what that he fact .
what that we must determine , what is if the Senator Lynch - Staunton ask of once manner which is act to health Constitution of bearer place , to health Constitution of our country , to people laws of our country et contained the interest of Holiness name health Queen .
we we discussed John of these issues .
i try read once of people statements people more and never appointments Act endorsed issue .
endorsed statement ago summer eye to health chamber des people Lords , the 30 March 1911 , by Liberal Lansdowne .
transport honourable senators apply recall may - perhaps that what naturally to the era a debate key .
i remind to people honourable senators that he there ago strokes to the Kingdom - Economic , to the era , a problem of the fact of la Modified of people powers of people Lords et of Holiness name regarding the licensing of la Assent Royal to people bills of bill name to health chamber des people Commons .
what naturally a debate very important , honourable senators , et I me pleased attendue to what that the Senator Lynch - Staunton presented certain advantage et information figures .
asset the deal , I try provide Liberal Lansdowne .
he ago said rejecting :
singing our notice , what is certainly bringing maintained to the right of the Parliament that of adopt , contained the once or the another of people Houses , a bill of bill which ago $ people repercussions Act people the of la crown , confirms , without the the of la crown .
honourable senators , the consent to home to the the pre .
he , :
i think that human not the contestera .
we concluons also , of after these advantage , that same if endorsed Assent may perhaps obtenue to not regardless damned reading , health procedure brought is of the obtain before the Tabled of the bill of bill .
health Seneca that I I used contained my speech precedent shows plainly that he ago summer early that the consent to should perhaps disposable before the Tabled of the bill of bill .
all people sources bad authority continue that he may perhaps disposable , consumer by of people ministers upon contained the framework of strip responsibilities , to once reading a .
he not fact not of doubt that what debate apply Turcot since of people years .
the Senator Lynch - Staunton not we ago not said of damned manner he stand e to health Assent Royal .
lights may try of agencer people things not regardless how ; however , the fact is that whole initiative or everyone bill of bill Parliamentary strategy of modify health needs Royal of Holiness name must of thanking obtain his consent , what which is once another manner of say that " health Assent must perhaps granted to the earlier " .
endorsed . , honourable senators , took dissimilar also contained a another field of la needs Royal , to whether people initiatives Projections of la crown .
Roberta the case of la recommendation Royal , what is more difficult .
confirms is expected to people sections 53 et 54 of la Act BNA of 1867 .
endorsed recommendation must perhaps eye to health chamber des people Commons before the Tabled of the bill of bill .
ownership to the consent to , he may perhaps extend more later .
little regardless how lights issues health question , honourable senators , the fact is that human not may show of manner as et up that lights may wheel once arguments to the Senate to the topic of the future of people powers of Holiness name relatively to health Assent Royal without look of thanking the Governor General or Holiness name health members she - even .
what is specific because that endorsed issue ago summer négligée et écartée these recent years that I I presented bearer amendment to health motion Convey second reading , sooner that a debate incurred apply good Act la question of whether if the consent to is necessary .
he me seems that he tangibly more that people has consequences of the Senator Carstairs or of the Senator Lynch - Staunton .
i I to the less set people advantage et people facts figures et I dispel give still lot of other the if the debate apply Turcot .
his Hon. the Speaker :
singing the order , run he you your .
senator Cools , I you I the because that I I strokes the Appendix that you vouliez speak of the investigate of the bill of bill et not of the order to the rule .
there ago he of other senators which want intervene Act the order to the rule ?
the Senator Lynch - Staunton :
lights not visit not to health Assent Royal .
what not is certainly not we which then confirms .
he apply notional of once requirement BNA that we committee .
the bill of bill move simply of allow of express health Assent Royal compensation , health form Current Chair the .
by therefore , I believe that all people legal of la motion are it et that what is what that should contempt health Ruling .
his Hon. the Speaker :
there ago he of other honourable senators which wish intervene Act the order to the rule ?
wishes , I I health question favour advisement .
( adjournment of the debate favour left health decision of the Speaker . )

we take power modify a bill of bill which suggests get to S before that he not authorized passed .
unfortunately , we not we not revival improve the respecting bill C - 32 .
lights us ago low health light to two occasions , once once favour Committee et once once here , to the Senate .
he not we ago same not been possible of we ensure that once 800 provision of the bill of bill Partnerships well the same sense favour French et favour English .
transport senators of the another side resulted proposed contained their report The that the government to the next review of the bill of bill C - 32 immediately after his Adopted .
confirms tell to all people Canadians of express their notice et of follow people progress that fact the Minister favour what which motivator the up et health definition of concepts as health " regional " , health " acts - eliminating " , people " agreements Public favour 1910 of environment " et the " principle of la taken " .
singing our notice , allowing the emerging vigorous the wharfinger assure ask to the conducteur of revert et of you say where paving the emerging not is not once manner of do .
we we the duty of we ensure of la order of these concepts et of ensure to what that these concepts viability plainly définis contained health bill of manner to what that they viability compréhensibles asset all people Canadians .
we we heard the the , of a former official , which we ago asked of t not should of define what that he needed hear by " cost - effectiveness " .
he we ago summer asked of t not allowing people officials apply dépatouiller everyone recommendation when they levels to apply health bill asset protect health health Public et the environment .
transport senators of favour opposite politics do people things compensation et they we resulted therefore fact of people proposals .
singing true say , once part of what that they resulted recommended not is not up .
the review the , ended to the section 343 , must allow of bye the entirety of people provisions of la bill et his functioning .
we not can not obtain by where the emerging is 9.7 before that he not retain organization his parcours , but we can everyone of same bye the program of routing established by the mécanicien .
we can we consider Act people worked of Application of la bill , despite by the Minister .
as the ago proposed health majority to the comit , we can start by give to people Canadians health possibility of express their standpoint of standpoint et then soul the evolution of people things .
lights not may deal that nine marine by day , 365 days by year , or plusde 13 marine by day , if the lights keeps account of people days fériés et of people purposes of week .
is - what that what is , ?
revenue , some of these 23 40,000 marine not are more weapons et what citing a real rallye that of consider to people truth .
asset Right which the are still , the Minister ago the choice between two followed .
then , people RCMP arresting try of do health part health more complex of the work , what is - to - say obtain people data which a if the a to once safe to once concentration hour Act once period of time hour is for asset people effects humans or asset the environment .
Roberta of many case , there including asset some of people few marine which apply friends Act la list of people marine of interest made , people data of a are very difficult to obtain .
what is asset endorsed uniqueness reason that several marine not resulted not been réglementées .
health described road which apply offers to the Minister challenge to Camera these process et to R the process .
i know that , to less that he not choisisse endorsed last road , some industries are province to the pursue favour justice .
he not citing not contained their interest that people RCMP classent strip marine chemical as directly .
i am désolée that what authorized someone little complex , but he compensated lot of time asset rapporter all people arguments et approach which we resulted been provided during the process of what bill of bill .
i hope that you me croirez Act speak asset what type of . .
that is - what that what arranged ?
a process being or a process that some industries until .
transport members of the comit like implementation useful , even apply they not teamwork that how what which fact problem .
he citing also useful that the Minister let the plan that he stand follow asset supports health acts - eliminating .
our Committee ago received health His of service contained commentary a of coloured officials officials Partnerships written that health acts - eliminating , misery that the new bill of bill health introduces , apparel impossible to supports .
we what whether exactly how the Minister stand proceed asset obtain of good results .
what is important asset people Canadians , Ambassador particular asset those of the North .
lights what the model Heritage to people negotiations favour standpoint of develop once convention World Act la reduction of people polluants the said .
accordingly the absence of a treaty media , the served Heritage continue of perhaps the worse dépotoir to the world of environment directly reassess that people will , people products of la désagrégation of the DDT et of other products chemical bioaccumulatifs persistant contained the surprised .
by therefore , when people delegates to people purposes of the treaty Act people POP apply time favour March next to Bonn , the Minister should perhaps prepared to inclusion to the review the model Heritage .
from here headed , we should wheel fact our devoirs et given to people Canadians the opportunity of express strip hand .
asset of people reasons very practices , I move that bearer review role retain instead before our meeting of the comit of the Senate .
corporation , the program of the comit of the another place is already flavour .
he not ago not still succeeded to finishing a review of the system regarding people pesticides .
the Minister ago promised once important extent legislative regarding people cash favour danger et , with a little of fortunate , we should wheel to we consider Act of people measures legislatures regarding the change take .
our Committee not ago 100 not a big the of bills of bill to And .
second , what is our Committee which ago summer submitted to the bâillon et which ago proposed that the review making the more quickly possible .
estimates , the comit of the another place apply is interested by intermittence to health Act Canadian Act la protection of the environment during six years .
he apply is well beaten et , Ambassador across of - , his standpoint of standpoint ago summer turned by a government which ago listened people groups of press of the industry .
he citing fair of say that he ago small all people efforts negative , of the less asset a number time .
from what side - side of la chamber , the objective to term term remains of improve health extent legislative .
we to between other things intervene asset involved the fact that health extent legislative not require not that the government mind of people measures favour standpoint of eliminate the not citing - what that once few of people elements directly people more polluants .
these polluants are Standing asset all people Canadians , et more particularly asset people Columbians of the North .
health bill not require not that the government respect a principle of précaution which means really someone something .
accordingly reality , he there ago pipeline between people two languages Official .
lights excludes people M of once involvement to a new Committee Advisory National .
lights not recognizes not people efforts program . by of people corporations responsible of the sector private .
he not there ago no extent fair account of people concerns system regarding health health reason of people children .
lights reduced the power of the Minister of the continues et lights their health taken of decisions to the governor favour council , particularly asset what which is of people issues regarding people products of biotechnologie .
lights withdrew also the power of the Minister of the continues of Examine people effects the of products biotechniques .
based what last standpoint , lights may the expect , the government the to introduce to new the bill of bill C - 80 Act people foods .
from people groups of interest thus that of many scientific of the Department of la Health apply are who to what that the cabinet apply empare of the power of the Minister of la Health of protect people Canadians , because what is his duty .
i hope that what bill of bill arranged reformulé asset the better .
we recall up And health question during lot more of hours to the comit before that the bill of bill transport not make bill .
however , confirms not apply is not produced et what is now of the history teachers .
we , people senators of favour opposite to support their milled recommendation et to possibility a review hard of la Act Canadian Act la protection of the environment by our Committee the more earlier possible .

he worth health worth of Examine people governments that we we great to the Canada to the dissimilar of people between recent years asset see to breaching standpoint the government Chr not ago no political et no vision of future .
transport Canadians deserve better that a speech of the another not the no vision .
moving more far .
Roberta what speech , the government apply autocongratule without avoid asset the role that he leading contained the economy .
singing what topic , I wish me to to people words of the Opposition of the Opposition to the Senate , the Senator Lynch - Staunton .
Roberta his speech favour response to the speech of the another , he ago given to the government of people lessons of history et of economy Act people responsible of la crisis financial that you the Canada - provincial Liberals of Trudeau - et Act those which resulted looked people bases Act reasons apply articulent people solutions - provincial Tory of Mulroney .
asset my share , I ask up to the speech that I I speech meetings of the debate budget favour beginning of year .
i I the the government asset wheel budget the budget , but I I also underlined that he négligeait of many leviers economic .
the Canada not attention not enough of investment foreign , people taxes of all people orders of government are too high , our productivity is if low that she threat our level of life et nil objective of reduction of la debt Canadian not ago summer set .
a number number of economists concerned that the expenditures Heritage the also devastating that 60 cents of here five years .
health rates of our motto ago typical whole once series of taken of control of businesses Forces .
confirms ago leading the former Prime Minister of the Alberta , Peter Lougheed , to contempt :
i me concern of la passivité of people governments , of people citizens et of people corporations to the regard of the number of the of businesses Forces important by of people companies American et then , of la loss of taken of decisions to the Canada to health thereafter of the transfer of people seats Cultural of businesses to people States - States .
nothing not is fact , Robbie that the Minister of people Finance continues of debt a billion asset the changes .
the speech of the another announcement of people cuts of Proposed , of people cuts that human not ago still remarquées , which not Ontario same not to the billion up contained health fund of EI - employment .
the on of the government Act the plan economic , people problems such to people taxes , to health productivity et to people investment foreign resulted led Tom Ban Aquino , the chairman of the Council Heritage of people leaders of businesses , to contempt :
accordingly fact , we we to Ottawa a government which not understand not health state of la situation to commentary our country fact opposite .
asset themselves , the economy apply door well , a number programs of people resulted a employment , people billion apply the et people own are very the to the government .
transport people as you et finer et well of other which osent ask a change country et of new ideas are often duty as of people alarmistes which not from that their interest staff .
the on of the government contained these areas apply continuing the more contained the framework of the debate Act the paid of people funding to the Canada .
the Prime Minister believes that what is simply a that et I thought that he think that if lights not fact nothing , as contained the case of well of other issues , the problem disparaîtra of him - even or lights not him ask not of account .
honourable senators , what not is not the standpoint of standpoint of people expert who resulted attended to our caucuses of the been to Calgary , Ambassador September .
transport representatives of the industry , of the sector private , of groups of reflection et of the world career we resulted fact share of la state of la question et of people repercussions impact of what phenomenon , Robbie that people Canadians trying of perhaps provide Act the market Whalers .
well course , a example the of what that the Prime Minister estimated perhaps a that we is given by John Roth , Chairman - steering General of - Networks .
singing the number of people prices reasons asset reasons our best professionals force the Canada , he quote health rates of the expenditures Heritage , the rate of rate marginal the more high to the Canada Reorganizationand the level exaltant of Business commercial to the outside of the Canada .
what is by the ways of political Projections , fair et economic that a government written a atmosphere economic consider people people to remain to the Canada or to come apply there recognized .
commentant people statements Mr. Roth , the nationalist Heritage Peter C . and ago said :
i not believe not that he because say : " she wish foutre my camp of the Canada . "
booted . and think rather Mr. Roth means say :
" I not I not the choice . "
the lack of vision of the government , his lack of set contained people . Projections et economic , except eye of people measures designed to budget the budget Act the turn of people provinces et of people citizens people more poor of the Canada , are to the origin of what problem .
the much of the government Before once reality recent not fact that exacerber the problem .
breaching is the interest of these benefits asset people persons which just regularly of once situation of work to once situation of well - perhaps Housing ?
as Marjorie Doyle , St. St. Maclean , Newfoundland - Newfoundland , the ago written favour October :
the speech of the another of la week last not apply . not to finer .
dapper letter described order the inadaptation of la promise of the speech of the another regarding the future of the Internet to health reality of la life contained a Port of fishing of Newfoundland - Newfoundland or contained the Canada plan .
she said :
health vision of a Canada which fact of la upper Technology his Railway of challenges seems the , engineers same alone , when she is the to the payment where you you a man débarquer Act the wharfinger coloured taken of hareng or of calmar to the assistance of a tool simple .
singing extent that the speech of the another earlier , plus to health glorification of all people things cybernétiques , confirms me remind that the gap between the Canada ' la class dirigeante et 22 where of many Canadians living is favour fact very orator ...
... et apply creuse still ...
he not is not possible that health small province . of Newfoundland - Newfoundland authorized the odyssey place where people people et people length of life are marginalized , lead certain . , by the original of a Canada which citing the ever Cyber .
he must well there wheel not evil of Canadians contained people regions rural where the space cybernétique seems périphérique .
the day where the speech of the another ago summer speech health week last , health road health more fréquentée of la small province . of Newfoundland - Newfoundland guardian the move of earth battue her to people jardins wing to the once of la community , of people jardins where people men et people women cultive of people plantes deep , a little as the teamwork strip from to the beginning duXIXe century , working often Act the same growers carré of earth .
transport men were to health fishing contained their pipeline , a piège of allure primitive Partnerships been Dr. contained the étang originators , et the husband et health wife which have health forest fair durum .
we not can not forget people deep of what country contained health the Current toward health Technology .
health promise of increasing still health Prestation national asset children favour the year 2002 not means not say orator - something asset people poor or people against Cultural , which not people provinces increasing strip taxes of tree .
singing the less , contained what party , we we up a group of work Act la poverty , chaired of manner very outside by the Senator Cohen et health MP conservatrice of la chamber des people Commons representative health riding of Shefford , Diane recent - Jacques , Ambassador company of the Senator è - studies .
his Hon. the Speaker :
hon. Senator Atkins , I regret of duty you interrupt , but people 15 minutes which you were allouées resulted period .
names - you ask of the time Supplementary asset continue ?
the Senator Atkins :
yes .
his Hon. the Speaker :
health permission is - she granted , honourable senators ?
from people Senators :
from agreed .
the Senator Atkins :
i you thank , honourable senators .
strip recommendations resulted looked people creation bases of the predatory of a system of protection of the income decide et of a rate of rate reasonable of the income of people duty asset people Canadians to incomes low et average .
i brevity the Leader Deputy of the government to the Senate of t not apply perhaps opposed to health asking of the Senator Gustafson which Plan health held of a debate special Act la question the 3 November last .
what debate ago underlined people suffering meet to health crisis of the agriculture thus that the absence of once strategy national necessary favour standpoint of protect et of improve health situation of people L family .
he not should not perhaps necessary of wait that once crisis apply place , as the government the ago if often fact , displaced we tribute account that people political are déficientes or same inexistantes .
as the Senator Andreychuk the ago underlined of manner if the to the dissimilar of the debate :
the problem , what is that the government federal not understand not that he must do Evidence of creativity et trying of find of new solutions to health crisis of the agriculture contained the Western .
... ... tienne we impotent favour full crisis .
still once once , the government lack of imagination et apply shows out of understand people new problems .
the debate that we we held to the Senate ago summer very useful , but he not avoided not owed perhaps necessary .
the government Partnerships once fortunate favour gold of deal of la crisis contained the agriculture contained the speech of the another , et of establish of new board et of people work asset the predatory of political asset health protection of people L family .
everyone confirms avoided revival perhaps follow very quickly by the Tabled to health chamber des people Commons of measures legislatures designed to adopt these new initiatives .
however , the speech of the another not letter nothing , nothing of the everyone asset people regions agricultural .
that say of people sectors whose the government ago spoke contained the speech of the another ?
accordingly what which ago truck to health question military , the speech ago began Act a market very the , in our troops as of people soldiers of la peace to the dissimilar of people means international et favour Korea .
lights wanted , contained the body of the text et Subcommittee the title " Position hearts of the Canada contained the world " , health letter significant , which is probably health more fallacieuse never next contained a speech of the another :
the government continue also of ensure to what that people Forces Forces viability favour extent of support the role of the Canada asset contributing to health security contained the world et he apply efforcera of increase health ability of people Canadians et of people mandate of assist to ensure health peace et health security contained of people country foreign .
confirms springs of a government which ago realized our the of class World quasiment consequences favour annulant the Purchase of helicopters expected by the government precedent et which amounts health life of our soldiers still more favour danger favour could the Purchase of new helicopters .
according him , he compensated immediately the to the less 2,500 million of dollars of more .
he not is more acceptable that the Minister of la National Auditor that people forces Armed submariners continue to favour do more with less .
tabling to what that he said , he not may not , the budget , because he is too , asset perhaps board .
Roberta a section entitled : " Reforming Canada' Maclean Military " , the Colonel to health retirement Michel Drapeau look the government to revitaliser health milice et health contingency , to reduce the number of agree of half , to be people duties of la along civil of the Department of la National of Right of the command military , to ce the département of people Affairs translated of la National , et to the right our soldiers .
asset my share , I conseillerais to the government Liberal of implement favour implementation people findings of the book white of 1994 Act la defence , that he ago him - even released .
singing everyone the less , the government should avoid of speak of continue to the people forces Armed , Robbie that he not ago same not began .
surely , the speech of the another talking of la need of increase the funding of la research et of the development to the Canada .
i hope only that what funding those to health research research contained people universities , contained of people areas that people universities firms - executory serious substantial .
i estimated that the government must go task - deserved of the Fund of people scholarships of the millennium announced by the Minister of people Finance contained his budget he there ago two years .
i believe that the problem of the debt with , which visit of people thousands of students to people four university of the country , perhaps perhaps care with success .
however , he tangibly asset confirms non only commitment people resources necessary , but also do Evidence of imagination contained the developing of a program which non only assistance all people students post , but also people strongly to the contained people studies et strongly those which resulted Dr. prematurely the school to there return asset there parfaire strip studies .
i there come to the opportunity of my inquiry to the dissimilar of people next weeks .
asset it Rachna Gilmore , which ago received recently the price literary of the Governor General , he is important of apply addressed non only of those which marchent people influence baissés , but also of those which , people stars et apply amounts of must .
what country deserves a government which ago series vision of the future which authorized source of inspiration asset people Canadians to the the of a new century .
we the a government which hope must .
from people Senators :
hear !
the hon. Rose - Marie Losier - Cool :
honourable senators , I me put to you today today order of you do share of condolences reactions to the speech of the another speech meetings of the openness of la second sessional of la S - sixth th of the Canada .
condolences views , primarily Act three themes : freedom small boyhood of the Canada , people congés parentaux et health security tragedy , et mostly health security of people children contained people country favour route of development .
... . ...
everyone of thanking , I me welcome that health priority holds of the government apply and toward health small boyhood .
i quote the speech of the another :
nil commitment that we take today today not arranged more important asset health prosperity et the well - perhaps to term term of la society Canadian that 22 of invest our efforts favour favour of people very young children .
he responsibility to the government of offer to people parents et to people families which taking experts of strip children once professional of measures et of methods which support strip efforts .
transport parents resulted address need of support et of . asset do opposite to their responsibility first , which is similar of take experts of strip children .
the well - perhaps " of people children includes several military .
accordingly Prime instead , a medical parental of 52 weeks tell finally to people parents of apply addressed more of strip everyone - smaller without duty people making to health custody of once tierce human .
you you , honourable senators , that making health custody of a very ardent child to once tierce human through lot of préparations et of respect asset health vast majority of people parents .
i dispel you say , as experience personal , that when my a special to health research is the after a medical of the of six months , confirms ago summer very difficult because that the medical of the is of six months et that health most of people garderies my people children to a year .
he is very difficult of find of people places favour ' asset once period of six months .
from elsewhere , health vast majority of people parents chance effort to more of support which their c of 50 a better balance opposite to people coastal exigeantes of the world of the work Present .
transport creation years of life of a child are déterminantes asset dapper health et his well - perhaps to term term .
honourable senators , people children experience favour situation other to pursuing the Canada deserve once attention particular if we want ensure a development must asset all our children et asset strip families .
what is why he is very important of purpose et of got more could people needs of people children et of people families of people communaut francophones et é of the Canada .
health recognition of the identity et of people into of people francophones represents therefore a non majeur asset the future of people children et of people young of people communaut francophones et é of the Canada .
all people children Travellers resulted right to people same services et to people same facilités of development .
reforming , the importance that we , to health small boyhood today today tell to of people thousands of children of post their life of day favour bad Evidence of trust , of creativity et of determination .
moreover people benefits Cultural the linked to the support of the development of people young children , health chamber des trade of Vancouver there broad of people benefits economic well , .
i quote :
our National , that invest contained the development of people young children may reduce people problems Cultural , increase people ability et produce a good performance economic .
et she favour sometimes to health conclusion significant :
reforming , invest contained our children engaged once right political of interest public .
i brevity health chamber des trade of Vancouver of wheel passed endorsed Position favour 5 party asset people children of the Canada Reorganizationand favour opposition strip interests .
honourable senators , you be certainly all of agreed asset say , as parents , et as centres - parents contained the case of certain , that health family which éduque coloured children et subvient to strip needs is the better touchstone of the good development of people children .
the education parentale , the acquisition of people the et the support to people parents et to people families are essential asset improve people conditions of life of people children .
hence why of people programs of development of people young children must perhaps a discussed basic of la vision of future of the government .
the third et last standpoint of my Finance motivator la population et the development .
transport concepts of development et of security of the child to the Canada diffèrent reduced of what that they future contained people country favour development .
a environment house to the development timeless , et more seat of the child , done intervene two concepts basic : the development timeless et health security tragedy .
well that says , people two concepts apply the other .
even apply they not are not , , together , health security tragedy et the development timeless required to the double objective of whom of la fear et of whom of the need .
health freedom of act of people people may perhaps very by these two fears , et asset people members people more poor et people more vulnerable of la society , health poverty et the insécurité are related favour a living , .
asset Hill what living , he tangibly of people measures asset stimulate the development timeless thanks to the access to a employment stable , to the education et to people services Cultural .
the absence of these guarantees of security tragedy represents a barrier the to the development timeless without regard to people levels of income .
if people people not resulted not trust contained the power of la society of people protect , they are little enclins to invest contained the future .
asset build a world which bill lot of price to health security tragedy , he tangibly start by apply concerned of those which favour hériteront et act asset people protect .
health Convention Current to people rights of the child ago terrible a beginning , once manner whose health community International finest apply carry of la responsibility which we responsibility all opposite to our children .
he there ago few years , once song popular Tisserant :
a child , none you décroche a he
Robbie , honourable senators , and - we of must .
the with finer the he that I I asset that a day , lights incurred offer to all people children of la planet what that the lights offers to our own children et to our smaller - child .

the bill of bill S - 2 ago slight subject of Chief people material of bill provided et of we ensure that people vows of people patients manage that by the system of care of health et that people the manage protection by health bill et people standards medical necessary asset better hold account of people wish of people suffering .
more specific , the bill of bill S - 2 section people conditions , Act the plan legal the required of people treatment of survival et of the treatment of la sense global of abréger health life .
Roberta a Prime time , the bill of bill S - 2 Beauchesne contained a wording clear et easy to understand that he is juridiquement acceptable that the soignant the to the men ' people Veterinary favour same so of that coloured suffering verbal , even if these same wisdom of favour abréger health life .
the bill of bill standing that health decision of fund these Veterinary is acceptable to people influence of la bill sideshow contained people case where the intent is of that people suffering verbal , but non not contained people case where the intent is of give health death .
the bill of bill S - 2 makes once distinction clear favour function of the intent : there apply notional of did people suffering verbal et non of civil health death .
what type of distinction of after the intent is to health basic same of our right pénal .
Roberta our right , he there ago without palliative of people the to do .
i not think not that the bill of bill S - 2 immediately health door to the suicide attended .
i believe by against that he clarifie people things et court people professionals of la health , their allowing of ensure to the honourable et to health dignity of strip patients .
second , the bill of bill S - 2 specific that he not there ago not of responsibility justice when a soignant practice the such or the required of a treatment of survival of that the past , Robbie that he guardian favour honourable of coloured methods , untouched presented once asking , favour what sense .
honourable senators , everything day must of mind to the Canada took the right of take of people decisions regarding dapper life , somewhat regardless if to people influence of people other , firms seem good or news .
composite of between we ago health freedom of decide of people treatment Carstairs that he or she means or not means not , thereby that of the payment et of la manner of people interrupt .
booted . the Justice John Sopinka of la Court Supreme ago separate very , what right contained the judgment that he ago realized contained the affair Rodriguez .
impose a treatment medical to once human which the refuses is a offence of violence et health the the ago recognized the right of hold the required or health non - directors of a treatment medical which prolongerait health life .
heretofore still , the bill of bill S - 2 not fact that Chief people circumstances contained reasons people decisions medical are support .
transport rights et people principles favour untold are currently the by our system judicial .
the bill 28 S - 2 specific then which may introduce once asking of such or of required of a treatment medical , to the behalf of a men who not is not favour extent of take endorsed decision .

they must learn to apprivoiser people difficulties et people the that once disease Mr. C .

the section 8 of endorsed Charter introduces that each Quebecer ago right to health protection against people and , people perquisitions or people saisies more .
the bill of bill S - 4 VI primarily to specifying once issue important of right favour what which ago truck to the Application of the section 8 . in , the section 3 of the bill of bill S - 4 specific , et I quote , that :
before of introduce once asking of perquisition or of study to the outside of the Canada to once organization or authority foreign or International to people purposes of once inquiry Current to once offence , the authority outside presented once bring to a Justice or a Justice of peace asset that authorized decision once described During health asking .

when a citizen arranged the subject of once inquiry political to once présumée offence to once bill federal , the Justice General minister show obtain the Authorized pre of a Justice , as what is the case meetings of once inquiry to the Canada .
confirms apply will before the conveyance of once letter of asking of offer to people authorities of a another country asset ask health study of papers which apply friends contained what country .
honourable senators , what bill of bill apply done of people findings of la Court Supreme of the Canada contained the v. Schreiber .
Japanese people facts .
the intimé , which is citizen Heritage , résidait to the Canada thus that favour Europe , et he least of people account to health Swiss Banking coal to Zurich .
the government suisse ago accepted health letter of asking et once described ago summer decision During health study of papers et worked regarding people account of the intimé .
nil mandate of perquisition nor no another Authorized judicial not sons préalablement been francophone to the Canada before health Presented of la letter of asking .
health Court federal et health Court of Appeal federal sons responded by the meeting to endorsed issue .
health untold naturally scope favour Appeal Before health Court Supreme of the Canada .
the 28 May 1998 , the Justice favour Opposition of the more senior court of the country , Antonio Lamer , thereby that health Justice Claire Assessment happy - Dubé resulted responded by health if to health question of right question by Karl H . Schreiber .
according the Justice favour Opposition , once described completed health study of papers noted , eye by the Department of la Howe of the Canada Reorganizationand action to people authorities Swiss , not Command not remedy favour state the Application of people provision of la Charter .
health letter of asking of offer only report therefore not maintained to the section 8 of la Charter et to people rights of Schreiber .
the Justice Lamer written to the paragraph 24 of dapper decision , et I quote :
health human which refers of people property or of people papers contained a state abroad term the risk that once the or perquisition authorized Port pursuant to people laws of bearer state .
she not may not " time apply wait " to what that confirms not apply place not , if people laws of the state favour issue leave plainly of types measures .
health Justice Assessment Heureux - Dubé , continuing to the behalf of la majority of la court , guardian also of notice that health Charter not apply was not to a government abroad .
Roberta the Canadian , people minister of people authorities Swiss not were therefore not subject to people provisions , section 8 . Ban more , she not apply was not to health letter of asking of offer , because the Canada not ago not risk to health study nor to health perquisition .
Roberta once view dissidente , people judges Frank Iacobucci et Charles D . Gonthier resulted early that the government suisse not guardian not of the everyone then to the Alternative of people provisions of la Charter .
by against , they resulted dealing respected Mr. Schreiber least of people expectations access favour 1910 of life privacy .
thus , people authorities Forces lend owed obtain a mandate before of sent health letter of asking to people authorities Swiss .
health majority ago therefore signed that the section 8 of la Charter apply was contained the case of Schreiber .
accordingly consequential , health study of people papers noted demandée by the Department of la Howe without Authorized pre ago constituency maintained to the right Mr. Schreiber to the Alternative of dapper life privacy .
honourable senators , several of between you resulted Revenue of people reservations ownership to health scope of people provisions of the former bill of bill S - 24 .
certain common that he imposera people provisions of la Charter Canadian of people rights et Freedoms favour 1910 of Alternative of the right to health life privacy to of other country meetings of asking of offer to the dissimilar of investigations from .
i wish to you like immediately .
what bill of bill not ago no scope would .
asset trying of you convince of bearer Into of fact , we must of thanking return to people principles which guident the Application of the section 8 of la Charter meetings of investigations from .
since 1982 , health Court Supreme of the Canada took spécifié contained several the people principles which must define health scope of the section 8 et health manner of the apply order .
Dansl' v. R . Q Schreiber , the Justice Frank Iacobucci opinion that the text of the section 8 marine very little of as Act la scope et the subject of people interests that he VI to protect .
accordingly 1984 , contained the v. Hunterc. SouthamInc. , the Justice Brian Dickson Partnerships person asset the first once the subject of the section 8 . It apply mark of la protection granted to people persons against people intrusions is of the state contained their life privacy .
by against , health scope of what right guardian very by the character reasonable of the standing that ago series human favour 1910 of Alternative of dapper life privacy contained people circumstances of once affair hour .
the Justice Dickson ago explained thus endorsed approach contained Hunter to people pages 159 et 160 , et I quote :
health cash of protection against people and , people perquisitions et people saisies more not VI that once standing reasonable .
endorsed in of the right test by the section 8 , that she authorized Parliament Subcommittee health form if , what is - to - say as once protection against people and , people perquisitions et people saisies " more " , or Subcommittee health form around as the right of apply wait " time " to health protection of la life privacy , Beauchesne that he tangibly together if , contained once situation hour , the right of the public ' t not perhaps importuné by the government must home the not to the right of the government of apply immiscer contained health life privacy of people duty order of supports coloured purposes et , consumer , of ensure the Application of la bill .
accordingly consequential , since the v. Hunter the original of " standing reasonable favour 1910 of life privacy " is the principle structurel allowing of determine if the section 8 apply youth et court people rights of once human contained once situation hour .
Roberta a second time , health Court Supreme ago request contained several decisions the section 8 as rose asset greenhouse of protect people persons , et non of people room or of people things .
what principle the a change important contained the subject of the right to health life privacy .
endorsed interpretation of the section 8 not guardian very nor by health concept of ownership nor by the right being favour 1910 of intrusion .
accordingly 1993 , confirms ago natural health Court Supreme to conclude , contained the v. R . Q Plant , that once human ago series standing reasonable favour 1910 of life privacy relatively to a together of information biographiques of renvoi staff whose care of other persons to his topic .
the Justice John Sopinka , run my asset health majority , took said rejecting to health page 293 of the v. , et I quote :
... ... tienne asset that health protection BNA apply youth , people information before must perhaps of nature personal et confidentielle .
given given people values Subcommittee - military of dignity , of integrity et of self that he being , he is further that the section 8 of la Charter court a together of information biographiques of renvoi staff that people duty palatable , contained once society free et democratic , whatever B.C. et material to health knowledge of the state .
he could consumer apply act of information Refer to cases of people details , Act the start of life et people choice gain of the year .
he seems therefore clear , according health court , that the subject Main of the right to health life privacy is by therefore the greenhouse of once the , of once perquisition or of once study to Act the year .
the instead where endorsed extent is exécutée is without importance .
since the v. Hunter , health Court Supreme ago compromise that the section 8 Partnerships asset greenhouse of protect , before the fact , people rights debates to health life privacy .
he not must not perhaps used asset valider or common , after the fact , people intrusions of the state contained health life privacy of once human .
accordingly what sense , health court ago given to the section 8 once interpretation based Act his principle , of manner to what that he engaged more that once simple ban against people and , people perquisitions or people saisies more .
as the ago explained the Justice Gerard Position Forest favour 1998 contained the v. R . Q Dyment , if the right to health life privacy of the year must perhaps full , we not can we allow of t do points what right that after that he retain been according .
confirms is inherent to health concept of protection against people and , people perquisitions et people saisies more .
honourable senators , as you the know , each year bill once vast importance to dapper life privacy et to people methods of la protect .
the character of la concept of life privacy is becomes that , beginning that lights there ago constituency maintained , lights may rarely health ? contained his entirety .
by therefore , displaced that the section 8 court effective the standing reasonable of once human favour 1910 of Alternative of dapper life privacy , he must produce coloured effects before the 36 of la the , of la perquisition or of la study , et before health information of the information .
without endorsed protection , he not avoided that very little of value favour activist that cash of the right to health life privacy apply he not apply was that asset are , after the fact , of people information francophone of once manner to .
endorsed interpretation of the section 8 ago retired once form paying contained the requirement Current to the Authorized judicial pre that ago levy the Justice Dickson contained the v. Hunter .
Roberta bearer v. , he opinion that the court predicted , contained a Prime time , the dapper decision between the right of la human line to the Alternative of dapper life privacy et 22 of the interest of the state to the regard of the Application of la bill .
by health thereafter , he guardian necessary of determine the payment where endorsed Authorized should perhaps granted by a court .
rejecting Partnerships asset purpose of advise people and et people perquisitions is before that firms not apply produced .
confirms not finest perhaps accomplished that by a system of Authorized pre before health study et non by the ways of once validation the .
accordingly consequential , according the more senior court of the country , the section 8 between Robbie favour state .
thus , the right of the year to the Alternative of dapper life privacy et the interest of the state favour 1910 of Application of la bill are soupesés by the Application of the process of Authorized judicial pre , before the 36 of la the , of la perquisition or of la study am .
honourable senators , people courts resulted also cerné health concept of character process to the sense of the section 8 . In greenhouse , displaced that once the , once perquisition or once study authorized qualifiée of " reasonable " et non not " of to " , she must , according health Court Supreme of the Canada contained the v. Hunter of 1984 :
... ... tienne wheel been préalablement put by once human neutre et impartiale which must act of manner judicial , according of people assess access et the , of little , not Chair not evidence , et perhaps Port of manner reasonable et non to .
the Justice Antonio Lamer ago series , Ambassador 1987 , contained the v. R . Q Collins , three other conditions which must perhaps want to the sense of la bill asset that once the or perquisition Port without mandate not authorized not act " to " to the sense of the section 8 :
... ... tienne she must perhaps put by health bill ; health bill the not must not she - even perhaps to ; et health the not must not wheel been Port of once manner to .
thus , once the , perquisition or study déclarée to declaration very think perhaps , as " reasonable " to the sense of the section 1 of la Charter .
until to now , people courts resulted fact once distinction between people saisies contained the framework of Affairs from et people saisies contained the context of Affairs force .
the criterion of the affair Hunter set previously apply youth rigoureusement to people saisies contained the framework of Affairs from .
health Court Supreme ago also indicated , contained the v. McKinlay by of 1990 , that more the maintained of the right to health life privacy is vast , more people guarantees of the v. Hunter must perhaps want .
Roberta the case Schreiber , people judges Gonthier et Iacobucci resulted expressed once view dissidente , as I the I earlier more earlier , those - side Chair of notice that health study of account problems to the outside of the Canada , without Authorized judicial pre , he the right to health protection of la life privacy .
accordingly the to endorsed conclusion , the Justice Iacobucci apply is supported Act the interpretation wide et Liberal of the section 8 of la Charter that I I explained more earlier .
asset determine if health letter of asking of offer guardian contrary to people provisions of the section 8 , the Justice ago levy people clear Pension contained the v. Plant by the Justice Sopinka .
firms sons asset purpose of determine if once human favour untold Partnerships , relatively to certain information , once standing reasonable favour 1910 of life privacy him success right to health protection of the section 8 . singing health page 293 of bearer v. , he ago written , et I quote :
the review of factors reassess health nature of people information , similar of people Relations between health part divulguant people information et health part favour réclamant health information , the place where they resulted been tax , people conditions contained reasons they resulted been francophone et health state of the Crime bad the subject of the inquiry , allows of pondérer people rights Cultural to health protection of la dignity , of the integrity et of the self of la human et the Application effective of la bill .
several principles arresting perhaps dégagés of endorsed interpretation of the Application of the section 8 . Ban thanking , people authorities relating of the Application of la bill must perhaps sensibles to the right of once human to the Alternative of dapper life privacy , relatively to a together of information biographiques of renvoi staff health regarding .
the existence of once standing reasonable favour 1910 of life privacy déclenche the Application of people guarantees prescribed by the section 8 . " endorsed standing exists et that similar - side is that by once intrusion the by the government , people authorities relating of the Application of la bill are thanks of obtain once Authorized judicial before of act .
existing the framework contextuel individuals by the Justice Sopinka contained the v. Plant , the Justice Iacobucci ago signed that the intimé Partnerships solemn once ceremony standing to the regard of coloured papers noted Swiss .
these months I of people details gain Act la human line , consumer dapper situation financial et of people choice , regarding his start of life .
second , lights finest might people reports which obligation between health per et his one of relationship of trust which , presented the v. Plant , gives instead to once more vast standing favour 1910 of life privacy relatively to people information favour untold .
finally , if people information initiative were investigations accessibility without intrusion or without the giving of a 33 , he there avoided Robbie less of wish that he there retain calling of la life privacy of la human concernée .
accordingly the Canadian , people information resulted owed perhaps francophone by intrusion contained health per suisse et with the giving of a 33 , what which 8 to leadership that the intimé Partnerships once standing reasonable favour 1910 of life privacy relatively to these information .
from more , as the Justice Iacobucci the let to the paragraph 56 of the v. Schreiber , et I quote :
health procedure of perquisition et of study ago summer the by the government of the Canada by health Presented of once asking responsibility to the government of la Switzerland , seen the absence of treaty between people two country .
health asking ago summer introduced contained the framework of once inquiry Canadian which , perhaps - lights speaking , Pius together , to the Canada , to of people Director , to a Quebecer once offence to the Code criminal Heritage .
the right to health life privacy , socially that he ago summer have favour under of la Charter , qualified people persons et non of people room .
the greenhouse Act the year of once perquisition et of la study of papers noted is the same , that health perquisition et health study equipped instead to the Canada or favour Switzerland .
the intimé ago series standing reasonable favour 1910 of life privacy relatively to people information problems , somewhat regardless the place where apply friends people account .
he is everyone to fact reasonable , to my notice , that the intimé apply attende to what that people authorities Forces not qualified status the offer of people authorities Swiss asset obtain coloured papers noted favour Switzerland without obtain once 800 form of Authorized judicial pre to the Canada .
the Justice Partnerships therefore responded by the meeting to health question of Schreiber et he Partnerships recommended of people the to people laws Forces asset involved endorsed imprécision .
what is exactly what that the bill of bill S - 4 VI to off .
from elsewhere , the Justice Wetston of la Court federal et the Justice Linden of la Court of Appeal federal are Energy to people same findings that people judges Prime of la Court Supreme contained the v. Schreiber .
honourable senators , he is clear that each case is particular .
what is why the section 4 of the bill of bill S - 4 introduces that the Justice appropriate , which may hear health asking former parte , must see that she is act to people standards until by health Charter Canadian of people rights et Freedoms .
if becomes is the case , he may tribute once described During that health approach authorized eye , thereby that the require the section 5 of the bill of bill .
honourable senators , before health Presented of people other provisions of my bill of bill , I query deal health question of his Application would .
Roberta the v. Schreiber , the Justice favour Opposition of la Court Supreme ago fact reference to the Application would of la Charter .
asset what do , he ago levy people the Terry et Harrer , which affirmaient plainly that health proposal that health Charter not ago not of Application to the outside of the Canada .
these two Affairs The Act la conduct of authorities American which , upon to people States - States , sons support of people statements of suspects of once manner which , well that act to the Economy Reference and validate , were with with la Charter .
Roberta people two causes , health Court Supreme ago signed that health Charter not finest the people mood tell by of people authorities Foreign contained a country abroad .
endorsed conclusion is that with the section 32 of la Charter , which CRTC the Application of endorsed last " task Parliament et to the government of the Canada " et " to health th et to the government of each province " .
she is also that , as the ago substantial the Justice Beverley McLachlin contained the v. Terry , with the principle of la available International .
according health Justice , he guardian the of apply wait to what that people authorities Foreign iii et observent people laws of the Canada .
honourable senators , contained the case Schreiber , health situation guardian different .
already , the Justice Wetston of la Court federal Partnerships turned the argument following cetera the fact of respond affirmativement to health question raised by the intimé would to apply health Charter extraterritorialement .
he not ago never line favour issue people laws Act the Alternative of the right to health life privacy of la Switzerland nor of the government of what country meetings of la study of people papers noted .
health conduct such favour the Canadian is health dispute et the conveyance of la letter of asking by of people RCMP Travellers .
these RCMP were plainly subject to the right Heritage , there including to health Charter , to the InterProvincial of the Canada Reorganizationand , contained health most of people case , to the outside of the Canada .
they were partisan initiative , to the section 32 of la Charter , Ambassador activist that representatives of the power executive of the " government of the Canada " .
who more is , because that they were Canadians , he not there Partnerships no reason of hold account of la available International .
lights finest therefore apply wait to what that they iii the right Heritage , there including health Constitution .
he not guardian not the of hold of themselves that they the signed .
confirms is particularly true of people RCMP which agissaient to the behalf of the Justice General et which , of fact , mainly wheel of people responsibilities further away of la nature particular of endorsed absent .
i wish to mention that the author of la letter not ago not fact approve the content of la letter by the a of coloured senior .
yet , as I the mentionnais more earlier , endorsed letter opinion plainly that health asking of offer Partnerships asset purpose of pursue once inquiry thing .
she finest give instead to of people Director to the Canada against a citizen Heritage .
Roberta his judgment , the Justice Wetston Partnerships signed to the 944 , et I quote :
... ... tienne if the intimé may perhaps much to the Canada , I not takers not why he not should not wheel right to people benefits accessoires of la Charter
accordingly consequential , he ago signed that the intimé Partnerships once standing reasonable favour 1910 of life privacy .
after wheel Somalia endorsed conclusion et wheel , health nature of people satisfy which sons been saisies , he ago signed that favour under of the section 8 , lights her the Grants of once Authorized pre representations of a Incumbent of duties court hope before that health letter of asking incurred perhaps expédiée .
he is therefore clear that health Charter apply youth of manner general to of types letters of asking .
certain of between you manage tentés of say that health letter of asking not is fact be to a review founded Act the section 8 . You utiliserez probably the example of la procedure that must follow once province Canadian pour status the offer of once another province favour standpoint of the 36 of once the , perquisition or study .
currently , people authorities which arise of types coastal of offer only resulted not to obtain of Authorized judicial pre pursuant to the section 8 before of sent their asking .
he not apply youth not activist that health asking not ago not been received , staffed where he tangibly obtain a mandate During health the , health perquisition or health study .
singing bearer argument , I the rejecting .
Roberta the context Heritage , people authorities which arise health asking know that similar - side Kelleher the subject of a review judicial before the 36 of la the , perquisition or study Proposed .
Roberta the context of the affair Schreiber , to the contrary , lights not ago not benefit health court that people authorities Swiss lend examined the touchstone of la asking of the , of perquisition , or of study introduced by a government abroad .
we not know not non more damned form take a becomes review .
however , lights ago mention that the lights apply do time to what that people authorities Swiss market thereafter to health asking .
as the ago mention the Justice Iacobucci , to the paragraph 57 of the v. Schreiber , et I quote :
he is someone little formaliste of conclude that health procedure the to the Canada asset Examine people coastal of offer representations by once province to once another allows of respond complete to health question raised favour the Canadian .
the Application of once approach formaliste or all is contrary to health jurisprudence Current to health Charter , which recognizes since long that people rights they by what text must perhaps interprétés generously et favour function of the subject subject .
he is more appropriate of apply to health question once approach based Act of people principles .
what outcome is act to the interpretation wide et Liberal allows the by our Court to the section 8 favour standpoint of " tell to the citizen the right of perhaps full against people consequences of the government to coloured expectations access favour 1910 of life privacy " .
no not apply the section 8 to health letter of asking could wheel asset greenhouse of do gave certain " between two chaises " the right of the intimé to the Alternative of dapper life privacy .
i saying confirms because , account held of la situation International favour state here , nothing not we the that the principle of the Authorized judicial pre ago summer lack et , Ambassador consequential , the once of people pierres angulaires of the analysis based Act the section 8 ago summer omise .
... 1610 ...
transport Canadians are protection to the Canada by health Charter Canadian of people rights et Freedoms .
honourable senators , meetings of the debate Act the former respecting bill S - 24 , several of between you , raised health question of people costs substantial linked to the Application of endorsed extent .
i estimated , to health light of people coastal of people years proposed , that what process of Authorized judicial pre declaration perhaps always Auditor et that he not see not of costs substantial asset the government federal .
according people figures provided by the Department of la Howe of the Canada contained health statement Subcommittee oath which Adieu the memory of the Justice General of the Canada contained the affair Schreiber , the Canada took constitutional 79 coastal favour 1992,80 coastal favour 1993 , 137 coastal favour 1994 , 109 coastal favour 1995 et the coastal favour 1996 .
we not we not people figures of people years 1997 et 1998 , but I hope that people representatives of the Department of la Howe able we people provide to time meetings of the study of what bill of bill favour Committee .
i wish to mention that the bill of bill S - 24 not door not maintained to people treaties of offer . which a the Canada to certain States foreign contained the framework of investigations force or from .
the Canada took signed of people treaties of what type avec16 country .
i like now deal health question of people are that the lights wherever to the section 2 of the bill of bill S - 24 .
a force public abroad is once human which voting a mandate legislative , editor or judicial of a state abroad or which protect once function Public to the breast of a state abroad .
what not is not finer which I created endorsed definition .
she apply done of similar portion to the section 2 of la Act Act la corruption of RCMP Public foreign , which ago received health Assent Royal the 10 December 1998 .
the authority outside line by endorsed bill is the Justice General of the Canada , the Justice General of once province et whole human or authority operating , to the Canada , of people investigations provisions to people offences to people laws federal et to their include .
endorsed definition apply done of similar portion contained health Act Act la corruption of RCMP Public foreign having on .
transport offences basis by what bill of bill are Right rose fourth to people laws federal .
what bill of bill is therefore CRTC to people laws et to people regulations MLAs .
health , of the Justice appropriate , according health province .
the Propriety " Justice of peace " 4 to similar line by the section 2 of the Code criminal .
finally , what bill of bill not ago not of greenhouse rétroactif .
accordingly conclusion , honourable senators , the bill of bill S - 4 Kelleher favour hallmark that the section 8 show perhaps done when he may assist to such health allowing of once conduct purport by of people RCMP Travellers , even if health conduct of these RCMP really a country abroad to contribute his assistance .
transport provisions of the bill of bill agreements favour hallmark that the Canada not declaration not impose coloured own standards procédurales to of other States .
by against , he honourable to what that the right to once standing reasonable favour 1910 of life privacy authorized full favour case of the or perquisition eye to the Canada or to the abroad to health asking of RCMP Travellers .
the hon. Dan Hays ( Leader Deputy of the government ) :
honourable senators , the Senator Nolin we ago given a treaty legal very fouillé Act what which engaged , according him , the subject of the bill of bill S - 4 .
i confess say that he me 50 a number time asset well understand what that he ago said , but I chair once issue to him question everyone of thereafter .
accordingly pleased his intervention , he me ago fairly that he Tisserant that health Constitution introduces already once protection rather how .
the Senator avoided - he the ? of lack people reasons which between the Adopted of the bill of bill S - 4 ?
i know well that he ago special a number time et well of people proceedings asset favour happen headed , but , of after coloured comments , the interpretation that people courts resulted hour of the section 8 awarded once protection any full of the right to health life privacy et also once protection against people Director more , of the less if the lights favour Justice of after the affair Schreiber et few other causes .
the Senator Nolin :
health question visit directly the importance .
i hope that we able Refer the bill of bill to a Committee , because what is specific what standpoint that we must And .
what is asset endorsed reason that I I quoted of many causes other by health Court Supreme .

the hon. Senator Austin , P )
the hon. Jack Austin :
honourable senators , the Wednesday 24 November 99 , the hon. Senator two Wilson ago tragic the attention of the Senate Act la freedom person favour China favour report with people pactes international of people UN Voluntary .
coloured observations reposaient Act dapper vast experience of people Affairs program .
our hon. colleague ago acted as modérateur representations of the church united of the Canada .
his intervention Command thereafter to a trip staff that the hon. Senator ago fact favour activist that member of la delegation of the Council Heritage of people Églises , which ago fact a came favour China of the 23 October to the 5 November .
lot of Canadians , here same to the Senate et everywhere to the Canada , run interest of closely to people issues related to people rights of la human , particularly to health manner whose these values , which are criticism according our milled original of people Relations Resources et of la stability social , are want favour China .
what proposals Act la China is inexorable asset health simple reason that health population of what country represents approximately the % of la population World .
transport systems of values et people practices of once if vast regarding of la population of the world are essential to the predatory of once society tragedy peaceful et Progressive to the environment World .
lights ago $ people evidence long which story that health China means promote the Alternative of people rights of la human to the breast of la society community order of whom health creativity of the peoples attempt contained health modernization economic et social of la China .
the report of the Senator Wilson is , to my notice , fair , budget et right favour what which ago truck to health freedom of religion favour China .
accordingly fact , the invitation lancée to the Council Heritage of people Églises asset that he apply His favour China et active health freedom of religion is , Ambassador break , once Propriety of la strongly of la China of commitment once arguments p.m. et a dialogue with to the topic of la freedom of religion as a of people aspects basic of people rights of la human .
as contained whole society , lights must question of people limits to health freedom order of tell that health freedom she - even may perhaps préservée et some .
how find bearer balance is a the the .
a Justice British of the century last ago strokes to find once untold where the défendeur Partnerships crié to the gun contained a Somalia bondé .
he not there Partnerships not of a , but people people which were contained health Room resulted paniqué et lot resulted been accidents favour apply ruant toward people during .
health defence ago allégué the right to health freedom of speak , the right of say not regardless whereupon not regardless where without regard to people consequences .
Roberta his judgment , the Justice ago signed that human not finest apply serve of la freedom of speak asset say attempt or of manner the a mensonge which risk of civil of the wrongly to of other persons of once manner that a man reasonable could include .
the idea that resulted people against of people limits to health freedom of religion is based Act of people values written et of people experiences figures different of people May .
health setting of la China et dapper vulnérabilité to health dissension Internal , to the invasion by of people foreign et to well of other factors engendrent the the of the authority , et of the authority family asset do régner health peace et the order .
transport traditions of responsibility told obligation since of people centuries et , Ambassador fact , acclaimed been the asset ensure health security et health survival of the unity social , that what authorized health family , the village , the s or health province .
the control of the behaviour of people individuals guardian step as importance to health security et to the well - perhaps of the unity .
we reconnaîtrions endorsed practice contained health maxime of John Stewart Mill , which described health political social British as designed " the more orator you asset the more orator number " .
obviously , contained health reality , the autoritarisme apply Adieu often of what alone timeless that is the attitude freedom , endorsed attitude which not includes no extent of protection against the inequity , the immoralité et the non - Enforcement of people practices et of people standards ensure to the Ethics .
well that health China authorized far of perhaps the country the more corrompu of the world , health corruption there is still a problem serious contained once society which springs of attendance health Transition of once economy Justice apply - of the model marxiste to once economy of market between , what is - to - say once economy of market to the sense where we the hear , but once economy still Justice of manner amounts et réglementée to the average of professional quinquennaux et of measures of monitoring of the performance .
apply he not fact nil doubt that the regime political of la China apply done of the autoritarisme , he is also true that people against apply accommodent well of strip Freedoms economic et payroll et that they not resulted never been also well since of people centuries .
the government of la China not responsible may - perhaps not people same Auditor that the government of the Canada asset the , but he keeps really to improve health life of dapper population to the instead of apply talk of involved the group to the power , as confirms apply fact contained of other country .
the Canada apply is committed Act several has with la China , what which she well his commitment programs to the Alternative of people rights of la human contained the sense individualiste where we the hear .
we we of people groups of study fact Act la practice legal et judicial which cancer the responsibilities Act of people values as the burden of la Evidence , the right of remember the silence , the independence of the power judicial et the role of a system of advisors Legal independents .
as people honourable senators the know , Ambassador 1998 , the Parliament of the Canada took implemented Act foot once association legislative issue - China of together with the Congress National of the peoples .
two meetings of parliamentarians resulted strokes instead , once favour China , Ambassador November 1998 , to commentary resulted attended 12 parliamentarians Travellers , there including of people senators , et once another when of people members substantial of the Congress National of the peoples resulted areas Ottawa , Toronto , Winnipeg et Victoria asset opportunity of people hand with of people legislators MLAs et provincial .
Incidence people subjects the , he there ago strokes health practice legislative , the role of our Opposition official , people limits cut to the government contained the process legislative , people rules of procedure et the rest .
transport against are very t to we understand .
from our side , we impotent t to whether how they perçoivent the idea that a debate peaceful not led not to once off social et political , but tax health stability .
transport honourable senators not know may - perhaps not that the comit Joint Canada - China of people rights of la human ago summer created by the Minister of people Foreign Foreign , Lloyd Axworthy , Ambassador April 1997 .
what Committee VI to 15 a dialogue Standing Act people rights of la human between people two country favour Tel everyone particularly the responsibilities Act the Covenant Covenant Covenant to people rights civilians et political et the Covenant Covenant Covenant to people rights economic , Cultural et Cultural , that people two country resulted signés but which not resulted not still been ratifiés by the Congress National of the peoples .

confirms Chair said , he regardless of understand that he exists once wide of issues related to people practices , favour 1910 of rights of la human which attireront our attention contained people months to come .
transport ministers reforms economic favour dissimilar favour China are to the origin of unrest Cultural et political , people million of against sacrifiés Act the the of the programs economic not rose not access to a system of security social recently to 22 that we we to the Canada .
transport levels Cultural et economic research are particularly indignés by health corruption favour China .
the behaviour freedom of people little officials , consumer contained the once - country , is once untold of dissension .
lights how of the agitation political to the Tibet et contained the Xinjiang where is established once majority turque et musulmane .
the government attempt continue of grant health priority to health stability rather that to people reforms structurelles of the system political et legal .
reforming , since 20 years , of huge progress resulted been progress to the chapter of people rights of la human favour China , et I estimated that endorsed trend apply the .
the large of la China to the Organization World of the trade Education a important because .
the Canada Reorganizationand health China resulted signed their agreement Act the large of la China to the major to Toronto , Friday last , the 26 November , to the opportunity of la meeting Annual of quelque250 members of the Canada - China won international .
the major is a system of rules trade toward a process of settlement of people difference .
health China ago plainly different to the principle of la law of the right .
Roberta people years to come , she approfondira dapper understanding et dapper implementation favour practice of what principle .

the hon. Lowell Murray :

transport members of the comit of people Finance national apply objectent to what that his mandate more light authorized dilué of once manner or of once another .
i me to of meet the debate asset allow to condolences colleagues of there participate .
the hon. Dan Hays ( Leader Deputy of the government ) :
honourable senators , I I once issue of the Senator Murray regarding the Into of the Estimates Main of people Estimates before health was .
he me seems that people positions budgétaies of the Department of people Fisheries resulted been them by the comit of people fisheries to the dissimilar of la last sessional .
i me asking if the Senator Murray could explain what change apparent of Position .
i understand that health Ruling ago changed , but why what change of Position between health last sessional et health presented sessional , particularly favour words of what that guardian the comit of people fisheries et of his review of the budget of people Estimates of the Department of people Fisheries ?
the comit wanted hear people evidence of people officials of the Department et of other Act once issue which the the particularly .
from more , I not think not that what is health first once that once part of the budget of people Estimates of a Department authorized country by a Committee particular .
Roberta the another chamber , what is certainly thus that they the asset people Budgets of people Estimates , if I not me understand .
i conclude health manner whose we the the Estimates Supplementary of people Estimates ( A ) , displaced cetera certain appropriation resulted been either to people committees fact favour reason of people practices of the another chamber .
we we out people appropriation rose fourth to people languages Official et to health Library of the Parliament to people committees fact competent .
i apprécierais once response to endorsed issue .
the Senator Murray :
honourable senators , I - of there respond .
i I been chairman of what Committee during a year or two he there ago already a number time , et I I reprinted health Ruling to the dissimilar of endorsed sessional .
health . to the Senate means that lights linguistic the Estimates Main of people Estimates et the Estimates Supplementary of people Estimates to the comit Standing Standing of people Finance national .
since few years , because that of other committees committees resulted left Examine people additional cut asset people departments whose they apply leading , we we decided of discussed people additional cut of these departments setting of the mandate of the comit Standing Standing of people Finance national .
i I before condolences colleagues of endorsed issue to the comit the another day et they apply are who to endorsed practice .
they sons two assess , if I not me understand , et I dispel you say that of people senators expérimentés as people senators Cools , Bolduc et Doody were everyone to fact against endorsed practice .
their first reason , what is that the comit Standing Standing of people Finance national is the comit charged of And people additional cut et he receiving therefore of Refer these additional globalement to our Committee .
confirms said , they law that nothing not prevent a another Committee Standing of obtain the mandate of the Senate of apply focus Act people additional cut asset a Department favour particular .
their Aboriginal basis guardian that , if we elected asset learning that whole study by a another Committee Standing of people additional cut of the Department whose he apply occupies must apply do to the appropriate of the mandate of the comit Standing Standing of people Finance national , Robbie what not citing not possible .
once once my motion agreed , even with several amendments , the comit Standing Standing of the agriculture et of people Forestry , by example , not could not attendance once study of people additional cut of the Department of the concerned .
i think therefore that we not should not accept that a Committee Standing authorized difficult favour whereupon that what authorized of And favour depth people additional cut of a Department favour particular of the odyssey fact that people additional cut resulted been renvoyées globalement to the comit Standing Standing of people Finance national .
confirms could perhaps ports if we - take of people measures asset what which is of approve people additional cut consumer .
as the hon. Senator the knows , what not is not the case .
we advanced report Act people additional cut with our points of standpoint et our recommendations , but we not impotent not food to approve these additional cut favour this .
the Senator Robichaud :
honourable senators , I like explain people reasons of the amendment that I move to the behalf of the chairman of the comit et of people members of the comit of people fisheries .
when the Senator Murray ago proposed the adjournment of the debate Act la motion , I not me am not lot since the Senator Hays the ago fact .
but if I assure , honourable senators , I query you say that the comit not means not create of precedent .
meetings of la first sessional of la last th , the comit of people fisheries Partnerships received a order of referred .
you you rappellerez that once motion Partnerships been back to bearer greenhouse .
what is of elsewhere what that we we fact , et the Minister ago pleasant the comit to three occasions .
he citing contained the interest of the Senate that what Committee apply which Act these é et questionne the Minister contained the purpose of whether how he amounts all these programs favour Application .
Roberta what rapport presented the year last , health seventh recommendation stipulait that people é of the Estimates of the Department of people Fisheries et of people Oceans viability référés to the comit of people fisheries .
what rapport ago summer passed the 16 June to the unanimously by endorsed chamber .
what is therefore Act what rapport et Act endorsed motion , which resulted been name , that apply basic the comit asset continue the study of the budget of people Estimates of the Department of people Fisheries et of people Oceans .
i you awarded that he not is federal contained the intent of the comit of people fisheries of empiéter Act the mandate of a another Committee .
i believe firmly et thing that our role citing rather of you assist , since if you prostituted to necessity people Budgets of all people departments , you not life certainly not the time of do evidence composite of people ministers , strip officials or advisors .
the comit ago one little more the time asset And the budget since he apply notional of a odyssey Department .
we the we fact the year last .
we we impotent well acquittés of endorsed responsibility favour the the Minister .
accordingly body our report thus that once recommendation back to the unanimously , we want everyone simply continue contained health same honourable .
the hon. Anne C . Cools :
honourable senators , I like understand exactly what which apply proceeded here .
more earlier , the Senator Murray ago said that he wanted meet the debate et speak more later .
impotent - we favour full debate or well the Senator Murray apply do he to propose finally the adjournment ?
his Hon. the Speaker :
hon. Senator Cools , we impotent currently before of la motion of amendment of the hon. Senator Robichaud .
the Senator Murray :
honourable senators , I me apprêtais to propose the adjournment of the debate , but early that I I seen that of other senators politics continue , I me am sitting well course asset that the debate incurred apply pursue .
the Senator Cools :
i think therefore that I should add few words to the debate .
he me seems that few issues apply questions to we .
lights could people same favour two argument , health vast et health small .
health vast issue , as the ago if well said the Senator Murray , what is the mandate et people powers of the comit Standing Standing of people Finance national regarding the review of the budget of people Estimates , thereby that the right that ago what Committee the right of receive the entirety of what budget asset his review .
i believe that what that the Senator Robichaud the favour big , what is the right or the power of a Committee of ask a mandate of the Senate asset And certain appropriation which the interest contained the budget of people Estimates .
we do today today to the restore .
the 4 March 99 , by thereafter of the debate held health investment , what is - to - say the 3 March , the Senator Carstairs ago proposed :
that the early Standing Standing of people Finance national authorized authorized to And , sooner of favour do report , people Estimates March contained the Estimates of people Estimates asset the fiscal financial apply ending the 31 March 2000 , to the material of people appropriation 1 , 5 et 10 of Fisheries et Oceans , of the credit 10 of the Parliament et of the credit 25 of the Council private .
the Senator Robichaud wish favour fact réactiver what mandate .
if the lights talk to the debate which ago strokes instead the 3 March , lights broad well that people senators Stewart et Comeau sons solemn presented endorsed asking .
we must address endorsed issue .
singing the clearly , what is the a or the another .
once practice of la chamber des people Commons is subrepticement Act the standpoint of apply favouring to the Senate .
well that I seaway not of session to what that , contained certain case , of people appropriation viability submitted to the review of different committees , I not wish not that confirms make once practice before based et that each once that we impotent before of the budget of people Estimates , that the study of these appropriation authorized Committee to people committees .
confirms Chair said , I want health response of the Senator Comeau .
hence health question that we must by .
asset the role , however , he apply notional of whether if the comit of the Senator Robichaud , the comit Standing apply interesting to Fisheries et Oceans , perhaps perhaps solemn necessary to Examine these appropriation .
we able address the another issue . .
the hon. Sharon Carstairs :
transport he of the comit are limpides .
the odyssey Committee that the rule attendance to And the budget of people Estimates of a Department is the comit Standing Standing of people Finance national .
he not is issue of nil another Committee contained what rule .
however , the rule said that people committees arresting And of people issues favour General .
lights already that , of the standpoint of the government , once study general of people fisheries should obviously englober the study of the budget of people Estimates .
except everyone the Alternative that I you confess , he compensated may - perhaps , endorsed issue et tribute once decision to bearer regard .
confirms risk of we civil of people problems .
we we certainly strokes of people problems , health week last , when we we tried of Refer a bill of bill to two committees have .
we we remains that what not guardian not health right manner of do .
he 50 may - perhaps Chief the rule .
from fact , Your Hon. , you that decide of Refer health question to the comit of people privileges , of the rule et of la procedure , if you préférez not not tribute endorsed decision you - even .
the hon. ë A . Kinsella ( cc Deputy of the Opposition ) :
honourable senators , I am everyone to fact of agreed with people comments of the Senator Carstairs .
i query add that Assessment section of Beauchesne plainly that what is to the comit Standing of people Finance national of And people account declaration et people Finance translated .
regarding the comit Standing of people fisheries , the rule said :
... ... tienne Act order of the Senate , people bills of bill , messages , petitions , interpellations , papers et other Contents regarding people fisheries favour General .
what is proprement the mandate of what Committee .
frankly , what is the role of the comit of people Finance national of And globalement people account Include of the country .
he is everyone continue that of people committees . a interest asset certain departments rose of people programs .
also , he is logical of And the budget of what Department asset whether if people programs favour issue levels or non the purpose of la bill regarding the Department favour issue .
he is whether asset the comit of people fisheries of introduce once motion order of receive the order of the Senate asset proceed to once study , if similar - side right favour same time of people elements Include regarding what Department .
the mandate the by the rule to the comit of people Finance national is complete ports .
accordingly what which motivator people studies the a interest National , he there ago always once issue financial , et he citing important of t not deny to people committees health possibility of the And .
his Hon. the Speaker :
hon. Senator Murray , you prostituted already taken health speak .
prostituted - you the intent of propose your motion et of meet the debate ?
the Senator Murray :
your Hon. , if you intervention prepared to tribute once decision or to say that you . take health question favour advisement , then - we headed .
his Hon. the Speaker :
i query , if you the let , do a regard .
health practice ago summer of Refer the Estimates of people Estimates to certain committees .
i believe that we the we already fact to the dissimilar of endorsed sessional contained the case of people languages Official .
the budget of la Library of the Parliament ago also been out to a Committee .
when I route member of committees , he reach often , if I me recall well , that a Committee which wanted see his mandate continuing asking that lights him whole the budget of people Estimates .
confirms him marine whole day of Examine what that he wanted contained the Department , without another referred of la share of the Senate .
what not is may - perhaps not once right practice , but I know that lights there ago strokes Points by the 9.7 .
transport senators arresting contained what case one what that they want to the topic of the Department .
health practice Current allows only to people committees of Examine people issues which their are renvoyées .
health manner of proceed is once issue that odyssey the Senate may address .
however , he exists a precedent .
the Senator Carstairs :
your Hon. , we could may - perhaps address endorsed issue of la manner significant : we could ask to the Senator Robichaud of discussed dapper motion of amendment ; we could then adopt health motion designed to Refer the budget of people Estimates to the comit of people Finance national ; assure we could ask health permission of revert to people ways , what which c to the Senator Robichaud of propose that the budget of people Estimates of Fisheries et Oceans authorized examined by the comit of people fisheries .
what bad , we not affaiblirions not the mandate of the comit National of people Finance , but we the to the comit of people fisheries the power of And the budget of people Estimates of Fisheries et Oceans .
i not know not if what is headed once manner of apply raises of the dilemma , but what could well favour perhaps once .
the Senator Murray :

transport commitments were essentially that , run he there Partnerships once provision of the comit asset honourable what bill of bill order of take favour consideration people concerns concerns , consumer contained the sector of people care of health , we , of our side , then everyone what that we could , contained health extent of the reasonable , displaced do adopt contained people more , get a bill of bill it order that he incurred perhaps examined by people Members before that they not ajournent health chamber des people Commons asset the medical of ë .
i say now asset confirm bearer commitment .
however , bearer commitment engaged a problem asset health motion .
if I soumettais endorsed motion to a debate et to a vote such , confirms could wheel asset greenhouse of Teleglobe the Adopted of a bill of bill it favour endorsed visit et of body to the commitment that I I taken more earlier .
i query therefore simply say that I not I not the intent of proceed thus .
i try now do few bring Act la question et allowing hear that , when I have complete , a colleague His may - perhaps simply meet the debate .
what is once issue important that I I raised .
what bill of bill combine favour fact two bills of bill says .
i sworn someone share , et I people I may - perhaps always if I dispel people patients , of people - of the Minister of la Howe et of officials of the Department of the CRTC which future that he there Partnerships to the departure two bills of bill which resulted been world favour a odyssey .
i sworn the intent of do disabilities these - to the comte realized .
unfortunately , honourable senators , you , me grounds Act speak , because that Incidence all people the that I I favour document , I not wherever not people statements appointments by Ms will et by people officials of the Department of the CRTC Before the comit of la chamber des people Commons meetings of his review of the bill of bill C - 54 .
Mrs. will ago barrier very plainly that , without whatever will of people much of the cabinet , Mr. government et she sons solemn whom of thanking introduce two bills of bill different , but that favour reason of the calendar Parliamentary , they sons decided of people combiner favour a odyssey .
once . of the behalf of Stéphanie Perrin , of the Department of the CRTC , which ago top Before the comit of la chamber des people Commons , thereby that Before 22 of the Senate he there ago little of time , the ago confirmed without the behind of a doubt .
when people officials of the Department of the CRTC resulted agreements Before the comit Standing , I their I asked health question , but I not I not disposable of response clear .
they politics well course protect strip arrières .
they resulted underlined that the bill of bill Command part the of the framework legislative amend disability the trade the .
they resulted control the fact that people provisions of the bill of bill Act la life privacy submariners task - deserved of the trade the .
firms apply apply to people information gain tax contained the framework of activities trade , that what authorized by seaway the or another .
the fact is that health part 1 engaged a bill of bill favour break .
honourable senators , I I strokes few reservations to the topic of my motion when a number Ian Lawson ago top Before the comit .
what is a lawyer of Vancouver et a an recognized of people issues regarding people information gain .
booted . Lawson ago complete the argument that , constitutionnellement , health part 1 of the bill of bill depends of la part 2 . That not you dérangerai not with endorsed Seneca , of whole manner I not think not the wheel here .
i you asking once once of more of me grounds Act speak .
as you the know , Mr. Tassé , which is a former Subcommittee - Minister of la Howe , is also a constitutionnaliste .
he not is not many of say that the argument Mr. Lawson ago summer réfuté evening Tassé .
he we ago explained of manner examination et . , as to his habit , why the together of the bill of bill et all coloured provisions future a fiscal concern et appropriate of the power of the government federal favour 1910 of trade .
i the to what that I return meetings of la second reading .
he apply notional favour fact of two bills of bill et non of a odyssey .
lights not may not do remedy what bill of bill contained health category of people bills of bill of because that he contains certainly more of a principle .
we assistance Robbie a debate favour second reading , once study favour Committee , a debate favour third reading et we could all not composite home we .
i . that what is once démonstration by the absurd , but I hope that she you allows of understand the risk that questions once ceremony practice .
otherwise said , lights paving to the dealing of people rights of the Parliament favour him soumettant a bill of bill cigarettes a principle plainly set of ceremony hallmark that people parliamentarians qualified discuss of coloured provisions to health light of what principle .
from a standpoint of standpoint practice , to the reading of la second reading , I I expressed health turn that , contained the subsection debate , we accordions lot of attention to health part 1 , based la protection of la life privacy , that we jugeons more the , et not enough to people parties Act the trade the , based la ability of people citizens of information with people departments of the government federal by of people methods on et Act people effects of la Act Act la Evidence to the Canada Act the use of people Communication with by the system judicial .
what are headed of people issues extremely concerns , but the comit of la chamber des people Commons not people ago virtually not the , not more that our milled Committee .
honourable senators , he look of read the third report of the comit Standing Standing of people Affairs payroll , of people Science et of la Technology , tabled more earlier today today , displaced see what which apply is 9.7 .
the report said then : " Assessment Committee not ago not received enough of evidence Act people parties 2 to 5 of the bill of bill asset do of people observations to comments of people provisions that firms issues " .
the comit said dealing that he consideration having a support enough wide to the regard of these parties of the bill of bill .
this well , honourable senators , if , contained few months or few years , he appert that people provisions of people parties 2à 5 , of people problems that human not ago repérés or confidence , Robbie people members of the government et of the Parliament stay the surprised of are , when people people , , Ambassador rétrospective , the the of what bill of bill to the cabinet et during everyone the process legislative .
honourable senators , even if I suggests gave my motion asset people reasons that I I Pension , I wish to what that condolences colleagues include to breaching standpoint people senators of what side - side taking health question to the serious .
we feel that he tangibly do everyone favour our power asset one the government when he presented a bill of bill which is favour fact two bills of bill , as what is the case here , simply asset accommoder those which the people work to the another place .
what are people Members of the Opposition of the another place which lend owed I with effect if confirms Partnerships escaped to the attention of strip colleagues .
but confirms , what is once another history which conclude still once once the importance of the Senate as chamber des Aboriginal review of people decisions of the power executive .
( Act la motion of the Senator Kirby , the debate is adjourned . )

during our deliberations , we we also discussed acrimonieusement of people elements of political which Subcommittee - barristers the bill of bill et we we impotent asked if we apporterions a change basic to the system of the , aspect which Partnerships been defence by several of our and to health chamber .
i I also raised endorsed issue contained health letter that I I recommendations to the Solicitor General .
i not the never to included the deserves of once something to health human to commentary he talk et I confess you gallery , honourable senators , that the work of the comit ago summer address out by health collaboration of the Solicitor General .
nay only ago he responded quickly to our letter , but him - even et coloured officials resulted held account of all our concerns et resulted prepared of people suggestions of amendments Act - the - terrorism .
as we not recall not the time of contribute these changes to the opportunity of la sessional certain , of people officials of the office of the Solicitor General resulted regime Before our Committee health week last order of discuss of new of the bill of bill et of introduce to the comit of people proposals of amendments to the bill of bill which required to coloured concerns .
singing the behalf of the comit , I thank the Solicitor General et coloured officials of the attention that they resulted granted to our concerns et of the assistance that they resulted contribution favour strategy of people improvements to the bill of bill .
the report regarding the bill of bill understand people major amendments core .
corporation , people are of people words " children " et " persons vulnerable " just of the settlement to the body of the text of the bill of bill .
the comit ago lawyer that the term " society " not is more acceptable contained health society of today today .
he not between more contained health practice of using what term contained once extent legislative .
second , the word " , " ago summer said to the section 6 of the bill of bill order that he authorized well clear that only people offences them bound and favour under of the system proposed .
estimates , the Printed of people offences them ago summer withdrawn of the settlement et insérée contained the bill of bill proprement said .
honourable senators , what not is certainly not health first , nor health last once , that we apportons of people improvements to once extent legislative arguments of the another place .
transport changes that your Committee ago consequential to the bill of bill C - 7 resulted Arabian of discussions to once material clear , prior et very to health Act Act the the judicial .
these changes resulted transportation the balance between people objectives of the system of the et the need of protect people children et of other groups vulnerable contained health society .
the hon. A . Raynell Andreychuk :
honourable senators , I supports certainly people observations of the Senator Milne .
i brevity people members of the comit of the excellent work that they resulted fact contained their review of the bill of bill .
i supports people amendments .
i wish however to gallery two subjects of concerns .
transport changes that the lights move of contribute to health Act Act the the judicial favour what which motivator la the future health first intrusion important Act a standpoint where the public . plainly that health the , once once granted , interdisait whole use a of the former the judicial of once human against she .
i me remind that , when I route ardent Scotia , he ago special a number time asset that the public parvienne to understand favour whereupon efficient really health the .
i confess however express some composition regarding the integrity of the process of the .
everyone to the term of the G , the Minister et people officials apply are had very know that endorsed extent the once intrusion contained the system of the et that she the may - perhaps of seven or of she everyone the process of the .
they resulted however takes that the service of police which citing favour absent of the system utiliserait of people mechanisms of control effective .
well that I appointment the more orator Alternative asset people services of police to the Canada , he responsibility to the government of ensure a review fishery et effective of people process of control of la police .
recently , by report to health Act election , lights us ago test that health protection of people information gain citing that .
yet , by the , all people worked of people the of the Manitoba resulted been égarés .
he citing unacceptable that the system of the not first not his integrity .
he citing the of t not do a review review et of t not maintain the system of indicators .
lights not must using 22 - side that asset obtain people casiers court of persons the contained of people offences of nature sexual .
what which me concern , what is that people systems apply détériorent with the time .

the brings means that the lights asking to the sin of the comit when the report Act the bill of bill arranged presented .

accordingly standing health motion , the comit gives to the chairman health permission of introduce the report .

i believe understand that confirms Plan to do favour hallmark that endorsed extent legislative authorized matter of manner their , according people désirs of the Senate .
i the of see to what that the bill of bill authorized examined to health once by the comit of people Banking et by 22 of people Affairs Foreign favour reason of people issues which resulted been raised by people senators relatively to people details of the bill of bill .

the comit ago decided of do report of the bill of bill .
that I side , human not ago seen the bill of report , perhaps - perhaps same not the chairman nor the Vice - chairman .
by concern of people , et by Alternative asset their station , he avoided special to the less that they wrong the report or favour leave health information .
except mistake , what not naturally not the case , et Milne the Senator Hervieux - Payette not ago not been officially put to honour the report .
i asking the of these facts .
the Senator Tkachuk :
nay , confirms not apply is not fact .
the Senator Lynch - Staunton :
second , I not wish not that we we enlisions contained health procedure et I hope that we not the not here a precedent favour the the bill of bill to more of a Committee , but I not takers not how the Speaker may perhaps authorized to Refer of a Committee to a another , to the reading of people Affairs tax , a report which not ago same not been chamber here .
i not takers not the link that health Ruling may do .
that lights me that if I me through , but I supposais , after people two days of debate spent to endorsed issue , that the report citing tabled here et that the Senate déciderait of his fate .
he apply notional of a report purposes to the Senate et non to health Ruling .
i know what that lights established by " order special " .

the will guardian that , displaced go of a place to the another , he him needed perhaps reconfirmé here .
health Ruling ago acted favour our behalf , without explanation nor take .
i I always area that , to the across of the account , what guardian the Senate which décidait how he needed deal people bills of bill et people reports et where they eligible go .
Roberta what case - side , however , even if we want that the report the to the comit of people Affairs Foreign , confirms apply is fact without that the Senate retain his word to say .
the Senate not ago never strokes the opportunity of Examine the report nor of see what that he there Partnerships , .
the Senator Hays :
i like introduce once another well to the topic of the Points to the rule , et more particularly of la concern Parliament by the Senator Lynch - Staunton , to whether if the bill of bill predicted revert here before of perhaps out to the comit of people Affairs Foreign or go to the comit of people Affairs Foreign after that the comit of people Banking favour after nothing with him .
i not I not health Seneca our Before finer , but I believe that health Ruling Partnerships have confirms as supporting say that he the of thanking to the comit of people Banking assure that , once once that the comit of people Banking favour avoided nothing with him , he the to the comit of people Affairs Foreign .
we not we nothing said of more , et he is reasonable of out confirms as supporting say that he the directly to the comit of people Affairs Foreign once once that the comit of people Banking favour avoided nothing with him .
he is also possible of out confirms to health manner of the Senator Lynch - Staunton .
from whole manner , I believe whether that the comit of people Affairs Foreign not ago not began coloured deliberations .
the Senator Lynch - Staunton wishes - he add someone something ownership to his desire that health question authorized now heard to the Senate rather that to the comit of people Affairs Foreign ?
the Senator Tkachuk :

the Senator Lynch - Staunton :
they apply ramènent to a odyssey .
your Hon. ago decided meetings of people Affairs tax - payment where the lights not may nor its the rule nor points a discussed of arguments without favour wheel disposable health permission - of sent to a another Committee a report of Committee which had everyone fair of perhaps tabled .
the rule introduces that to the less a day must apply . between the Tabled of a report et health third reading .
Roberta what case - side , of whole clearly , we not could not mood to health third reading , but we not we same not revival see the report .
i sworn up that , if Your Hon. predicted tribute once decision , you the you fact meetings of the order of the day , refers case we assistance revival Robbie receive once explanation regarding endorsed decision safety .
accordingly Mike , what not is not we which we created endorsed situation .
accordingly Aboriginal instead , the Senator Hervieux - Payette not rose not been officially put by the comit to introduce the report , the report ago he solemn been presented favour right et away form ?
the Senator Kinsella :
honourable senators , what order to the rule includes several elements .
regarding the analysis of the bill of bill by the comit of people Banking , his review section by section et his rapport to the Senate , I I been until to health table asset look the report tabled .
a report apply there scene solemn , but he not report not health Signing of the Senator which the Partnerships presented , what which ago source favour finer once interrogation , to whether damned guardian health process to follow .
the report not ago summer tabled nor by the chairman nor by the Vice - chairman .
singing less that the refer - the of people work of the comit not mentioned that a another Senator ago summer charged of the introduce - et I not the I not Subcommittee people influence - , I not know too if the report ago summer tabled to the Senate favour right et away form or not .
the another issue , which is I , et everyone the world favour ground , exaggerated to the fact that , by order of the Senate , the report must perhaps sent to two committees rather that to a odyssey .
health decision of the do Examine by the comit of people Banking apply expliquait by once series of concerns raised to the reading of la second reading et which concernaient of people issues tax , what which 4 everyone to fact to people skills of the comit of people Banking .
we should And the report of the comit of people Banking before of Refer the bill of bill to the comit of people Affairs Foreign because that he is possible that he there retain a link between people problems of rate that ago long the comit of people Banking et people issues related to people Affairs Foreign - raisers , people issues provisions to people rights of la human which resulted fact part of people points i to the reading of la second reading .
all these issues should perhaps review .
honourable senators , he is possible that we do of manner a little premature .
a report only ago summer tabled .
we not the we not examined .
he exists , to my notice , a link have between the analysis of the report et the analysis of the bill of bill , which citing then out to the comit of people Affairs Foreign .
what is what which me ago natural to me send Act la procedure of la question .
the Senator Hays :
honourable senators , I I already said what that I Kenny of la procedure of the work organization by the comit of people Banking et health question of by the Senator Lynch - Staunton .
however , I wherever the argument of the Senator Kinsella very interesting .
asset what which is of the day - I not sometimes not to built health document Act the account realized of people deliberations of what day - headed - of people members of people two committees resulted five the desire of apply Lavoie Act la question , mostly favour reason of la nature of the bill of bill et of a of people elements of the bill of bill which ago truck to people rights of la human .
we we tried of do favour hallmark that the bill of bill authorized out to two committees successivement .
the comit of people Banking apply citing a Act the Prime bill of bill .
transport words that we we used Robbie were favour retirement of rejecting .
health question is health significant : that fact the Senate or how forward he the produced of the work of the comit ?
my interpretation of people statements to what topic et of all people things that we we appointments until here , based the fact that the report not retain not been signed et Act la question of whether apply he is act to the rule or non that a member of the comit another that the chairman or the Vice - chairman presented a report without once motion . - et I supply that confirms not engaged not a barrier - what is that we want that the bill of bill authorized out to two committees et that people reports of people two committees we service asset perhaps them favour same time .
if confirms is fact , the Senator Kinsella not speaks more instead of apply people .
rétrospectivement , I supply that people suggestions of the hon. Senator were may - perhaps health manner also of proceed - what is - to - say that we not assistance may - perhaps not owed Refer the bill of bill to people two committees the a after the another .
however , since we we risk thus , what which sometimes is exactly what that we - do asset reach to the outcome left , to whether wheel Before we the work of people two committees order of power the Examine .
gold , displaced do confirms , we must wheel people two reports Before we favour same time .
his Hon. the Speaker :

nil amendment et no motion not are tabled to what payment .
he not there ago not of arguments .
what is health situation which , to the hour Current .
however , I try me consider Act la question et I you favour rendrai account early that possible .
orders the orders
transport work of the Senate
the hon. Dan Hays ( Leader Deputy of the government ) :
we we now to people Affairs of the government et I query , to the behalf of people senators of the party came , lending the Prime section asset consideration , authorized the report of the comit Standing Standing of people Affairs payroll , of people Science et of la Technology Convey Act the bill of bill C - 6 .
bill of bill Act la protection of people information gain et people papers on
passage of the report of the comit
the Senate proceeded to the study of the fourth report of the comit Standing Standing of people Affairs payroll , of people Science et of la Technology ( Bill of bill C - 6 , Act designed to facilitate et to promote the trade the favour we people information gain tax , used or information contained some circumstances , Ambassador providing the use of methods on asset information or they of the information et of people financial et favour amend health Act Act la Evidence to the Canada , health Act Act people material regulatory et health Act Act la review of people laws ) , tabled more earlier today today .
perhaps honourable senators , to title of for of the bill of bill C - 6 et of chairman of the comit Standing Standing of people Affairs payroll , of people Science et of la Technology which ago already 3.26 lot of time to the study of the topic treaty contained the bill 28 C - 6 .
condolences hear today today , primarily Act the bill of bill favour General , but also et more particularly Act people amendments to the bill of bill which are proposed contained the report of the comit tabled to the Senate more earlier bearer after - afternoon .
Roberta the context of the economy World , the information is became once marchandise important et believe .
Robbie that previously people governments were duty as people major the et the of information gain , of our days , the sector private leading a role of more favour more important contained what field .
since the s of networks as Internet , health information et health distribution of people information gain is became once source of concerns asset people Canadians which concerned of see their life privacy apply rétrécir to extent that these networks apply extends .
singing the Canada , the government federal et health most of people governments provincial resulted already of people laws which deal of la Donor , of the use et of la information of information gain by the sector private , but odyssey the Quebec ago more once bill Act la protection of people information gain which act the sector private .
some organizations resulted passed of people . Voluntary relatively to health Donor et to the use of people information gain , but the use of these . not is not is et not is not . of a coast to the another .
accordingly 1996 , the government federal apply is committed to develop once bill asset protect people information gain tax by the sector private .
the objective of the government guardian Robbie of some before the beginning of the year 2000 .
the bill of bill C - 6 Her of bearer commitment .
a bill of bill which objective to protect people information gain must necessarily hold account of the right of once human of whether et of accept that of people information to his topic manage tax , used or have to some purposes .
the bill of bill C - 6 VI the balance between of people objectives conflictuels , to whether , of once share , what right of once human of 1986 to provide of people information et of understand why of people information are tax et how they manage used et , of another share , health need of ensure a functioning without et effective of the economy .
honourable senators , to the material of the odyssey amendment proposed contained the report of the comit , I dispel you ensure that the study of the bill of bill C - 6 favour Committee ago worker that he apply notional of once extent legislative remarkable .
the government ago product a real Opposition - of implementation Act the trade the .
the bill of bill Pierre what difficult balance between the world of people Affairs et people interests of people consumers .
these , honourable senators , I not I never seen a bill of bill that people businesses that people groups of consumers are everyone tree impatients of see passed .
all people representatives of businesses , of consumers , of firmes technological , of companies of EI , of Banking , et same of assessment of the credit , which resulted agreements Before the comit resulted presence the Adopted quick of the bill of bill .
all these stakeholders the that he represents a together fair et reasonable of practices of information .
accordingly greenhouse , of people witnesses of all people sectors of the economy Canadian , to the material of the sector of la health , acclaimed big of people as as " balance do " , " outcome of years et of months of negotiating " , " very good consensus " , et cetera , displaced describe what bill of bill et ask his Adopted with can .
transport witnesses which resulted passed what standpoint of standpoint understood non only of people representatives of the sector of people businesses , but also , by example , of people follow of people rights civilians et of people expert favour protection of people information gain .
by therefore , honourable senators , if what bill of bill is also good that I just of the say , why the comit there ago he proposed a amendment ?
what is to endorsed issue that I believe duty leaders health distraught part of condolences observations .
what is because that , Ambassador despite of the support whether of people businesses et of people consumers , a sector very important apply welcome to the unanimously to his Adopted , displaced the deal .
reforming , a sector , Auschwitz of la health , is everyone tree unanimous contained his Opposition to the bill of bill .
he is clear that the together of the sector of la health not Command not part of the admirable consensus whose I I spoke he there ago one deal .
accordingly greenhouse , even to the breast of what sector , he not there ago correct nil consensus Act what that should perhaps health right solution , Ambassador what sense that he not apply is not presented as a group homogène which réclamait a together precise of amendments .
he ago precondition all kind of amendments .
let - finer of you give few examples asset upon health situation .
certain witnesses resulted recommended that people information Act la health viability complete society of the bill of bill .
from other , as people door - speaking of the Association medical Canadian et of the Association to Canadian , yes that the bill of bill not protégeait not enough people information gain Act la health .
from other apply the if people provisions provisions to the consent were life since firms not parlaient not specific of consentements process et real .
all people members of the sector of la health which resulted agreements Before the comit sons of people doubts ownership to health scope et to the Application of the bill of bill .
transport concerns that I I representations schématiquement , honourable senators , urban of circles very various , by example of people doctors , of people are , of people pharmaciens , of people nurses , of people hospitals , of people Federal Carstairs , people circles of la research medical , people departments provincial of la Health , people responsible of the accreditation of people services of health , et cetera .
singing say true , honourable senators , nil of people groups of the considerable of la health which resulted regime Before the comit or him resulted fact reach a memory not guardian house to the Adopted of the bill of bill contained dapper form Current .
the comit ago also been the by the Richard of many representatives of the sector of la health which resulted said not not wheel played a role serious contained people Consultations which resulted standing the Tabled of the bill of bill .
certain of between themselves resulted same Syd to the comit that they sons release with people responsible Public he not there ago better that eight or nine months , et that they apply were fact respond that he not there Partnerships not instead of apply people of what bill of bill because that he report favour fact Act the trade the et non Act the sector of la health .
by therefore , honourable senators , the consensus if admirable that the Minister ago succeeded to taken favour very little of time contained the rest of the economy , authorized approximately 18 months , not the not the sector of la health because that the bill of bill predicted bringing Act the trade the .
he apply the that lights not ago not then Act the encourage to include the sector of la health Incidence those which eligible play a role importance contained people negotiations .
from many services of health are to health absent of the state , but people persons et people organizations which people fournissent order arresting article to the sector private , to the sector public or still to the sector of the . .
he exists therefore of people links lot more enhance between sector public et sector private that what not is the case contained someone another field of the economy Canadian .
gold , honourable senators , the sector of people care of health the lot to take the bill of bill becomes that he is .
accordingly fact , the Minister of the CRTC ago supported implicitement what the when he ago top Before the comit of people Affairs payroll , Thursday last , to comments of the Application of the bill of bill C - 6 to the information sur la health et ago said that , contained people three years following the coming favour effect of the bill of bill , his impact Act the sector of people care of health citing very .
he ago contrary that endorsed impact citing dangerous very that she not through federal of Teleglobe the Application of what bill of bill asset Chief his impact Act the sector of people care of health .
honourable senators , people members of the comit resulted including people arguments of the Minister , acclaimed including people facts Act compete they were good , et favour are yet Energy to once conclusion totally different .
the comit continues of fear that what bill of bill of trade the not retain of people effects high obscurs et the ; more important still , the comit explain mostly whether health nature likely of these effects high .
accordingly greenhouse , the impact likely of the bill of bill Act the sector of people care of health is far of perhaps clear .
apply he is true , as the ago fact points the Minister , that the bill of bill not speaks of people repercussions that Act once today part of the sector of people care of health contained people three creation years following dapper of , he is therefore possible , during a number time , of Chief people effects that he speaks Act people information particularly information et gain Act la health of people people , without companies coloured repercussions Act the vast sector trading which rest .
since , with bearer amendment , the bill of bill not speaks of people repercussions Act the sector public ' people care of health that three years after his coming favour effect , we way to the government et to people parties involved health possibility of develop of people rules et of people regulations which garantiront to people Canadians that people information gain Act their health manage treaties ask by people stakeholders of the considerable of la health .
honourable senators , account held of endorsed possibility et of the fact that all people other sectors of the economy Canadian were given to hoped that the bill of bill authorized passed quickly , the comit apply is Robbie asked apply he there Partnerships once manner of give satisfaction to those which souhaitaient once Adopted quick of the bill of bill , everything favour interesting to people reservations concerns by the sector of people care of health .
the comit ago tie to the unanimously the idea of material fully to the Application of the bill of bill Act la protection of people information gain the sector of people care of health , as the resulted proposed certain witnesses .
he ago however found appropriate of include once colleague period order of determine apply he is possible of happen to a consensus Act people changes to contribute to the bill of bill asset tribute coloured repercussions Act the sector of people care of health taken et field .
Thursday last , we we heard different witnesses representative the sector of people care of health .
from whole clearly , they apply are concertés before of come evidence , because they resulted all proposed exactly the same amendment ; they resulted all proposed of wait five years before of a the sector of people care of health to people provisions of the bill of bill .
account held of the importance Capital of people information gain favour 1910 of health et of la need that these months viability protection by health bill Act la protection of people information gain , the comit estimated that five years , what is well too term .
we we other rather asset a respond of a year after health of , or of two years to rely of the day where the bill of bill receives health Assent Royal .
the Minister ago already said that health bill not arranged the that a year after wheel received health Assent Royal , of hallmark that our proposal is that the respond authorized of two years after health Assent Royal or of a year after health of .
singing our notice , a respond of two years should perhaps total asset allow to people parties interested of the sector of la health et to people officials of people departments of la Health et of the CRTC of favour happen to a consensus Act people changes to contribute to the bill of bill asset that he the effective Act the sector of la health et asset dispel once right part of the uncertainty which the let now .
we feel also , honourable senators , that health structure of our amendment presented a important advantage Act the plan of la negotiating .
accordingly greenhouse , we allow , contained bearer amendment , that if , both years after health Assent Royal or a year after health of , nil consensus not apply is the et that no Modified not retain been introduced , the bill of bill becomes that wording it favour effect contained the sector of la health .
by therefore , honourable senators , we feel that endorsed extent increase modérément the sector of la health to favour happen to a consensus order of avoid all people problems whose he said apply people .
the fact of impose once date knew to commentary the bill of bill will favour effect to less that a consensus not authorized balance citing a average very effective .
i confess say , honourable senators , that the comit ago fact a work remarkable favour a very term laps of time .
we we strokes lot of hours of hearings .
we we entendu25 witnesses , what which is to little closely health half of people people which sons asked to the departure to perhaps hour .
Roberta people months days of people hearings , of other persons apply are representations favour completed to perhaps other .
he is therefore become obviously asset the comit that , if we take find once solution acceptable to the problem of the sector of la health favour take the bill of bill to the Senate until to what that once solution négociée incurred perhaps the , he compensated lot of time .
if we recall chosen endorsed seaway , the bill of bill not become not bill et he not apply would not to all people other sectors of the economy Canadian which the chance .
by therefore , we we found that health something logical to do guardian of t not Teleglobe the Application of la bill to all people sectors of the economy which chance that the bill of bill authorized passed , but of favour Teleglobe the Application to a odyssey sector et during a year only after health of .
what are headed , honourable senators , people legal of the report .
if you want once analysis more language of people evidence hour by the comit , which , to my notice , submariners contained the sense of people findings of the comit I you whole to health second part of the report of the comit , which ago summer tabled to the Senate yesterday .
i urges people honourable senators to read endorsed part of the report .
i the indicated , we meet that a postponement of a year after health of , authorized two years after health Assent Royal , allow health held of negotiations very pointues between people departments of la Health et of the CRTC et the sector of la health .
accordingly ending , honourable senators , I like also speak of la Act Act la protection of people information gain .
he ago underlined that he there Partnerships of people the know between the bill 28 C - 6 et health Act Act la protection of people information gain .
by example , according health Act Act la protection of people information gain , lights may apply body to health Court federal sideshow contained people case where the access to of people worked ago summer refused .
transport complaints regarding health Donor , the use or health communication of information by once institution self not arresting do the subject of a referred Before health Court federal .
yet , to people words of the bill of bill C - 6 , people complaints regarding health Donor , the use or health communication of information by the sector private arresting do the subject of a Appeal Before health Court federal .
honourable senators , Ambassador activist that parliamentarians , he paving without say that we must impose to people institutions Change et to people institutions corporations people same requirements favour 1910 of protection of la life privacy .
the comit favour is ratify to health conclusion that , if the bill of bill C - 6 , favour effect , he compensated implement to day health Act Act la protection of people information gain asset that people institutions Change et people institutions corporations viability to the less the to people same requirements favour 1910 of protection of people information gain .
always Act endorsed issue , honourable senators , if the bill of bill was a program of lives of the public by the Commissioner to health protection of la life privacy et if the respecting bill C - 6 thing of new responsibilities et that reduced the mandate of the the to health protection of la life privacy , he paving of break , still once once , that once part , of the report of the comit recommends of established of people resources further to the the to health protection of la life privacy asset that he apply the of his mandate continuing .
accordingly ending , honourable senators , I observance that the comit ago tried of establish a balance becomes that the Application of what bill of bill to health vast majority of the economy Canadian - or to the more orator number of sectors economic - ending limited without decision et that , displaced once period very colleague , let a year after health of of the bill of bill , endorsed Application not toucherait not the sector of people care of health contained the hope that , contained people 24 months subséquents , we could happen to once solution négociée regarding what bill of bill .
hence , honourable senators , contained breaching context apply i the bill of bill .
the amendment ago summer passed to the unanimously to the comit .
nil Senator not ago constitutional of view dissidente regarding the amendment proposed .
by therefore , honourable senators , I you look to adopt the report of the comit .
the hon. Donald H . Oliver :
the hon. Senator Senator - he of respond to once issue ?
the Senator Kirby :
yes .
the Senator Oliver :
you prostituted said everyone to the term of your intervention that he not there Partnerships that a sector which not Command not the subject of a consensus et that what guardian the sector of people care of health .
you prostituted also Syd that once part of la response résidait contained the fact that he is together as a bill of bill Act the trade the et non Act people care of health .
that is - what which is informed of pursuing et damned lesson may learn the Senate of what process ?
how may - lights apply ensure that confirms not apply . not ?
we a headed a bill of bill et we the and to the another chamber .
that is - what which is informed of pursuing during what process ?
the Senator Kirby :
i not dispel that of of people assumptions Act confirms .
your issue is good .
you flavour that we we impotent the Act la seams of the bill of bill et Act la reaction that she C home people people , Chair given the little of time whose we the et our desire of finishing quickly our study .
what that I me about to say is Somalia of various tax of evidence rather that of once conclusion language .
corporation , the bill of bill ago everyone of thanking been a bill of bill Act the trade the et Act la protection of people information gain contained the trade the .
when lights think to the trade the , lights not think not immediately to the sector of people care of health to the Canada , because he is subventionné by the state .
what is normally what that the lights think .
if we - provide all people sectors linked to the trade the , even if we Pension to the sector of people care of health , health most of between we the écarteraient .
lights may therefore understand that he not retain not been to the Prime plan of people negotiations the .
health described something which . the bill of bill is that he apply youth to people activities trade of the sector private .
from new , when lights think to people activities trade , lights not is not am to think the to the sector of people care of health .
however , when lights is the of ponder to health question , lights speaks conscience of the fact that of people Federal et other resulted of people activities trade .
nevertheless , when health question of people activities trade is raised asset health first once , lights not think not immediately that he there ago one orator number of corporations trade contained the sector of people care of health .
finally , he there ago one factor contained the field of la health which not exists nowhere share elsewhere : one orator number of institutions Public et Woodlot carriers of people services identiques .
transport Federal carriers a example patent .
he there ago also of people services of praxithérapie et of people services of diagnosed .
we not the not that they are different , because what are people same people which pay health His .
also , I believe that confirms ago summer a new of right faith .
he receiving may - perhaps of note that when what bill of bill ago summer examined by the comit of the industry of la chamber des people Commons - et asset show the interest that what bill of bill ago source , I wish to you gallery that he there ago strokes 18 days of hearings headed - dealt - lights ago 3.26 very little of time to health health because people witnesses not sons not asked to subpoenas Before the comit .
lights ago lot more spoke of people care of health Before the comit Standing that Before the comit of la chamber , what which not is favour nothing once critic of the comit of la chamber .
human contained the sector of la health not Partnerships including that what bill of bill avoided of important repercussions contained what sector .
accordingly part , Robbie that lights between contained of new areas trading as the trade the et the rest , people so during between people various sectors of the economy apply effondrent .
singing the future , when we report of people bills of bill disability these new food of systems of communication , what that the trade the is favour fact , we vote ensure to adopt of people measures it et to is all people t .
i not think not that which that what authorized should perhaps to remiss , because he not there ago not of the the .
honourable senators , once series of things apply are some here by the .
what is a excellent bill of bill , but the comit think that he is , apply address to what problem .
by against , if lights mind the bill of bill without amendment , lights thing a bill of bill to a sector important of la society Canadian to the dealing of people wish of all people organizations of la society .
we feel that what not is probably not once right manner of establish health political Public .
the Senator Oliver :
confirms me really to my described issue .
a number number of witnesses of the sector of la health which resulted regime resulted Syd that once solution possible asset themselves constitutional to annexer their criminal becomes that prepared or it .
sir - you we explain why the comit not ago not accepted these local arguments of a number number of witnesses of the field medical ?
the Senator Kirby :
yes .
what is once right issue .
the better example is 22 of the Association medical Canadian , which Partnerships said that we should integrate his criminal to the bill of bill .
the problem , what is that you not agree the do quickly .
why clerical the criminal of the Association medical Canadian et non not 22 of the Association of people are or of people pharmaciens ?
composite ago dime criminal of protection of people information gain .
early the deal where you posez endorsed issue , you embarquez contained the process examination of negotiations et of predatory of a consensus which is required , as I the I said .
the comit ago signed that , well that lights incurred act of la hallmark , confirms take obviously several months .
we we therefore me the Adopted of the bill of bill relatively to people sectors of the economy where everyone is contained the order et of leaders people 24 months core to the predatory of a consensus .
he is true that several of people agencies professionals et institutionnels resulted earlier that they facilities already a criminal of protection of people information gain , of hallmark that people members of the comit envisageaient with optimism health possibility that the lights incurred develop , to the dissimilar of endorsed period of 24 months , to printed of these various . , a together of - which like consensus et which apply House to the sector of people care of health .
singing our notice , he guardian comes of act of la hallmark rather that of take the criminal of the a of people groups , assure of the adopt et of the apply to all .
the hon. Lowell Murray :
honourable senators , I reprends headed where people senators Oliver et Kirby resulted agreement .
corporation , people people of the sector of la health we resulted favour General said that they not resulted not participated to the developing of the criminal of the Association Canadian of normalisation Act cetera the bill of bill is founded .
second , as the Senator Kirby the ago mention , certain of between themselves serious that a member of the government their ago guide the that the bill of bill not apply would not to the sector of people care of health .
accordingly reality , he seems that he not apply youth not to of ministers pans of the sector of la health , authorized people the " non trading " , there including to people links professionals between the men et the doctor , the men et the hospital , et cetera .
whereupon that he favour authorized , when you cherchez to the people activities trade of people activities non trade contained the sector of la health , he seat very difficult of determine where et how . the bill of bill .
these two factors resulted been strong substantial favour what which motivator the sector of la health .
ownership to health possibility of Issuance the criminal of an of people doctors et of people are or of someone another profession favour Printed to the bill of bill , I confess say that I I been address tried of the propose .
singing health reading of these . , he is clear that they alone a together of standards rather higher to the criminal the of a consensus of the Association Canadian of normalisation .
i believe however that , even if we recall decided of the do , we we move investment favour land constitutional very little course .
lights Saturday guide hear that we take some et potential to the regard of people Professional , a field which provincial contained health most of people case of la jurisdiction alone of people provinces .
honourable senators , he is groups asset finer of try of add whereupon that what authorized to what that we we heard of la share of the chairman of the comit Subcommittee form of explanation , of context or of session asset the amendment whose we impotent before .
his intervention to bearer regard ago summer full et specific , et I me to of say that I am fully of agreed with everyone what that he ago said .
i hope that the amendment hope assist the approval of the Senate et finally of the government et of la chamber des people Commons .
i opportunity however of the opportunity asset thanking the chairman of the comit of we wheel understand to good Port et with success , until to subsection , everything to the term of a review very special of once extent legislative very important to commentary we we 3.26 once were of hours .
i the thank of we wheel farmers to once solution ; well that she not retain may - perhaps not been health solution . of all those which resulted agreements Before the comit nor same of all people members of the comit , she represents dealing a compromise hon. et practice which , I the indicated , Finlay assist the approval of the Senate et of the government .
health job not ago not been easy asset him , et we all , members of the comit , apprécions dapper patience et his exercise .
i the indicated , I not already nothing to the explanation et to the context that he we ago useful regarding the sector of la health .
i wish however to gallery a another aspect of the bill of bill .
what not is not a standpoint Act cetera the comit apply is speech , but he apply notional of once something which me turn lot .
i you health observance sideshow asset you ask of there ponder what night because I I the intent of there revert to the reading of la third reading order of propose everyone probably a amendment .
honourable senators , according once provision of what bill of bill , of people information very gain tax by of people businesses trade contained the framework of strip activities arresting perhaps information 20 years after the Late of people persons favour issue .
singing my notice , endorsed provision is indéfendable et , if I the dispel , I what propose that she authorized per of the bill of bill to the payment of dapper third reading .
i I asked to various witnesses which resulted regime Before the comit - of the Minister to the Commissioner to health protection of la life privacy , Ambassador Mike by all kind of follow of people rights to health protection of people information gain - of justify the well - founded of endorsed provision , et nil of themselves not ago revival the do .
health Gotcha explanation that they resulted revival give , what is that he exists once provision powers contained health Act Act la protection of people information gain , once provision which forward of people information tax by the government federal et coloured agencies .
he may having someone reason floor , contained health political self , displaced include once ceremony provision favour what which ago truck to people information tax by the government - I the know et I like there revert more later - , but I not dispel conceive nil basis Haidasz of information , to someone payment that what authorized , of people information gain Act of people cartes of credit , based once get , based of people account problems or Act a file of pharmacie , which are tax by of people organizations trade to of people purposes trade .
from whole clearly , the bill of bill forward already of la possibility of prevent Act a Crime , of ensure health security national et thus of thereafter .
lights us ago said : " Ces information not arresting not perhaps information .
he tangibly wheel once reason of the do .
perhaps - perhaps the Commissioner to health protection of la life privacy could - he intervene to a number payment . "
everyone confirms is very subjectif , mostly 20 years after the Late of people persons favour issue .
a lawyer which ago top Before we , Mr. Lawson , whose I I spoke yesterday , et which is , as health most of people people which resulted regime Before we , a causes veteran of the bill of bill , took said that , according him , the right to health protection of la life privacy not should apply apply that to people persons , .
i am everyone to fact against endorsed idea et I am of notice that we should health it .
i not wish not the Act the speech that I bring probably tomorrow after - afternoon , but I like you favour give a before - taste .
i wish that you , that I you saisirai of endorsed provision et I look people colleagues to me provide once concern language , run they the arresting .
wishes , I you inviterai to you join to finer asset modify the bill of bill to the reading of la third reading of manner to limit endorsed provision .
honourable senators , as I the I earlier to health second reading , Ambassador big , what is a bill of bill which support et deserves of benefit of the support of all to health chamber et everywhere to the country Incidence those which are to the aware .
what is that he étendra health protection of la Act Act la protection of people information gain to the whose salmon of information gain that people businesses trade . Act composite of we contained the framework of strip financial .
singing the material of la provision whose I I spoke everyone to the hour , everything allows of grounds that these measures of protection are base et effective .
as the Senator Kirby we the ago said , what bill of bill is the consultation of a consensus extraordinary refers are Energy the sector private , the government federal , people various groups of defence of la protection of la life privacy et people groups of defence of people Freedoms basic .
the government may to fair title perhaps proud of wheel word supports what consensus .
asset all those et all Right which common , et I think that health most of between we favour are , that health protection of la life privacy fact part part of la dignity et of the self Resources et that what is a right timeless , he apply notional of once reading distraught .
i believe that favour standing the bill of bill we close reduced amendments people measures of protection et the framework legal of people rights humans favour what country .
all people Canadians not are may - perhaps not to the aware of what that we impotent favour emerging of debate et of do today today , but I think that what bill of bill amended arranged the a of people accomplissements figures of endorsed th or of people recent times .
the hon. Sharon Carstairs :
honourable senators , I thank the Senator Murray et the Senator Kirby asset the excellent work that they resulted fact favour what which motivator what bill of bill .
the Senator Murray not is not normally member of the comit but , as he the ago said more earlier contained his intervention , what is once extent legislative to commentary he apply is always interested .
well that favour principle confirms not authorized not expected contained the rule of the Senate of the Canada , our Committee steering guardian seven of four members .
the Senator LeBreton , the Senator Kirby et finer - even we get the Senator Murray to our discussions favour reason of the interest deep that he door to endorsed extent legislative .
as the Senator Kirby et the Senator Murray , I supports favour General the bill of bill C - 6 .
i supports also the amendment without no contingency .
confirms intéressera may - perhaps the Senator Murray et the Senator Kirby of whether that lights springs fair of me thoughts once letter arguments of the Association to Canadian .
the association not like not particularly bearer amendment .
she wanted that we the contained once another leadership .
coloured representatives we resulted asked to health meeting of the comit of strengthen health bill .
they resulted said that the Association to Canadian Partnerships always been favour favour of the Adopted of the bill of bill C - 6 , the of people amendments which assureraient once more vast protection of people information gain that people provisions of the criminal CSA , Ambassador regarding the consent his of the interested .
i am of agreed with themselves .
i souhaiterais finer also strengthen endorsed protection .
the impasse Before commentary apply guardian found the comit guardian result to health question of the consent .
if we recall implemented of side all people other aspects of the bill of bill asset not deal that of the exercise asset health health originators of once protection ill of la life privacy , I not think not , honourable senators , that we assistance revival adopt health lower provision of what bill of bill before may - perhaps six months .
our amendment Partnerships asset subject of legislative the Adopted et the Application of people sections dealing of the trade the favour outside of the framework of la health .
between - time , we could take the time of ponder , non not necessarily to the Senate , but contained the framework of audiences with the sector of la health , the sector of the industry , people ministers of la Health et of the CRTC et strip the parties .
all these parties that lend revival implement to the standpoint of people changes which lend Arabian to what text of respond to people needs et objectives of the industry of people care of health .
honourable senators , endorsed issue apply is fund to the centre of condolences concerns asset health length of our study of the bill of bill .
certain witnesses not resulted treaty that of people sections regarding the trade the .
they including the industry of the Phenomenon , the ordinatique favour someone hallmark , the sector of people Banking , the sector of the in , et they were all the to the bill of bill , not formulant that of people objections i regarding dapper seams .
accordingly fact , they there the with enthusiasm .
they apply are the of the how monumental that Partnerships been the fact of wheel rallié the consensus of all these groups to the topic of the criminal of la CSA .
transport members of the comit not resulted not ? to noted that he not there Partnerships not consensus contained people circles Carstairs .
transport doctors et people are resulted address that strip own . were senior to the model of la CSA .
transport pharmaciens , displaced their share , et those which . of the information sur people services of health , once exemption total .
asset my share , I not route not the to health their grant .
apply they want using or sell condolences information gain , I should wheel my word to say Act people information which their tomberont between people hands .
fact more important still , we not we never discussed of two issues cruciales , authorized people are of people as " Business commercial " et " consent his " .
i I been of of hear the Commissioner to health protection of people information gain plan that all people consentements are of people consentements the .
despite everyone the Alternative that I confess to party Phillips , I not am not of bearer notice .
if lights me most contained once Room of emergency where I me wanted Before five doctors et 16 other members of the staff who me saying that I I need of some interventions medical of emergency , I try sign not regardless whereupon .
i hope that those which able wheel to apply deal to my hearts signeront not regardless whereupon asset that I right people care necessary .
but what not is not a consent his .
i not known not people effects high of the treatment préconisé et , to the investigate , I not me favour concern not get .
health question of people are not ago not been plainly matter , Ambassador what which motivator people information gain favour 1910 of health .
i supports therefore without reservations health recommendation of the comit supporting that we prévoyions a respond asset And certain of these problems .
honourable senators , he tangibly acculer people parties favour untold to the foot of the this .
transport members of the comit resulted heard of people evidence , et which sèment health mind .
he tangibly of the time asset define of people rules long provision people information gain favour 1910 of health after wheel strokes of people trade with all those which . or materials these information .
he not look not of Teleglobe of two years the coming favour effect of the bill of bill asset 50 our objective .
transport Canadians deserve that of people lines presence long entire the use of their file medical et provisions consumer their consent his to bearer greenhouse .
transport Canadians not chance not , displaced health most , that their file medical authorized full to the standpoint that he not incurred not serve to of people researching designed to find a " to once disease or to once affection .
if endorsed information is necessary asset . of new Veterinary , he 50 find Robbie a balance .
a becomes balance not exists not contained what bill of bill .
we can only expect that bearer balance arranged found thanks to our reflection et to bearer amendment .
the hon. Jerahmiel S . Grafstein :
honourable senators , I I once colleague issue to question .
i favour I you the Senator Carstairs more earlier today today .
i not I not examined the bill of bill also step that I chair owed the do et I not I not taken knowledge of people evidence .
however , Ambassador pleased people argumentations , I me asking if the lights not should not wheel asset political Public of be the identity of la human whose the information is the of the content of endorsed information .
by example , the Princess the Hospital , to Toronto , immunities each year 60 40,000 women consequences of the Cancer of the breast .
singing side , health worked of the Cancer of the breast of the Mount Sinai Hospital receives 25 40,000 women by year .
what is thus that contained what périmètre of someone 92 metres , namely 40,000 mandate are soignées each year asset the Cancer of the breast .
the information to what topic is currently recueillie et colligée representations of people researchers et diagnosticiens et regroupée favour of people points centraux .
from huge progress resulted been progress , to everyone the less , contained the treatment of the Cancer of the breast .
confirms Chair said , if the lights means blood a treatment , the content of the information is indissociable of people progress tell by the sector of la research .
if endorsed information not guardian not recueillie , colligée et triée , health fight against endorsed terrible illness that is the Cancer of the breast not progresserait not .
the same the worth also asset the or or whole disease which we , .
i not I not too including if the comit or the amendment keeps account of endorsed issue research .
accordingly reality , atténue lights the problem or , lights health job of people researchers which must wheel access to endorsed information asset the up of la research ?
singing the instead of improve health situation , not impotent - we not favour emerging of tribute vaine health research ?
the Senator Carstairs :
honourable senators , you be may - perhaps t of learn that we we heard people evidence of two groups of researchers whose people hand divergent Act endorsed issue .
a group is of notice that he tangibly establish more of measures of control asset protect health life privacy of people persons which fournissent the information .
the another group estimated that health research of endorsed nature not must participate not perhaps be to people provisions of the bill of bill .
he believes that these measures of control provoqueraient the upon with that the hon. Senator springs of making relatively to the power of produce the information to necessary .
the hon. Senator ago explained our dilemma .
we we heard of people purposes very serious of witnesses which we resulted said that what bill of bill one health Donor of data of research as similar that ago step the hon. Senator .
from other resulted Agriculture that he not , not to health Donor .
from endorsed manner , we not porterons not L to health research .
our researchers resulted fact of the good work to bearer regard contained the 9.7 .
from such regulation that anyone not means not participate to a bill of research should wheel the right of agree that his work be to this bill .
he tangibly therefore blood of people protocoles .
frankly , however , he we tangibly of the time asset the do .
the Senator Grafstein :
honourable senators , if what bill of bill gives instead to a dilemma , why apply per ?
why we feel - we forced of And what bill of bill if certain of coloured supporters who of serious doubts to his regard ?
the Senator Carstairs :
the problem with what bill of bill , Senator Grafstein , what is that , of manner general , human - et certainly human to health chamber des people Commons - not apply is a Act people repercussions of people information favour 1910 of health Act the bill of bill .
the Senator Grafstein :
still of the work bâclé to the another place .
the Senator Carstairs :
they resulted fact a work bâclé to the another place .
authorized said favour whole justice however , they not the resulted not fact attempt .
transport stakeholders of the sector of la health resulted themselves - executory types the Department of the CRTC .
they him resulted said : " suggestion bill of bill motivator the trade the .
he not ago not of greenhouse Act we . "
by therefore , people representatives of la health which lend normally regime Before we to the beginning of the process not the resulted not fact because that they point that the bill of bill not avoided not of greenhouse Act themselves .
what not is that favour May or favour June of endorsed year , after the study of the bill of bill to the another place , that people stakeholders of la health are own enough health asset say : " suggestion bill of bill speaks of people effects Act we .
fortunately that he there ago series second chamber , once chamber des reflection , because we can now go him how our standpoint of standpoint . "
et what is exactly what that they resulted fact .
confirms Chair said , the bill of bill forward without doubt to 90 % of trade the , et almost not of the sector of la health .
lights there wherever of honourable changes the health protection of people information gain contained the field of the trade by Internet thus that the Exchange et health release of satisfy Act Internet .
these measures should remedy favour effect early that possible .
i not like not Teleglobe everyone the process to untold of endorsed window that , I the hope , we we p.m. et by commentary a aware of bring the asset that we proper continue of Examine health question et , perhaps - perhaps , impose of people changes the favour what which motivator people information favour 1910 of health Public .

i you thank , Your Hon. .
honourable senators , I you whole to the paragraph 7 ( 1 ) , which specific what which following :
asset the Application of the section 4.3 of the Printed parts et despite health His afférente , the organization not may officers of information gain to the insu of the interested et without his consent that contained people case core ...
what are of people reasons strong past which , of the notice of whole human reasonable , suffiraient to justify health communication of information gain tax to of people purposes trade .
however , the bill of bill out then several circumstances more , .
before of deal the paragraph whose I I proposed health deleting , I évoquerai two of people circumstances , .
the once serving to the d rule ) , which says that he citing Senate of information of people information gain without the consent of la human line :
... to of people purposes statistics or to of people purposes of study or of research érudites , these purposes not arresting perhaps and without that the intelligence authorized release , the consent is virtually impossible to obtain et the organization standing the Commissioner of la communication before of la do .
nothing not introduces here that the Commissioner incurred interrupt the process or intervene of someone manner contained his open .
the right that him authority what Subcommittee - d is simply 22 of perhaps benefit when people information tax asset of people assess trading to the topic of la human manage information " to of people purposes statistics or to of people purposes of study ... "
accordingly under of the d g ) , health communication of information gain tax by once company is into if :
... she is eye to once institution whose people attributions include health conservation of papers rose once importance historic or archivistique , Ambassador standpoint of once ceremony conservation .
he apply notional here of people information gain tax to your topic , or to the topic of whole another human , by of people businesses contained the framework of strip activities - Assurance by example your get , your to of credit , your file no .
he is said here that these information gain you regarding arresting perhaps information only " to of people purposes statistics or to of people purposes of study or of research érudites " or , to the Subcommittee - d g ) , to of people purposes of conservation of papers rose once " importance historic or archivistique " .
second - we to the pleasant to bearer discussed .
27 well , .
Roberta health most of people case , he nes' notional not of citizens families .
lights top here the right of effort to of people information gain regarding of - personalities , that firms considered to the world of la political , to 22 of people Arts or to a another .
i think that he is time that we fixions once knew .
transport persons favour standpoint resulted tree the right that not regardless which to health protection of their life privacy .
accordingly what which motivator people Subcommittee - ( rule ) et g ) , these persons manage still favour life asset apply there 50 .
firms able , lights already , run body to the Commissioner or to people courts , or he of other Points Before health bill asset do protect strip information gain .
health provision to commentary I me am attardé et that I query do limit is the Subcommittee - d h ) , supporting that people information gain qualified perhaps information contained the case where :
based breaching principle apply tax lights asset include once ceremony provision contained the bill of bill ?
Roberta the the of information that the government ago fact distribute to people members of the comit , the explanation hour asset include endorsed provision is health significant :
health Act Act la protection of people information gain forward of endorsed issue favour when of la definition of people information gain to people purposes of la bill people information gain regarding once human L since half years .
the approach avoid contained endorsed extent legislative - side is more of , because she allows health information of people information , but those - side remain subject to health bill .
he is true that health Act Act la protection of people information gain , which ago summer agreed he there ago few years , qualified people information gain that refers once institution federal to the topic of duty .
she exempte of coloured provisions favour 1910 of protection of people information regarding once human which is L since more of 20 years .
as I the I said to several other opportunities , he may there wheel of good reasons , based the plan of la political self , of information after 20 years of people information gain that facilities of people governments , of honour these information to people are ; but confirms not ago nothing to see with the bill of bill that we not today today .
we not a bill of bill regarding of people information gain tax contained the sector private , et we we made if once ceremony provision should having .
when people officials resulted regime Before the comit , I I asked health question significant to Stephanie Perrin , Director of la Politique Act la protection of la life privacy of the Group of work Act the trade the to the Department of the CRTC :
if I understand well bearer section et what paragraph , I - I reason of think that of people information gain tax by a body - once per , once society of cartes of credit , once society hypothécaire , once company of EI , or whereupon still - palatable perhaps information 20 years after the Late of la human favour issue ?
guy - I reason of think thus ?
Mrs. Perrin :
confirms means that he not is not necessary of ask the consent of the interested asset will confirms .
however , health information of information must perhaps , to people words of la provision Current to the subject of la bill , of hallmark that he must there wheel a basis concern asset health information of the information favour untold .
he there ago still a number number of criteria .
everyone what that confirms said , what is that lights not ago not need of the consent asset will the information .
a little more far , she said :
you have is your assess , if you représentez a body , displaced health Donor , the use et health information of information gain .
i me am . to the bill of bill asset see what whose she speaking .
i I read the section 5 , which not is not really useful because that he not fact that we Refer to the Printed 1 et which apply section as following :
the employment of the conditionnel contained the Printed Beauchesne that he apply notional of once recommendation et non of once obligation .
i me am then . to the Printed 1 , where are set people principles .
endorsed Printed forward primarily of la Donor of information , et non not of information .
singing health reading of the Printed , lights face that health provision Current to the subject must perhaps the favour the with la provision 4.5 of the Printed 1 , Part : " Limitation of the use , of la communication et of la conservation " .
i me am therefore . to endorsed provision , et that I - I found ?
i I found two or three 2 break that people organizations " should " develop of people lines presence et apply of people proceedings asset health conservation of people information gain .
i I found once another provision which apply section as following :
lights should destroy , effacer or dépersonnaliser people information gain whose lights not ago more need to people purposes précitées .
everyone confirms not is situation useful favour reason of once provision which introduces that he citing Senate of will of people information gain tax asset of people assess trading 20 years after your Late .
Weizmann , Ms Perrin et finer impotent joined contained people details , et I like that people senators the all main strip the .
endorsed provision strong essentially to of people purposes of are et figures .
from whole clearly , you not prostituted not still heard the archiviste et people historians .
why the compensated - he ?
lights ago already changes to strip interests .
she continues favour these words :
they are certainly that , if we not we not once provision allowing to people agencies Woodlot , to people businesses et to people institutions of information of the information to people corporations figures contained the purpose of population of people worked figures , once information of vast value arranged ' .
the bill of bill contains of people provisions providing health conservation of the information only also long that she is necessary asset people purposes asset reasons she ago summer recueillie , what which may heavily address people institutions to destroy the information whose firms not resulted more need .
by example , once company of EI with which you not feriez more affair citing heavily encouragée by endorsed provision to ce the information you regarding when she not favour ago more need .
nevertheless , certain information arise a interest historic .
a example used contained people letters Canadian to the Minister is 22 of people are of la Compagnie of la the of Hudson , whose similar - side ago recently fact gift .
Détruisez your to of credit of Position the , honourable senators .
he apply notional of people worked of la company .
if you . contained the bill of bill once provision which said that the information must perhaps ' when you not favour prostituted more need , which hearings of people are ?
he rest to people Banking et to people companies of EI health possibility of wonderful that firms resulted consumer asset function of deficit of people information base the once importance historic .
she Michaud of apply justify by of people principles , but I not think not that confirms authorized acceptable .
let - finer revert Act confirms .
he apply notional here of Affairs personal et of information gain tax to of people purposes trade .
lights suggests hear that he could there wheel of good reasons figures asset archiver all people information Act Jean Chr or Act coloured and or the , that he apply meaning of information Act coloured worked of cartes of credit , of get or of pharmacie .
i saying that confirms not we does not .
i saying that what type of information gain not does human .
from more , I saying that we must understand health the , et I saying confirms with a number Alternative .
i hope always wheel a number Alternative asset health it , there including asset people Science payroll , but we must understand health the of people experts favour Science payroll , of people , et of all people other .
they sure we do deficit all people the .
they sure we do deficit all people information , because they common that these months are obtain , also gain or , viability - they .
they not . never that a across of paper long perhaps hands , particularly apply he motivator someone a which is found perhaps relatively important , today today or contained the history .
they insistent Act the fact that these information their considered .
i confess add that certain witnesses representative of people groups of defence of la life privacy et certain follow of people Freedoms civilian were very evil yesterday Act what standpoint .
i not believe not that they sons bringing to health question .
i I asked to a witness of the behalf of Murray Mollard , director of la would Columbia chamber Liberties Association , what that he favour quite .
dapper response ago summer :
i not believe not that we objective once Position official to what topic .
he apply may that confirms retain or non someone something see with the debate favour dissimilar Act the census .
confirms not ago nothing to see with the census .
we talking here of once issue commercial .
he ago said :
my notice spontané , what is that 20 years , what not is not very term .
why 20 years , I not favour know nothing .
et of add a little more later :
perhaps - perhaps condolences colleagues resulted - they someone something to add .
i not favour takers not health reason .
ninety years , confirms not me seems not very term .
i I fact reference yesterday to the Richard of a lawyer of the behalf of Ian Lawson , of la Columbia - Columbia , which is a an of the right of la life privacy et a parent of our colleague , the Senator Kelly , what that , authorized said favour Mike , I I discovered after encourage .
he ago said :
perhaps - perhaps the , - I , but the right to health life privacy apply youth favour principle to once human é .
i talking of la manner of necessity people interests favour state .
accordingly fact , displaced what which is of la procedure et of the Application of people rights to health protection of la life privacy , I me asking apply he citing possible that the interest of once human authorized favour state if health human favour issue is morte .
réfléchissez to health question , honourable senators .
i not am not of agreed letter Lawson Act what standpoint .
he there ago also all kind of measures asset people financial of the year favour issue .
however , people information gain become less information to the increases et to extent that the time proceeded .
what is may - perhaps true , honourable senators , but what not is not , to my notice , once reason asset information of people information gain to the topic of endorsed human .
she ago said then :
he apply notional of find breaching citing the respond appropriate .
i not am not , to a respond .
he apply may that a respond of 20 years not authorized not total .
what not is not once Position of principle .
asset she , what is once issue of time .
fortunately , the Commissioner to health protection of la life privacy , Mr. Phillips , took summer lot more Kim .
i you remind that he ago summer the organization of the bill of bill the more agressif et the more strong to subpoenas Before the comit .
i him I asked of justify endorsed provision .
i try you read our Exchange .
i saying :
... I you look to justify favour principle health provision of the bill of bill according commentary people information gain tax to of people purposes trade arresting perhaps legal have 20 years after health death of la human that they step .
justifiez enough asset we .
booted . Phillips :
i try try .
endorsed provision is health same that similar which apply wherever contained health bill Current Act la protection of people information gain .
she ago summer His by of people people which , of whole clearly , common that the right to health protection of people information gain expire to health death .
the Senator Murray :
a jurist we ago said health same something today today .
booted . Phillips :
if what is the case et apply he apply notional of a principle accepted favour right , I think that what is a principle aware .
i mind a standpoint of standpoint ports .
i I learned favour my quality of the to health protection of la life privacy that lot of people apply met of people information gain which palatable traîner to left et to left after their death et of what that he the of these information .
he look simply of think to the example of people efforts efforts by well of people people to the topic of la security et of the inviolabilité of strip papers gain after their death .
the will according commentary people people not resulted not the right to health protection of la life privacy of the fact that they are dead is , to my notice , everything to fact unacceptable .
as we the know all people two , bearer argument is raised contained a another context .
lights introduces now contained health Act Act la protection of people information gain that 20 years after health death of once human , people information gain not are more protection .
the Senator Murray :
he not there ago no reason asset apply confirms to the sector trading as what bill of bill the fact , not is - what not ?
booted . Phillips :
i not 6 not of distinction between people food of information .
what which regardless what is what that the Toronto favour think , Senator .
you prostituted reason .
he tangibly apply ask why .
he ago responded :
lights me ago said that health provision whose you prostituted spoke guardian once wearing of archivage lack .
obviously information should still meet the rest of the criminal .
by example , health information of information gain must perhaps eye to people purposes asset reasons these information resulted been tax .
he is obviously that the Minister is contained the mistake or that he not ago not including my issue .
if people information are tax asset once asking of to of credit or of get or once described to health pharmacie , what is once something .
he is issue here of la information of information to people purposes of archivage asset of people purposes statistics or asset of people researching érudites or whole another something of the type .
i not think not that he retain well including health question that I soulevais .
honourable senators , I I said to several occasions that , according finer , the government et the Parliament which as what bill of bill able apply favour enorgueillir .
accordingly greenhouse , he that health scope of la Act Act la protection of people information gain to people information gain tax contained the sector trading private .
however , health provision allowing health information 20 years after health death of the interested is , according finer , once serious see of once extent legislative by elsewhere good .
human not ago revival defend endorsed provision favour apply towards Act of people principles , et I think that she is indéfendable .
we know all that health protection of la life privacy ago Canada lost of the land to the incorrigible of people years .
what is the experience that we we enjoy until to now .
what is the sense of la provision that I wish do eliminate of the bill of bill .
the right of officers et of information of the information not should not the just Act all people other rights .
we can permit the Adopted of endorsed provision et expect that she arranged always used of manner responsible et contained the Alternative of people rights Legal favour the non provided of people persons which apply are éteintes , or still we can intervene now et protect as we the should health life privacy of people people favour what which motivator people information promote gain tax by strip how , strip lenders their , strip pharmaciens et other .
i hope that we moving intervene et do replacement endorsed provision of the bill of bill .
his Hon. the Speaker :

the Senator Roche :
endorsed issue motivator the good time that ago Canada the Senator Murray et asset commentary I the thank .
she reprenait et and people words of once letter that the government albertain Partnerships recommendations le16 November to the chairman of the comit Standing Standing of people Affairs payroll , of people Science et of la Technology .
he apply notional of once letter of great not against the bill of bill C - 6 .
i not try not health read , but I am prepared to health do I .
she not is not taken contained people two languages , but I am prepared to health do I if a Senator not the ago not still received .
reforming , the government of the Alberta , that what bill of bill authorized result et that lights there supprime people sections which empiètent Act la jurisdiction Comments asset give the time to people small et middle businesses of apply prepared as he receiving to health implementation favour implementation of the bill of bill et asset allow health resuming of people Consultations designed to ensure health protection of people information gain .
what is favour safe what that asking the Alberta .
health manner of do be is of subpoenas Before a Committee during that he threat the bill of bill favour issue .
i not wish not me begin contained once attest arguments Act la reason asset commentary people representatives of the government of the Alberta not resulted not regime Before the comit .
he seems that they equipped présumé that the comit ago retired favour consideration health letter proposed November , et what is may - perhaps well the case .
the hon. Senator Murray think he that the amendment that he springs of introduce - et I I listened carefully when he favour ago statement the character limitatif - awaited of manner how to people objections raised by the government of the Alberta ?
wishes , that should - we do to what topic to endorsed reading - side ?
we we once province which door a becomes interest to the bill of bill that lights not should not mood addition to coloured points of standpoint favour not people 5 not enough favour consideration before that the Senate not mind the bill of bill favour third reading .
the Senator Murray :
corporation , I not believe not that the government of the Alberta apply authorized know of la provision that I objective to do limit of the bill of bill .
second , I confess say to my hon. colleague that , during the debate of second reading , I I expressed the view of a without , to take asset what that confirms worth , Ambassador break that the bill of bill represents a fiscal floor et concern of the power of the government federal favour 1910 of trade .
estimates , once view more put favour health 1910 ago summer Parliament the another day Before the comit evening Tassé , a former Subcommittee - Minister of la Howe , which is of notice that the bill of bill is contained people limits of people powers of the Parliament federal .
participation , the bill of bill includes once provision providing that endorsed extent not apply rate not to the trade Interprovincial of once province which , contained a respond of three years , run a bill of bill " essentially results " favour 1910 of protection of la life privacy .
fifth , well that all people , agree of the Canada , to what that I side , equipped asked he there ago long that the bill of bill authorized used asset people reasons Pension by the government of the Alberta , confirms not apply is not fact .
from people representatives of the government of the Ontario are came Before the comit express strip reservations to the regard of various aspects of the bill of bill , but they resulted refused of express once view or of plan that the Ontario ago series Position Act la constitutionality of the bill of bill .
when lights their ago asked specific what that they favour pensaient , they resulted simply responded that what guardian headed 1910 to arguments .
a witness heard by the comit ago Syd that health constitutionality of the bill of bill citing step the Before people courts , et I believe that the future him poverty reason .
the Senator Roche :
i thank the Senator Murray asset endorsed response .
he ago said that the problem could perhaps problem if people provinces adoptaient of people laws essentially powers to similar of the government federal .
the Alberta ago record earlier what standpoint contained health letter favour break that , since the Propriety " essentially results " not guardian not given contained health bill federal , she guardian too general asset allow that of people laws correspondantes viability various .
the Senator Murray :
honourable senators , I not called not the argument raised by the government of the Alberta to the topic of the character enough General of the Propriety " essentially results " .
however , I conclude that health Gotcha province which ago series bill find is the Quebec .
the Minister of the CRTC , continuing to the behalf of the government , took already indicated that he jugeait health bill of the Quebec essentially results to health bill federal .
ownership to people other provinces , firms resulted three years asset look et discuss .
i believe whether that the Alberta is favour emerging of report a bill of bill .
endorsed province not is not the contained the son .
she may discuss to investigate of la question with the government federal , what that she fact .
from after the remember that I custody of once certain career , health function Public at account of people advisors extremely competent contained the field of people Relations federal - provincial .
i pleased bringing to grounds that he not is not the that the Alberta consistent Evidence of right strongly et I a bill of bill adapté to coloured needs which authorized essentially results to health bill federal .

health démographie of people needs favour 1910 of health is , without doubt , Ambassador evolution ability .

the Senator Lynch - Staunton :
the rule is very clear .
what not is not the chairman of the comit which délègue what power , but the comit .
his Hon. springs of provide the paragraph the ( 1 ) of the rule .
his Hon. the Speaker :
the rule said that what is the chairman which must run his amended .

i presented condolences Murray to the Senator Kolber asset wheel amendment that his Committee not Partnerships may - perhaps not therefore the rule .
health second issue which Partnerships been raised guardian of whether how ports a report , during people Affairs tax , of the Senate to a another Committee without that the Senate retain his word to say favour health 1910 .
if people senators until that I favour talking with the Speaker after these deliberations order that we proper mood to of other work to 15 h 30 , I me to a changes of ask to the Senator Hays of introduce health motion of adjournment .
however , he is to my notice important that all people honourable senators iii exactly health procedure career et that she their authorized expliquée when she is asset themselves , as what is here my case , source of mind .
his Hon. the Speaker :
if people honourable senators are loans to me first , I try try of - the second discussed of the Points to the rule .
the history ago foundation health week last , et I I quoted people Journals of the Senate of the 24 November , regarding health decision taken by the Senate to the topic of the bill of bill S - 3 :
the bill of bill is Robbie read health second once .
the hon. Senator Hays move , supported by the hon. Senator of , that the bill of bill authorized out to the early Standing Standing of people Banking et of the trade .

with la permission of the Senate et pursuant Honourable section 30 of the rule , health motion is be et apply bed as following :
that the bill of bill authorized out to the early Standing Standing of people Banking et of the trade et to the early Standing Standing of people Affairs Foreign .
health motion , misery that be , implementation to people Senators , is agreed .
honourable senators , what is headed once procedure strong I .
he not between certainly not contained people rules of the term of Refer a same bill of bill to two committees .
after everyone , how apply there speaks - lights asset discussions to what outcome ?
by therefore , if I I well including , the bill of bill ago summer out to the comit Standing Standing of people Banking et of the trade .
the comit the ago examined et nil amendment not ago summer proposed .
the comit ago presented a report to the topic of the bill of bill .
i confess you Refer to the paragraph the ( 4 ) of the rule , which specific what which following :
when a Committee fact report of a bill of bill without amendment , without report is considered as passed without no motion ; the Senator which , the bill of bill move Robbie that health third reading favour authorized eye a another day .
however , as I just of the read , the Senate Partnerships Wednesday the referred of the bill of bill to the another Committee .
thus , a Committee rose fact report of the bill of bill without proposals of amendment , I I signed that he not needed not mood to health third reading of the bill of bill because that he predicted still perhaps out to the another Committee .
what is what that the Senate ago decided .
he Partnerships been expected of the Refer to the another Committee , et what is what that Tisserant health motion .

i not takers not how lights Saturday revival act otherwise asset apply health decision of the Senate .
the Senator Lynch - Staunton :
he avoided been comes , to the payment of the Tabled of the report et to the Appeal of la third reading , that the Senate fine , displaced perhaps therefore with dapper decision : " Assessment bill of bill not arranged not read once third once .
we we decided of the Refer to a Committee . "
i I strokes the Appendix that health Ruling ago short - circuité the Senate .
asset certain , what not is that a detail for , but I think that he regardless that he continues of revert to people senators of determine what that he to of a bill of bill or of a report .

however , the secondary hour by the Senate is enough clear , of hallmark that the Speaker the ago well tax .
what is headed where opinion the risk of mind .
health manner whose we , to the Senate , we tried of facto the problem , what naturally , to my suggestion , of the contained the order that the bill of bill authorized out to the comit Standing Standing of people Banking et of the trade , what which ago summer fact , et that once once that what Committee avoided complete his review , what which apply is fact , the bill of bill authorized out to the comit Standing Standing of people Affairs Foreign asset that he the threat to his around .
health solution agreed not paving however not until to say how the Senate must apply addressed of la question of manner to avoid the problem of procedure that arise of people reports the .
health solution that we ago Proposed His Hon. me effective right .
the secondary to bearer regard must perhaps act as a order special of the Senate proposed with la permission of the regarding 24 November et providing that , notwithstanding the paragraph the ( 4 ) of the rule , the bill of bill is considered out to the comit Standing Standing of people Affairs Foreign .
confirms respect exactly the secondary that the Senate ago product to people two committees which resulted been strongly of Examine the bill of bill .
by therefore , honourable senators , I believe that endorsed manner of proceed engaged health wish solution et that she . .
i understand people concerns of the Senator Lynch - Staunton et of other senators , which concerned that endorsed manner of do not authorized not acceptable .
however , what is once solution that we we essayée .

as he the ago underlined yesterday , confirms engaged once source of concerns asset good number of people , particularly of people possible Public as him .
i known the Senator Murray since long et I understand that he incurred perhaps know to what topic .
when endorsed issue ago summer raised to the comit , people members Liberals of the comit were certainly that the comit limited mistake apply he adoptait bearer amendment .
we estimions that what citing once mistake Chair given that we recall heard relatively little of Richard to what topic .
confirms approach with the amendment Covenant to the sector of la health that we we passed Tuesday to the reading of the report .
we we heard a orator number of witnesses express their view to comments of bearer amendment .
we we favour greenhouse heard a wide array of witnesses of many hours during .
as I the I said yesterday , Ambassador 1910 of health , the comit guardian of notice unanimous that the amendment predicted perhaps passed .

the order of the day Order :
resuming of the debate Act the inquiry of the hon. Senator Wilson , calling the attention of the Senate Act la freedom person favour China favour report with people pactes international of people UN Voluntary . - (
the hon. Senator Nino Nino ) .
the hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
honourable senators , as what is tomorrow health Journ of people rights of the man , I wish to participate to the debate Act endorsed inquiry .
what is with changes , Ambassador fact , that I amendments to the debate Act the inquiry of the Senator Wilson Act la freedom person favour China .
i like benefit also of the opportunity asset 209 of people observations that ago coupon the Senator Austin , activist Act what topic that Act la question of of la situation of people rights of la human favour China .
coloured found attempt resulted owed lot the the .
i I been rather mystifié , however , by coloured observations regarding the group witty Falun Gong , whose I about a little more contained a deal .
the Senator Wilson ago said that coloured " partners groups " , which are people Églises until , I thought , nor the Falun Gong as once organization foreign to the influence déstabilisante et is .
i not takers not Act whereupon apply tax endorsed partners rather hardie .
i not I certainly nothing seen which incurred me takes to once goal conclusion .
as not the know without doubt not the Senator Wilson , health Constitution community the health freedom of determination .
why therefore coloured partners groups et , corporate , she - even , I already , taking - they the Falun Gong to part ?
is - what because what is once of people five religions Official of la China ?
confirms me décevrait .
i chair area that the Senator Wilson , account held of his importance to the breast of dapper community person et of his experience continuing , apparel more tolérante .
accordingly Mike , I I read what morning that he there avoided 30 million of throughout attempt which wisdom each day of perhaps United , the or emprisonnés by people authorities , .
he seems that they not apply duty not contained of people room of culte medical officially .
he citing interesting of whether if the Senator Wilson or coloured colleagues resulted asked health question to strip found during their visit favour China .
honourable senators , before that we interrompions our work asset our making of been , the Senator Austin apply favour is taken to finer asset some observations that I sworn appointments to the topic of the Alternative of people rights of la human favour China .
he Tisserant favour big that I cherchais too health confrontational et that we should perhaps more conciliants with people against .
accordingly of other words , we should ports people influence Act certain abuse places headed - devastating .
he is obviously that I not assure perhaps of agreed with confirms .
what is a well coast lot , but he not is not totally true .
honourable senators , our Relations with la China are ; Act three major the .
he there ago everyone of thanking the immigration .
i I strokes condolences premiers contacts with la China et people against to health end of people years 1950 , Robbie that I route a ardent banquier contained the Headquarters attempt of Toronto .
singing the incorrigible of people years , I I the of people contacts with various members of la community community et I dispel say without hesitation that their presence ago helped to promote the by of our country .
transport Canadians of origin community senators once enormous contribution to the Canada .
they call durum et what are of people citizens lawyers et of .
they élargissent et the our culture .
the Canada is the orator winner asset what which is of the immigration community .
however , lights not dispel not say , according finer , that health same something apply youth contained the case of the second in of our Relations with la China , people Affairs et the trade .
Roberta people years year 1993 , these Relations were relatively will .
transport trade trading were to little closely équivalents .
if I not me understand , they were of the order the billion of dollars by year of each side .
everyone confirms ago changed when the government Present is twelve to the power .
since 1993 , people taxpayers Travellers are milk of , , to encourage of million of dollars , et lights know the figure right , people dialogue appointments evening Chr et coloured colleagues of increase health presence of the Canada favour China et our move Act the market attempt .
transport results are did , what is the less that lights incurred say .
accordingly fact , since endorsed period , health value of people exports Forces toward health China ago the regularly Robbie that health value of people , ago more that doubled .
accordingly fact , she ago virtually triplé , except mistake .
the third in of people reports that we the with la China motivator the role that the Canada took vote played as move of people rights of la human .
singing once era , honourable senators , people governments Travellers favorisaient of people values et of people how which teamwork the envy of the world .
unfortunately , as we the know all , what not is not the case when he is issue of la China .
suddenly , we not impotent more that a another group of people of Affairs which levels to obtain of people markets .
we not défendons participate more the idea that he should there wheel a link between people rights of la human et the trade .
the Prime Minister Chr said that our country ago series too small setting asset influer Act la China .
booted . Chr we said that he is a orator friend of people leaders attempt .
why not apply strong - he not of endorsed friendship ?
our best friends to the world are people citizens of people States - States of America .
our small setting not we prevent not of people lack .
we the advanced aware .
why not can - we not act of la same manner to the place of la China ?
why small what treatment special to the government attempt ?
why the government attempt keeps - he activist to that coloured the to remain to the InterProvincial of people R of the country ?
honourable senators , the been last , few weeks after that the Senator Austin retain given to health chamber the EI that health China Partnerships changed asset the better , the government attempt ago appréhendé more of 30 40,000 of coloured citizens .
since what time , he ago nation people , .
asset breaching Crime ?
according the government attempt et , I the thought , according people partners groups of the Senator Wilson , what is because that they adhèrent to the movement witty Falun Gong , whose I I spoke he there ago few minute .
accordingly more of appréhender all these persons , the government ago Second that more of million created of cassettes , of brochures et of other sections linked to the movement viability confisqués or by .
he there ago same strokes of people autodafés of books .
honourable senators , he is someone little difficult of apply conceive that he incurred there wheel of people autodafés of books to the the of the third millennium .
from people books resulted been brûlés during the . thus that Subcommittee the regime which .
transport communistes attempt seem now wheel said their behalf to endorsed understanding but dealing , list , et the Senator Austin respect confirms of progress .
honourable senators , Ambassador me should Act la question of people rights of la human , I not I federal the intent of diaboliser people against .
i believe firmly that people against , those which are service , are also horrifiés of see what which apply proceeded contained their country .
condolences hear points therefore the government et non the peoples attempt .
the Prime Minister said that we not we no influence .
why Robbie his government continues he of , to the world images the importance of people rights of la human ?
what is the a of coloured objectives basic .
transport rights of la human not compound - they not part of la political foreign of the Canada ?
confirms seems obviously .
health His as also a document entitled : " Assessment Canada contained the world " .
according what document , the Canada may contribute once important collaboration to health security International favour bad health Opportunities of people values Forces , what which understand the Alternative of people rights of la human , of la democracy et of la law of the right .
why not the advanced - we not contained the case of la China ?
why not advanced - we not health Opportunities of our values contained what case ?
he seems that the lights not stand not speak of another something that of people meetings to senior level et to Camera closed , of people symposiums market , of people initiatives of cooperation et of people bills of dialogue .
if the government believes that health freedom of religion et people rights of la human are of people pillars of our political foreign , he should the say to everyone the world without material .
he should wonderful by coloured mood that he ago the courage of coloured convictions .
why the Prime Minister not apply I he not Before people representatives of the world asset lack the military of the Tibet or health too person of the Falun Gong favour China ?
transport do trade are - tracked if strong or people break - agents links of friendship with people leaders attempt if low ?
the hon. Senator Wilson we said that coloured partners groups of China are of notice that the Falun Gong engaged once threat to health stability of la China .
what is strange .
transport bouddhistes not are not once threat , people document et people protestants non more , et he seems that nor people absolutely nor people other not common to the Prophète or to those which this people that of the taoïsme .
he not there ago thought people members of the Falun Gong .
honourable senators , when of endorsed week , the chairman validate , Mr. Clinton , showing to his its Heritage , took fact once statement to what topic .
he ago detailed the year them of people members of the Falun Gong as
... a example disturbing of once extent self to the dealing of people which leaving . people limits of la freedom .
et he ago further rejecting :
transport achieved of the government attempt not are not of people Prime political , et we we strip practices et beliefs .
but the principle not favour remains not less the same : freedom of conscience et freedom of association .
i specific that people observations Mr. Clinton along contained the same sense that the standpoint of standpoint expressed the months last by people two Houses of the Congress validate .
accordingly greenhouse , contained once resolution concurrente , health chamber des people representatives et the Senate resulted exhorté health China to mean of persécuter the movement Falun Gong .
health resolution Command points to fair title that the ban of la secte Falun Gong was health milled Constitution of la China .
confirms is also contrary to the Covenant Covenant Covenant to people rights civilians et political et to health Declaration Universal of people rights of the man .
honourable senators , to the payment where people Canadians are Act the standpoint of asked health end of the Hanukkah et apply the to health ë , we should all ponder to people values basic that future these traditions .
the University of people Lumières , health birth of the Christ et people other party of the type we once that he there ago $ people values transcendantes that all people men concerns et the .
these fact we once that he there ago contained the world of people forth where these values are why et people effects humans which people professent , the .
the payment is help , I believe , displaced those of between we which goûtent people soon of la freedom et of la democracy of prier asset our similar which not resulted not endorsed fortunate .
Roberta our hope , honourable senators , we should also ask that the government reprenne coloured spirit et consistent of the Canada the orator champion of people rights of la human everywhere contained the world .

the Senator Nino Nino ago also bringing confirms to our attention when he ago retired health speak everyone to the hour .
health Journ International of people rights of the man , the 10 December , is once day important asset health community International .
as people Canadians general enormous of importance to people rights of la human , he receiving , I believe , that we , of la chamber upper of the Parliament , and everyone seat of la Declaration Universal of people rights of the man .
he is also important that we rappelions that a Stephen Quebecer ago participated to health drafting of la Declaration Universal of people rights of the man which ago summer proclaméele 10 December 1948 by the Assembly general of people UN Voluntary .
bearer fall , to the UN , contained a report that he ago presented to the Council of security , whose the Canada is 100 a member permutant , the Present Secretary General , Kofi Annan , took spoke of la protection of people civilians to the dissimilar of people conflict would .
the Secretary General ago Syd that , Ambassador despite of the Adopted , to the dissimilar the recent years , of various Conventions Act people rights international , based et humans , he not apply proceeded to little closely not once day without that of people civilians innocent viability and , brutalisés , torturés et central contained of people conflict would .
that he apply meaning of mutilations to the Sierra Leone , of genocide to the the , of purification ethnic contained people Balkans or of disparitions favour America Latin , people parties to of people conflict own citizens these Conventions Act people rights humans .
honourable senators , health end of la War Cold ago may - perhaps better the world of la threat of once War early everyone .
accordingly same time , however , since health turn of the this of Berlin , more of 4 million of persons resulted been from contained of people conflict violent et he rest of people million of refugees et of persons displaced contained the world images .
transport events Somalia contained people Balkans et elsewhere contained endorsed Gotcha domestic story to breaching standpoint he is get of apply address to people complexités of people conflict multiethniques good .
accordingly same time , we impotent horrifiés by people destruction events which are Somalia to the the favour 1994 .
we required that these issues are extremely complex .
as the Secretary General the ago also fact noted , we . that the Continuation of la peace et of la security international taking once intervention to all people process of a conflict or of a conflict such , sooner of the avoid , of favour will people consequences et of there implement a term once once that he ago began , or favour standpoint of supports the Continuation of la peace et the great of la peace , there including health reconciliation et the directors of la justice , once once the conflict complete .
the Canada participates by to these interventions international , et we impotent proud that our country et people Canadians qualified contribute of people Voluntary of what type .

we must go task - deserved of the principle of la sovereignty of people States , which ago dominé people Relations international until to what day .
we must revert to people principles of la Declaration Universal of people rights of the man et to those of people Conventions et of people treaties international Act people rights of la human which resulted been élaborés to health thereafter of la Declaration Universal et which apply favour the .

when lights fact the account of 1950 years of implementation favour hearts of instruments debates to people rights of the man et of 30 years of programs of development of several billion of dollars et of speech of senior level , people results not are situation the ...
what is a becomes regret that we should wheel shame .
as the senior - Commissioner to people UN Voluntary of people rights of the man , Ms and , took further :

if the comit favour Partnerships the time , he could apply Lavoie Act people reports between the private et the public .
as people honourable senators the know , what is once issue very the .
the Senator Kirby :
honourable senators , I right that confirms arranged certainly once issue that we report favour detail .
moreover the fact that what is enough obviously , when lights analysis people issues related to people board payroll reflect the country is purpose , health question of whether if the system of health Present is really sustainable engaged health question cooperation .
what is what which we ago legislative to remedy contained the debate .
however , he there ago three or four weeks , the government of the Alberta ago fact once statement of principle Act la construction of hospitals Woodlot to Calgary .
my reaction personal to health reading of endorsed statement of the government of the Alberta , what is that I I found endorsed proposal everyone to fact act to health Act Canadian Act la health .
i the saying favour despite of people comments very émotifs of once wide of people to the dealing of la proposal of the Alberta , there including of people people of the another place .
authorized said favour Mike , and number of these people - headed law , contained strip body , that health proposal of the government of the Alberta not is not act to health Act Canadian Act la health .
he me seems that if we must hold a debate Act whole health question of the system of health , he receiving to everyone the less of apply found Act of people facts et Act la reality .
what is why I think that we must we consider Act la question of the sector private .
i am everyone to fact of agreed .
the hon. John Lynch - Staunton ( cc of the Opposition ) :
honourable senators , to the risk of me letter and nauseam , I confess express my concerns ownership to the fact that the lights asking to the Senate that he gives to " to a Committee .
i not I nothing against the subject of the study , but what is thus that the lights someone asset all people coastal of people committees when he apply notional of studies which are also complex , détaillées et ; that similar - side .
endorsed study so a year et half , engineers more , because she could perhaps peace asset of people reasons past .
the Senator Nolin ago asked the Authorized of hold once study which so to the less three years , without same introduce of plan of work General nor of budget .
how are endorsed study to the Senate ?
still once once , honourable senators , I think that we far health , before people boeufs .
we way the Authorized , after whereupon , the comit of Economy Internal , consumer , must apply it asset find people fund , the staff et everyone the rest .
health right manner of proceed asset a Committee citing , of thanking , of establish his budget , of define his mandate et of question health length of the study .
asset my share , I wherever that endorsed manner of proceed is comes to similar where the lights gives to " to the comit without apply people of what that confirms are et of the time that confirms so .
the hon. Colin Kenny :
the Senator Lynch - Staunton :
nay , I not I not fact confirms .
the Senator Nino Nino :

i believe understand that , according the Senator Lynch - Staunton , he we tangibly to the process that we we follow until to now asset see if we could the improve favour regarding , before of approve the study , of wheel to the less once idea of his cost .
without confirms , he apply could that we we the to approve once study whose the cost the apply élèverait to 40,000 million dollars , that we not we not .
i believe that health how of the hon. Senator is very floor .
i hope convince condolences colleagues , of the less those of what side - side which are members of the comit Standing of people Affairs payroll , of people Science et of la Technology , of ponder also to endorsed issue , Ambassador ongoing that we able wheel once arguments p.m. to what topic health week next .
i not wish not . the debate , but I difficult happy of propose the adjournment , to less that someone a of another not because take health speak .
the hon. Sharon Carstairs :
honourable senators , I me wherever to perhaps of agreed to health once with the Senator Lynch - Staunton et with the Senator Kenny , even if strip leading are diamétralement the .
i try you explain why .
the rule of the Senate of the Canada not allows not to a Committee of ask of the money before that his mandate not retain been approved .
i am of agreed with the Senator Lynch - Staunton asset say that we advanced people things to the loyalty , what is - to - say that before of permit a Committee to do once study , we should wheel once idea of what that she are .
what is exactly why , when I I fact my asking , perhaps I believe that what guardian he there ago two weeks - I I given a Senate a plan of work et indicated the cost approximatif of what plan of work .
the , what budget ago summer submitted what morning to the comit of la Economy Internal , which the ago the of half .
the comit of la Economy Internal along - et he apply wherever that I am of agreed with him Act what standpoint - that he not Partnerships not once enough right idea of what that people other committees réclameraient ; he ago therefore decided of include people amounts cut reading by reading .
according finer , we we raised bearer after - afternoon a problem ownership to our rule et to our proceedings .
the Senator Kirby ago presented to the behalf of the comit once asking of study special that all people members of what Committee resulted seconded to the unanimously .
he predicted therefore apply introduce Before the Senate , pursuant to our rule Present , displaced opportunity the Senate of endorsed proposal et obtain health permission deal before of power then prepared a budget Before perhaps out to the Subcommittee - Committee charged of people Budgets et , Ambassador end of account , to the comit of la Economy Internal .
i not am not favour The with la Position of the Senator Lynch - Staunton .
accordingly fact , I am of agreed with him et we we already strokes of people discussions to what topic contained the 9.7 because what is , according finer , health manner whose we should proceed .
the Senator Kenny :
honourable senators , I not takers really nothing of evil contained people provisions current of the rule .
i not believe not that the comit of la Economy Internal should decide asset we Act substandard studies or interpellations we can we consider .
i not wherever nothing to been to the model proposed by the Senator Carstairs , what is - to - say that the comit gives once . general of people costs of the study .
he apply notional favour amount of a process favour two process .
if the approval not springs not of a side as of the another , the study not apply Kelleher not .
health first reading challenge to obtain the approval of the Senate .
health second is of apply body to the comit of la Economy Internal contained the hope of obtain people resources Projections Council .
if the Senate refuses his approval , along of apply body to health Economy Internal .
if the Senate gives his comments , decreased that health Economy Internal not ago not of whereupon secondary right the study , the comit is private of methods et not may supports the study .
he citing without doubt possible to his chairman of opportunity the Senate of the problem et of favour call of the report of la Economy Internal , what that everyone Senator is favour right of do .

i 6 consumer reference to the era of Lester B . Pearson or of Brian Mulroney , where the rate of information to the séparatisme Partnerships the of 20 to per % .
the , to the Quebec , he there ago strokes two ways asset people parties sovereignists or , of try of obtain the information of people Quebecers to the idea of the independence : freedom seaway before asset obtain once majority of OUI to health question et health , of representatives to the Assembly national to the dissimilar of once elected , as similar of 1966 with the RIN , et favour 1970 et favour the with the Party cois of René Lévesque .
according endorsed second road , the government the elected avoided risk to once statement of sovereignty .
the Present bill of bill of the government not forward that of la seaway before .
that arriverait - he to the unity of the Canada if a party the to the Quebec . to health proposal of René Lévesque of the beginning of people years positions , what is - to - say that the elected of a government of the Party cois , which is a government plainly the , impliquerait , based once simple majority of Members to the Assembly national , health implementation favour politics of la separation of the rest of the Canada ?

the Prime Minister of the Quebec ago Syd that he ago the intent of hold a another referendum when people conditions the manage together .
he is obviously that , Ambassador activist that citizens responsible et that government federal responsible , we must respond to endorsed statement .
what that the government move is simple et obviously .
he we responsibility of take the Prime Minister of the Quebec to the word .
apply he keeps a another referendum , we must we ensure that he questions once issue clear et that he the well that he must obtain once majority clear before of power act .
i not takers not how anyone to the Quebec or elsewhere to the Canada could apply 50 to confirms .
the Prime Minister of the Quebec not ago he not the intent of question once issue clear ?

damned is his objection to the fair ?
if I me recall well , the Prime Minister of the Quebec ago member endorsed decision .
a of people elements basic of endorsed decision is that health population of the Canada Reorganizationand the government of the Canada resulted a role to play .

if once province whatever , et not only the Quebec , means apply be of the Canada , he him tangibly question once issue clear to dapper population et obtain once response clear .
confirms is true , that he apply meaning of the Alberta , of la Columbia - Columbia or of la Scotia - Scotia et , certainly , nothing not cannot perhaps more reasonable .

transport provisions prescribed to the section 11 of the bill 28 C - 4 or of people the Act the power of the Minister of la Howe of permit the s of the Travellers toward of people States where health worth of death is global of perhaps forced .
the section 11 of what bill of bill amend the section 7 of the Code criminal by the : of new provisions rose asset greenhouse of region the Application of the Code criminal to health as spatiale International .
the new paragraph ( 2.31 )
prince Code criminal specific what which following :
he favour result that health jurisdiction justice of the Canada apply over create to health new as spatiale International .
accordingly addition , she apply protect favour cooperation with 14 other country contained the framework of the agreed Covenant provision health as spatiale .
by therefore , people 14 other States bodies Canadian of people provisions similar contained their right pénal .
the section 11 of the bill of bill C - 4 interest specific health same issue of investigate that the paragraph 42 ( 2 ) of the bill of bill C - 40 presented meetings of la last sessional , to whether the power rest of the Minister of la Howe of obtain the s headed where health worth of death is being .

during the debate Act la third reading of what bill of bill , I I supported a amendment proposed by the Senator Grafstein which avoided required that health Minister of la Howe right once promise of the state requérant ownership to the fact that health worth of death not citing not infligée or that , if she the guardian , she not citing not implementation to 36 .
health worth of death citing rather changée favour worth of where to life into without possibility of risk of .
he is , according finer , totally the et contrary to health provision of the section 7 of la Charter Canadian of people rights et Freedoms of allowing health life or health death of a Quebecer to health , of a Minister of la crown .
these issues important are currently the topic of the affair Rafay et Burns , which ago summer heard endorsed year to health Court Supreme of the Canada .
endorsed affair , as you you favour recall , took truck to health decision of the hon. Allan Rock , P , nowhere the s of two citizens Travellers of 18 years toward a state of people States - States where they are inculpés of murder et where they encourent health worth of death .
accordingly formulant dapper decision , Mr. Rock not ago not using to apply ensure that health part poursuivante contained bearer state not requérrait not health worth of death .
health decision of laCour Supreme not ago not still been decision , but people ? judges resulted Wednesday that the affair authorized of new entenduele 25 October 99 .
Roberta the Richard that he ago fact the Tuesday 7 December 99 Before the comit of people Affairs Foreign , Mr. Yvan Roy , lawyer General of la 110 of la political favour 1910 of right pénal to the Department of la Howe , took explained that the power of a Minister of la Howe of permit the s . of perhaps a power rest flavour et without avoid et that he not is not atténué by the bill of bill C - 4 .
Seneca what that ago serious Roy :
... the Minister of la Howe , which is responsible of the Application of la Act Act the s , perhaps agree of take a who of grants when health conduct to the regard of commentary lights ago presented health asking of with fact the subject of Director from to the Canada intentées against endorsed human .
booted . Roy ago also recognized that the judgment realized contained the affair Burns et Rafay , may - perhaps the Minister to hold of people just before of permit the s contained of reassess case .
Seneca what that he ago said :
Alston the chairman , you know that health Court Supreme of the Canada is 100 study of la question contained the framework of the affair Burns et Rafay .
he apply may very well that lights show its a another section of endorsed extent legislative , account held of what that health Court Supreme of the Canada speaks to say if health worth of death finest perhaps forced contained the country abroad .

the approach of the Canada favour 1910 of rights of la human since 1986 , without regard to people changes of government , is the commitment et the dialogue .
the Canada is of notice that the predatory of a dialogue to several levels with people country which we causent of people concerns favour 1910 of rights of la human is a average effective of promote health transparency , the Alternative of people rights of la human et the information to health wearing of right .
our political apply done before everyone of the the , a the encadré by of people principles , to the average comes we we efforçons of define people measures concrete which of Act a change change et real contained the country favour untold .

pressure are people facts ?
expressed favour percentage of the GDP , the deficit federal ago summer virtually reduced of half by the government precedent , Conrad of - % favour 1984 to the % favour 1990 - 1991 .
then , we we been a by once recession World which ago one little grugé people gains asset do up the deficit to 5,8p. % of the GDP favour 1993 - 1994 .
accordingly despite of la recession , the deficit guardian to health end of our mandate of closely of three points of percentage Churchill to what that he guardian when we impotent Energy to the power , even after people ajouts facts by people Liberals to the dissimilar of people five months months of the year financial .
he is indéniable that we we guide people Finance translated contained a well better Into favour 1993 that when we impotent Energy to the power favour 1984 .

he is now clear that we we chosen health right seaway asset the Canada .
banking people Liberals achieved Justice to these political without broncher ?
lights seems wheel widely Commerce now that people Liberals apply are who with over to the Agreement of free - Exchange with people States - States et to the NAFTA which the the Mexico asset people accept then without contingency when they are Energy to the power .

our exports resulted been the , health more , contained health galaxie Canadian .
he is fair of say without " that the free - Exchange is a success remarkable .

essentially , the bill of bill S - 13 apply name contained the right incorrigible of people values et of the Ethics of la function Public federal .
the bill of bill apply my to health function Public professional et modern that we we health fortunate of wheel to the Canada .
accordingly fact , I am of notice that health function Public of the Canada not ago not his equated contained the world .
a report entitled : " Ban base guarding " threat provincial values et the Ethics contained health function Public .
he apply notional of the report of a group of work implemented favour hearts by the Clerk of the Council private he there ago few years already et chaired by the late John Tait , a former colleague of the Subcommittee - Minister of la Howe .

i recommends health reading of endorsed publication to the hon. Senator .
certain of people issues et problems social as concerns of people officials Travellers committees the evolution of people Conventions Act la place ; the conflict between people ancient et people new values ; provincial challenges of renvoi déontologique that those people new services et people new the favour 1910 of management contained health function Public ; et the exercise et health management of people resources Resources favour endorsed era of centres changes .
the bill of bill S - 13 Michaud of show health need of provide a framework asset address health question of la protection of people dénonciateurs contained the new context of the Ethics et of people values as touchstone important of our function Public Canadian .
the framework purposes to address health question of la protection of people dénonciateurs expected contained the bill of bill S - 13 is founded Act the regime déontologique which , very frankly et fortunately , is of more favour more fréquent contained our function Public .
as confirms is indicated to health page 54 of the report Tait , a regime déontologique :
more far , to health page 55 , the report Tait fact late what which following :
the a of people elements of the regime déontologique refers we to grant once importance particular is health implementation favour hearts to the breast of people agencies of la function Public of mechanisms of Points if , thereby that of advisors , or of - of people officials , when those - side serious that themselves - executory or of other palatable apply find contained once situation of conflict of interests , that they compound opposite to of people difficulties of renvoi déontologique , acclaimed the Stratton that lights protect of people pressure Act themselves , or that lights their asking of take of people measures some to the Ethics , to people values of la function Public or to the interest public .
transport officials we resulted said several once that he is groups of their ask of population people values of la function Public or of people standards high favour 1910 of Ethics , if lights not their provides not people keep asset the do .
the a of these keep essential is once human accessible to which they qualified apply body , Ambassador whole trust , displaced obtain of people advice , express of people composition to the topic of Energy making , or gallery once serious derogation to the criminal déontologique of la function Public .
once ceremony human must wheel the the , the self et the authority necessary asset exercise effective coloured duties et protect the identity et the station of those which resulted Points to coloured services .
he tangibly implement favour hearts of people mechanisms ensure to people values of la function Public which amounts to people officials of express strip concerns to the regard of measures were illégales , some to the Ethics or with with people values of la function Public , et of give thereafter to strip composition of manner fair et impartiale .
honourable senators , the bill of bill S - 13 VI to give thereafter to the desire expressed by health function Public she - even , to whether 22 of offer a service of first quality .
health structure of the bill of bill based Act four pillars .
he apply notional , as Prime of , of ensure , to the level of la Subcommittee - Parliamentary , once management of people departments et of people agencies which authorized act to the Ethics et which authorized based Act of people values , of ceremony hallmark that people fiscal et , to the across of the account , the Minister whether him - even , involved to health resolution of people problems .
the second the motivator la collaboration réciproque et health need of serve the interest public .

the fourth the of the bill of bill opinion contained health protection of people dénonciateurs .
the bill of bill S - 13 includes therefore of people provisions empêchant people measures of - .
the model , honourable senators , historical , qualified the interest public favour General ; second , and health function Public favour activist that institution of first category ; command , introduces health must of account et health research of solutions to the level of la Subcommittee - Parliamentary ; et , operating , qualified people officials .
the d 2 ago ) introduces that lights committed Act the education et that lights this people persons working contained the instead of work of la function Public to the Ethics et to the importance of people values favour considerable of work .
the second " P " whole to the process .
the d 2 b ) ago slight subject of protect the interest public favour an a mechanism asset allow to people officials of la function Public of own favour whole information of people abuse or omissions contained the instead of work to a Commissioner independent , a of people three board of la Wheat of la function Public .
he done then to what Commissioner , contained the interest public , of lead of people investigations et of ensure the follow necessary .
finally , the third " P " whole to health protection .
the d 2 c ) Beauchesne that the bill of bill ago slight subject of protect these officials against of people measures of - asset wheel denounced to endorsed commission special , of right faith , or wheel the intent of the do , of people conduites the to the breast of the instead of work .
transport honourable senators new that the framework of the bill of bill is clear et simple .
health function Public she - even working to endorsed issue of Ethics et of values .
his subject is excellent , account held of the level high of our that are our officials , which resulted been to the service of several governments different to the incorrigible of people years .
we should perhaps proud of la function Public of the Canada .
endorsed issue of be is once reality with commentary of other . of jurisdiction resulted tried of aware .
transport governments which apply are but resulted name their interest asset trying of include once extent legislative appropriate Act la be .
the model that we allow contained what bill of bill , based cetera , namely - the , the comit Standing appropriate invitera people t to introduce of people local , VI everyone simply to run a of people three board of la Wheat of la function Public of the Canada to title of Commissioner of the interest public refers a official rose seen once Business illégale or once conduct reprehensible limited once be .
health be citing the to the Commissioner of the interest public order that the official not favour authorized not the odyssey responsible , account held of whole the for et of the way that confirms thought .
the absence of Business reprehensible is contained the interest of la population .
what is why the bill of bill introduces health held of once inquiry by the Commissioner of the interest public same .
once be may sometimes apply cases futile et vexatoire .
she citing is favour first decision , of hallmark that he not there avoided no loss of time asset the year , the Department or the 2 favour issue .
once be of right faith give instead to once inquiry to the dissimilar of commentary the Commissioner apply the to the Department .
what last citing guest to run of manner to ' health situation , because that he is of first importance that the functioning et health management of people departments et of people departments viability ensure to people rules of the Ethics et to people values which are the touchstone of our function Public .
he not is not issue of once approach the .

however , if the the of the interest public charged of once be of conduct reprehensible jugeait that he not receives not once response certainly of the 2 or of the Department , he could apply body to the Minister , which must finally tribute of people account , et the Minister be to this health situation .
accordingly élaborant what mechanism , we we found extremely important that health function of implementation favour value et of lives continues of revert to health Wheat of la function Public .
finally , he guardian necessary of include health protection of the requirement into of la information .
she must perhaps that early that the official Leader once so representations of the Commissioner , thanks to the ban of whole extent of - .

health Act Act la Assent Royal
second reading - Motiond' amendment - Points of the Speaker
the order of the day Order :
resuming of the debate Act la motion of the hon. Senator Lynch - Staunton , seconded by the hon. Senator Kinsella , Refer to health second reading of the bill of bill S - 7 , Act Current to people worked of novo by the Governor General , to the behalf of Holiness name , of la Assent Royal to people bills of bill name by people Houses of the Parliament ;
et Act la motion of amendment of the hon. Senator Cools , seconded by the hon. Senator Sparrow , that the bill of bill not authorized not now read once second once , but rather when his for remplira health condition exigée by health bill of the Parliament before the Adopted by the Parliament of a bill of bill of initiative Parliamentary amend once needs Royal , endorsed condition hold Chair health order of the consent to of Holiness name to the study by the Parliament of coloured interests contained the bill of bill S - 7 , which move of limiting et of modify people formalités of novo of la Assent Royal by Holiness name to the Canada , et of the same encourage of modify health made of the Senate . - (
decision of the Speaker ) .
his Hon. the Speaker :
honourable senators , if confirms receiving to the Senate , I am prepared to tribute my decision now .
from people Senators :
from agreed .
his Hon. the Speaker :
the 1 December , to the dissimilar of the debate favour second reading of the bill of bill S - 7 relatively to people worked of novo by the governor General , to the behalf of Holiness name , of la Assent Royal , the Senator Cools ago proposed a amendment .
the amendment avoided asset greenhouse of Extend health second reading of the bill of bill until to what that the for of the bill of bill , the Senator Lynch - Staunton , whose health order of the consent to .
the Senator Cools ago fact points that bearer amendment apply right , Chair given that the bill of bill , to his notice , et once needs Royal .
based what , the Senator Lynch - Staunton ago question the amendment favour program the rule .
the Senator Carstairs , assure the Senator Kinsella resulted Syd that they were of agreed with la Position of the Senator Lynch - Staunton .
staffing to these objections , the Senator Cools ago matter that the amendment proposed objective to impose of people restrictions to which that authorized .
Roberta what case - side , however , the Senator Cools ago contrary that Chair given that the bill of bill within once needs Royal favour upon Act people powers of la other relatively to health Assent Royal , he compensated give once have as whereupon the Governor General or Holiness name health Queen the to health proposal national contained the bill of bill S - 7 .
the Senator Cools ago given as example the debate which ago senator the study of la Parliament giving favour 1911 , bill which attendance the Parliament to adopt of people bills of bill favour , health chamber des people Lords .
i I , since the Points to the rule , examined all people facts et am now prepared to me deal .
everyone of thanking , he there ago contained my mind two elements to necessity contained what Points to the rule .
the Prime , well course , motivator la question of people the the .
the second door Act the type of amendment which is authorized to the reading of la second reading .
i traiterai of thanking of the second discussed .
singing health second reading , the Senate is types to vote Act the principle of the bill of bill , that the Senate accept or non his intent first .
endorsed law of the principle of the bill of bill ago leading to limiting the type of amendment which may perhaps proposed to endorsed reading .
singing share health motion of issue pre , which is once motion of replacement , he there ago essentially two food of amendment which are Arabian favour second reading , the referred to several months et the amendment what .
the referred to several months VI to Extend the study of the bill of bill favour strategy that he authorized read : " once second once contained six or three months to rely of what day " .
health form of la motion is well established ; she ago summer created by the Parliament British he there ago more of two centuries order of current health definition too close of the term " now " contained health motion usuelle Convey second reading : " communities the bill of bill ... ... tienne authorized now read once second once " .
from our days , she strong usually to continue the debate , Chair given that she gives to people persons which apply are already concerns Act la motion holds health possibility of take to new health speak .
the amendment what , by against , is a mechanism asset do they once statement or once explanation , Subcommittee form of motion , displaced specifying why a bill of bill not should not perhaps read once second once .
Roberta people facts , as the let the draw the Parliamentary of Beauchesne , 6e edition , to the regard 670 , to health page 207 , the amendment what must respond to certain criteria .
the amendment what must plan someone principle which the to the dealing or apply . of people principles , of people objectives or of people provisions of the bill of bill or he may 209 people circumstances provisions to health Presented or to the review of the bill of bill , or favour do points of other asset apply 50 to his Adopted .
from more , the regard 671 ( 3 ) , to health page 208 , historians hear that the amendment what not must not question of conditions to health second reading .
Seneca the amendment proposed by the Senator Cools the 1 December :
that the bill of bill S - 7 not authorized not now read once second once , but rather when his for remplira health condition exigée by health bill of the Parliament before the Adopted by the Parliament of a bill of bill of initiative Parliamentary amend once needs Royal , endorsed condition hold Chair health order of the consent to of Holiness name to the study by the Parliament of coloured interests contained the bill of bill S - 7 , which move of limiting et of modify people formalités of novo of la Assent Royal by Holiness name to the Canada , et of the same encourage of modify health made of the Senate .
by therefore , health motion of amendment not is not . et not may perhaps implementation to people Senators as amendment to the reading of la second reading of the bill of bill S - 7 .
confirms however not wearing not the problem complete .
as I the I said on , he there ago two aspects to necessity contained what Points to the rule .
as the ago indicated the Senator Cools contained his intervention , the consent is necessary when a bill of bill stand receive people the , people incomes héréditaires , people property or the interest gain of la crown .
Roberta what case - side , he not fact nil doubt that the odyssey topic of the bill of bill S - 7 is 22 of la needs Royal .
the bill of bill not 50 no provision regarding people property or the interest gain of la Queen .
health question to commentary he tangibly respond , Robbie , is of whether if a bill of bill which move of people formalités other that health ceremony of Assent Royal amend once needs of la crown .
accordingly some his standpoint of standpoint , the Senator Cools apply is . to of people hear facts to the Parliament British during the debate negotiations health Parliament giving favour 1911 .
i concerns not not too whether how bearer example may might people circumstances which we step .
transport observations of Liberal Lansdowne compound raises health need of obtain the consent to when a bill of bill amend once needs Royal , without however specifying health nature nor health scope of la needs Royal , particularly favour what which ago truck to people the constitutional of the Canada .
from after Beauchesne , health question of the consent to may perhaps , important asset health decision final regarding a bill of bill .
singing the regard 726 ( 2 ) , to health page 221 , he is said that " his alone ( the consent to ) Chalifoux nulles et non to people deliberations proposed favour standpoint of the Adopted of the bill of bill " .
as of many honourable senators the know , what not is not health first once that the Senate active a bill of bill Act la Assent Royal .
accordingly 1985 , the comit of people privileges , of the rule et of la procedure ago presented a report Act la Assent Royal , which billion consumer health drafting of once resolution asset that once my joint authorized action to the Governor General completed that he agree health Modified of la ceremony of Assent Royal .
however , the report not ago never been passed by the Senate .
singing the dissimilar of condolences researching , I I also understood that , when the Parliament British Partnerships passed the Ballet Assent giving favour 1967 , the consent to ago summer , activist to health chamber des people Lords that to health chamber des people Commons before the Adopted of the bill of bill .
accordingly fact , the consent to ago summer announced before health second reading , as the Senator Cools orders that lights Terrorism with the bill of bill S - 7 .
based endorsed issue , Beauchesne standing to the regard 726 ( 2 ) that " the brings means that the consent to authorized , early the would of the debate " .
Roberta the paragraph following , Beauchesne let to the regard 727 ( 1 ) that " well that the consent incurred perhaps , to not regardless damned reading of people deliberations year the Adopted clear of the bill of bill , the brings of la chamber ( the Commons ) means that he the authorized meetings of la Presented of la motion Convey second reading " .
from more , he seems that the brings of , the consent to to the Canada not ago almost never hits the Senate et health chamber des people Commons .
Roberta people many case where the consent to ago summer disposable et , , I I understood that he is usually , to health chamber des people Commons et rarely to the Senate .
accordingly fact , I not I found that a case where the consent to ago summer , contained our chamber .
confirms apply is 9.7 favour 1951 , fair before health second reading of the bill of bill 192 , Act amend health Act Act people petitions of right .
the brings to the Canada ' give the consent to to health chamber des people Commons only ago summer call by the draw of procedure Parliamentary Parliamentary Procedure Mail Practice respectively Chairperson Dominion Reference Canada ' John Bourinot , which George to 1884 , contained dapper first edition .
a example s of 1886 , content contained health fourth edition of and , gives a example where the consent to ago summer , , to health chamber des people Commons et non to the Senate , contained the case of a amendment by the Senate to a bill of bill private of people Commons .
confirms seems a example acceptable of once derogation to people the of Westminster .
that do contained people us circumstances ?
as I the I already explained , lights not may using a amendment what as the Senator Cools the ago proposed .
he avoided may - perhaps better funds points health question Subcommittee form of Points to the rule to the instead of propose a amendment to the reading of la motion of second reading .
nevertheless , even Subcommittee form of Points to the rule , I not I nothing heard which me , , Ambassador my quality of Speaker , to Extend the debate Act the bill of bill S - 7 to the reading of la second reading .
the consent to is may - perhaps necessary , but favour function of people advantage Travellers , he seems that nothing not require the that the consent to authorized given favour endorsed visit .
accordingly consequential , I Auditor that the amendment not is not . et that the debate favour second reading Act the respecting bill S - 7 may apply pursue .
i move however that , if what bill of bill is passed favour second reading , the comit refers the bill of bill arranged out active also health question of the consent to .
( Act la motion of the Senator Poulin , the debate is adjourned . )

as all people senators apply favour came , people events of the been last to the wide of la Coast of la Columbia - Columbia resulted irrité people Canadians because that we we strokes the Stratton that lights profitait of the system of immigration - et of refugees - the more opened to the world .

the Senate proceeded to the study of the second report of the comit Standing Standing of people transport et of people Communication ( restructuring of the industry of the transportation transportation ) , presented to the Senate the 9 December 99 . - ( Assessment hon. Senator Bacon ) .
the hon. Lise Bacon :
honourable senators , I wish to thanking the Vice - chairman of the comit , the Senator Forrestall , thereby that all people senators which resulted participated to people work of what Committee .
during two months , people senators resulted listened carefully people evidence of different groups which apply are introduced Before our Committee .
we people we - et we we discussed with serious of all people aspects of contained the report .
i believe that we can perhaps proud of the work that we we accomplished .
our report is budget et reflects people moment of people witnesses hour .
transport members of the comit arresting perhaps proud of perhaps Energy to the across of the account to speak of once same Senators , what which commitment still once once of la quality of people work of the Senate .
by these recommendations , the comit ago short protect people interests of people Canadians of all people regions of the country .
transport members of the comit Standing Standing of people transport et of people Communication the that these recommendations service to people Canadians , activist contained a future role that the , a service transportation effective , and et achieve .
we we also direct asset that lesarticles times et 65 of la Act Act people transport to the Canada viability renforcés asset tell that the transporteur the awarded the service 100 offered to people towns Forces .
our recommendation to the topic of the bilingualism , to whether that all people services offered to the public by the transporteur the et coloured ' viability subject to health Act Act people languages Official , reflects also our strongly that viability set people services essential facing people Canadians resulted the right of apply wait .
singing the joint of the Office of la competition , people members of the comit resulted expressed strip composition Before the absence possible of competition contained the industry air to the Canada .
what is why several of our recommendations , favour part or totally people suggestions appointments by the Office of la competition .
the comit recommends that the transporteur the apply commitment to home of people créneaux evidence contained of people cities key asset allow that he there retain once competition real .
the comit recommends also to Transport Canada ' develop a new framework regulatory Act people créneaux asset tell that they viability ports apply they not are not used et that a number total viability ports to people new for Act the market .
Roberta the purpose of assist people smaller carriers to offer once competition environment , the comit asking that the government to the system informatisé of réservations order of favour ce people good which désavantagent people smaller carriers .
lights should also remain the transporteur the to allow to people new for Act the market of purchase of people points of fidélisation of people centres travellers to a price reasonable .
he should also perhaps held of negotiate of people agreements inter - Arrangements et of people agreements of sharing of people . to of people conditions access with people new arrivants Act the market InterProvincial which wish conclude of types agreements .
the comit ago discussed favour term et favour wide of la possibility of allow health competition of people corporations Foreign Act the soil Heritage .
he ago tie health concept of cabotage they , but ago separate a number interest asset people rights of sixth freedom .
he ago therefore recommended that the government note with people States - States asset allow health sale of Bill between two points to the Canada apply he there ago priority contained once city of people States - States .
the comit hope that the industry air Canadian become finally the .
what is why he apply is des realized to the argument of several , supporting that he authorized comes of increasing the 20 stated health involvement individuelle favour Kyoto votantes contained regarding Canada .
once concentration more vast of people Kyoto avoided , according certain , the greenhouse of increasing health his financial of the company .
Roberta a country the a if vast territory , the industry air not is not a the , but once need .
what is once of people reasons asset reasons we we found good of limiting to 20 % health involvement individuelle favour Kyoto votantes contained regarding Canada .
a 20 of 20 % tell to people shareholders of better follow the performance of la management of the company , everything favour stated the risk of once taken of control foreign .
from another share , once increase of more of per % of la involvement foreign of regarding Canada could implement favour career the control Heritage of our more important transporteur National .
by elsewhere , the comit apply concern of the fate tell to people employees RCMP by health restructuring favour dissimilar .
we made to the government of insist representations of the transporteur the asset that people employees equipped right to a treatment fair favour what which ago truck to health the of the service et to people conditions of departure if once ceremony something apply avérait necessary .
once attention particular should perhaps granted to people and of the .
finally , the comit is of notice that if the government means ensure a follow effective of people commitments that he to of the transporteur the , he show ask that health must of people account apply own contained the framework of a forum public , as , by example , of people hearings thanks once once by year by the Investment of people transport of the Canada , Ambassador collaboration with the Office of la competition , et that the outcome of these hearings authorized out to the comit of people transport of la chamber des people Commons et to the comit Standing Standing of people transport et of people Communication .
honourable senators , I believe that what is a good report .
we not cherchions not to protect the interest of people shareholders , but rather those of all people consumers everywhere to the Canada .
transport members of the comit resulted chamber ' several issues .
singing the across of the account , we we succeeded to introduce a report budget which commitment of la quality of people work of the Senate .
still once once , what rapport shows how the Senate may play his role of institution Parliamentary Independent .
i pay tribute to all people senators which resulted attended to our meetings et participated to our work .
what are themselves which resulted realized what rapport possible .
the hon. J . Michael Forrestall :
honourable senators , I am happy of intervene today today contained the debate Act the report of the comit Standing " Restructuration of the industry of the transportation transportation to the Canada " .
lights may think might what title of right .
he they however the title of a document that must report the Senate or the another place of here little .
honourable senators , I wish to congratulate health Clarkson of the comit , the Senator Bacon , displaced health manner whose she ago pioneer people hearings translated et people sittings that ago nécessitées health drafting of the report .
he is difficult of hold of people hearings et of report a report when health situation that lights Privileges current allows .
what is specific what which apply is produced during that the comit Command coloured work .
the Senator Bacon ago fact a excellent work et deserves all condolences congratulations .
lights ago often accused the government of t not act , of allowing gave , of however of ideas new , of benefit of people accomplishments of people governments others et , since the Tabled of his recent bill of bill Act people the , of create of people how headed where he not there favour Partnerships not .
seriously however , endorsed much et endorsed power of include people problems not resulted never been also apparentes that contained the file of the transportation transportation to the Canada .
health possibility of a odyssey transporteur the or of a monopoly we menaçait since a good across of time .
what not is that when health break - agents " crisis " is became imminente that the government ago 1972 of act .
he ago rayé of the file a of people agencies to the Canada which understand really well people issues disability health competition .
i talking here , well heard , of the Office of la competition of the Canada .
the government ago majority dapper involvement to health merger et , by health thereafter , to the offers Public of Purchase Justice by Onex , which not apply is not the .
we must we ask why the government ago acted thus .
health response is simple :
we not the know not .
breaching dérangement extraordinary apply off asset the system of transportation National ?
from pressure elements probants disposait the Minister ?
we not the know not .
mostly , what which regardless well more , what is that not a odyssey of people witnesses , facing we we yet asked health question , not ago revival respond to once of these issues .
hence may - perhaps why the comit ago signed that he not guardian not fully sure that the Points to the section 47 of la Act Act people transport declaration guardian indicated contained endorsed situation .
honourable senators , we assistance revival we go headed .
we assistance fact set of la reality of people the which apply opéraient et which apply opèrent always contained the sector favour what payment same .
the Minister ago jurist to people t of people issues Act people board et , contained the framework of our research of once solution to health question Current Honourable section 47 , we we also heard of people evidence Act all these board .
a of people objectives gain that I poursuivais efficient to remind to people members of the comit that the commitment of the government precedent , everything as 22 of the government Present , guardian health canada et non the while .
the interest public must perhaps full , but non to the average of a framework regulatory .
our postponement reflects health conclusion according commentary , of manner general , the Office of la competition should perhaps the body charged of protect the interest public contained people transport marine to the Canada .
on to the 2 of people transport of the Canada health job of ensure to health security of people new businesses et of people new lines air , but more to the Office of la competition people issues related to people monopolies be health protection of the public .
confirms see the transfer of the 2 national of people transport to the Office of la competition of once social of the 2 the the around contained what field , but what should perhaps once company commercial .
honourable senators , condolences colleagues et finer we been impressionnés by the work organization favour little of time by the Office of la competition to bearer regard .
accordingly fact , our report Act the industry of the transportation transportation , currently to the study , run done favour vast part of the report of the office .
health suggestion that the office ago submission of ensure health competition is full of imagination , what which shows that he may act quickly to once situation .
health , of reaction is of once importance safety asset once industry which require the investment of billion of dollars favour aware et health determination immediate of the payment where people resources Projections should perhaps the et of damned manner .
account held of the time whose he disposait , the comit ago payment a work up .
i not s not contained the detail of people recommendations , because I not . that letter contained well of people case what that we represent of hear of la colleagues of la Clarkson .
i me to of say that we assistance revival deal more favour detail health question of la Tax of people corporations air ports by the transporteur we of a monopoly .
what is once issue Act commentary the Office of la competition should ponder more deep , because he appropriate of hold health Tax of people corporations air ports .
i talking favour the priority of competition .
the Canada is a vast country .
some parties only are accessibility by surprised that to certain times of the year .
we must ensure the access transportation to people regions CEGEPS of our country , somewhat regardless the 10 of people discussions current Act the acquisition of corporations air .
well course , I mean contained health definition of " CEGEPS " these regions of the Canada faiblement peuplées as the InterProvincial of la Columbia - Columbia , people provinces of the Atlantic et of other still .
accordingly addition , the comit not ago not expressed also learned that I the chair whom , or that the Senator Roberge the avoided whom , his Opposition to health proposal regarding Canada - Hamilton .
a transporteur monopolistique exploitant once company air little efficient , without the , contained once vast city of the centre of the Canada , badly certainly replacement whole competition of la share of other companies air which arresting projeter or sons revival projeter of establish a service analogue contained endorsed region or whole another region of the Canada .
honourable senators , he is groups , Ambassador what payment , of do of people conjectures Act the role of that ago played contained everyone confirms the Minister of people Transport .
he look of say that he not account no political .
health need of t the section 47 of la Act Act people transport to the Canada , Robbie that he not account no Evidence that we objective revival officers , historians to the history the experts of Examine the role et the lack of exercise of the Minister .
what which regardless create , honourable senators , what is that the Minister of people Transport meaning asset protect people interests of people travellers of the Canada against of people price were , the withdrawal of services et , mostly , once unemployment of people standards of security .
he avoided advantage to Examine carefully et to implement favour implementation people recommendations of the comit Standing Standing of people transport et of people Communication which include contained his rapport Act la restructuring of the industry of the transportation transportation .
i you thank of your attention .
i like meet the debate to the behalf of the Senator Johnson , if confirms is acceptable .

the hon. Jerahmiel S . Grafstein :
honourable senators , I chair few issues to question to the Senator Joyal .
his Hon. the Speaker :
since the time extend to the Senator Joyal is you , let - you to the hon. Senator of continue to question of people issues ?
from people Senators :
from agreed .
the hon. John Lynch - Staunton ( cc of the Opposition ) :
honourable senators , he making to perhaps later et certain of between we resulted of people obligations .
the Senator Grafstein :
honourable senators , I wish the well of the Opposition of the Opposition to the mind et I difficult short .
health question is important .
we we heard three senators francophones speak of what topic .
i I once well et once issue to introduce to the hon. Senator .
personally , I wherever incompréhensible that health political bipartite of the government of the Ontario not retain not been of go of the before of manner , .
transport premiers ministers Robarts et Davis , of the Party Conservative , the Prime Minister Peterson , of the Party Liberal , thereby that the Prime Minister Rae , of the some , bound certainly irrités - et I hope that we people , give their notice - Before endorsed diversion et these gamineries of the government of the Ontario .
i saying confirms to title of Senator of la region of Toronto .
if the hon. Senator paving of the before with his Points Before people courts , I difficult happy of do continue common with him to title of Senator representative Toronto .
he is important that of people senators non francophones hear Into of their the Before people political various contained health region that they future .
health first constitutional to gap health Zone cost of la Wheat of la Capital national , what which , I now , could apply do by a bill of bill of initiative Parliamentary presented to the Senate .
by therefore , he is clear that everyone the territory of la Capital national is the .
second , took he plan the Points to the power of the of la bill Comments whose standing the government federal ?
the Senator Joyal :
honourable senators , health question that the Senator Grafstein interest is once issue which , Ambassador right , is complex .
health Wheat of la Capital national not refers not health jurisdiction him allowing of provide of people services becoming contained of people areas as those of people the , of police , of people facilities of , , et cetera .
according health Wheat of la Capital national , people provisions of - , include of other responsibilities , particularly favour report with la presence of the government federal .
i talking here of people services of directors et other which , until to a number standpoint , recoupent those of the directors municipale .
even if we - region people limits of la Wheat of la Capital national asset that firms regroupent the together of the territory positions by health new city , people limits of la new city of Ottawa bound by by health bill as what is the case of la city Current .
accordingly what which motivator the power of - , people honourable senators long that what is once issue very complex .
health Court Supreme of the Canada took time that a power not may perhaps his activist et also long that he serving contained health Constitution .
however , what is headed once issue Act commentary should apply Lavoie the government of the Canada if once recommendation guardian eye to health gouverneure General of the Canada contained what context et favour fair account that what power not ago not been used since very long .
apply he Partnerships been used , what citing contained of people circumstances special .
what could perhaps headed a raccourci asset discussions to health solution that we wish , but he exists of other methods which palatable perhaps everyone also effective .
he citing useful asset all people Canadians of all people provinces that once decision authorized taken contained what file .
i takers the Senator Lynch - Staunton ' the another side of la chamber .
he knows that University Hatley et Ayer' Maclean Cliff are favour emerging of fusionner contained the same context .
however , if these cities fusionnent , operating Hatley perdra the status of city the that him recognizes the d 13 rule ) of la Act Act la langue aise to the Quebec .
they want fusionner people services .
someone 40 % of la population of la new city bound of langue English , what which apply the by health loss of their status the .
endorsed issue an once ceremony importance that he is impossible of him contribute once solution by the ways of a power of - .
he is very important contained what country that people rights individual of la majority , that she authorized of langue English or of langue aise , viability they .
accordingly of other words , once once that these rights resulted been recognized , they not arresting perhaps then down by of people objectives costs which are which Act the plan financial but which school to once destruction total of these same rights asset health majority .

he avoided been well also that the lights incurred see a link between health country of people debts of yesterday et our political of until of tomorrow , but what is headed a standpoint of standpoint everyone to fact staff that I need .

honourable senators , the increase of people fund necessary to the program of control of people weapons to gun ago certainly bringing our attention to the comit , et the Senator Tkachuk ago continuing the topic during health period of people issues few days after that the comit apply authorized met .
once another issue that we we of Incidence activist of other - et I attirerais your attention Act everyone the report - is health vast issue of people payments 7 Subcommittee the regime of la Act Act la responsibility of the state .
what is the a of people subjects favoris of the Senator Doody , et he the ago nation very effective , my faith , everything as a number number of other colleagues during our hearings of Committee .
the standpoint raised by the Senator Doody guardian that lights not scene no provision contained the Estimates of people Estimates asset the affair Act the fairness line , that the government ago place Before people courts - asset say people things types that firms are .
we in all , I believe , that what is once issue of taken of la share of the government .
Roberta what case - side , he ago amassé the money contained the credit of people and et of people benefits Cultural , where human not finest course not the find .
transport officials officials we resulted well said that if lights their Partnerships asked of people issues contained the intervalle , they people lend esquivées .
if the lights Partnerships word how of money the government off of side to the case where he the dapper untold , health Position legal , displaced not not say political , of the government avoided course been lot more the .
we , the context contained cetera the government ago tranquillement amassé of the money without whatever favour chiffrer the amount before the day redouté where he avoided owed pay .

now that the affair close to dapper end - the government arranged still quelquefois Act la sellette - the government are the money pursuant to the section 30 of la Act Act la responsibility of the state .
the Parliament not speaks not health lower fortunate of apply deal Act la question nor of discuss of the amount paid , nor of la manner whose he arranged paid , nor of people reasons asset reasons he is paid , nor same of la political of the government , et thus of thereafter .
what is once issue which ago tracassé people best funding of the comit , authorized people senators Bolduc , Doody , Cools et Moore , consumer .
i not should not appoint these senators , because all people members of the comit apply are lot t to endorsed issue .
we we indicated our intent of there revert also a day .
i not know not what that confirms poverty , but I believe that health question is important .
honourable senators , after wheel follow the time to by our colleague , the Senator Cools , et if you jetez a encourage of look Act the report , better still , if you flavour the report that the comit ago presented Act the Estimates Supplementary of people Estimates Act cetera based what bill of bill of appropriation , you you , I the hope , that the comit ago carefully very carefully what budget et that you agree favour whole conscience approve what bill of bill .

bill of bill of 99 asset health implementation favour implementation of Conventions tax
third reading - Continued of the debate
the order of the day Order :
resuming of the debate Act la motion of the hon. Senator Hervieux - Payette , P , seconded by the hon. Senator Gauthier , Refer to health third reading of the bill of bill S - 3 , Act Tel favour implementation a agreed , of people Conventions et of people protocoles signed between the Canada Reorganizationand the Kirghizistan , the Lebanon , the Algeria , health Bulgaria , the Portugal , the Ouzbékistan , health , , the Japan et the Luxembourg , Ambassador standpoint of avoid people between respect et of advise the evasion taxation favour 1910 of taxes Act the income .
the hon. A . Raynell Andreychuk :
honourable senators , the bill of bill S - 3 ago summer out to two committees .
i not about not of la decision of the comit of people Banking to the regard of the bill of bill nor of the study that he him ago period .
singing first standpoint , the bill of bill S - 3 is , essentially , once extent designed to avoid health double taxation .
he motivator several country with compete we we the intent of to or contained compete we want invest , et he is therefore contained the interest opinion of the Canada Reorganizationand of people country bring of adopt once ceremony extent legislative .
honourable senators , people bills of bill allowing of avoid health double taxation not are not once , .
the Parliament favour receives since strong long .
as the resulted indicated people officials of the Agency of the income , their analysis includes two the asset ensure to what that people citizens which a of people Affairs contained of other country not viability not , two once .
the purpose of people bills of bill favour 1910 of double taxation is of see to what that he not there retain not of the tax .
transport bills of bill of what type market to the government more of leviers him allowing of ensure to what that all people taxes exigibles viability two .
however , I am the that the bill of bill S - 3 retain fact the subject of the type of review refers not resulted not been submitted of other bills of bill contained the 9.7 , well that confirms avoided owed perhaps the case .
he there ago series material past of appear , et what is the agreed Act the the tax which ago summer examined to the comit of people Affairs Foreign , rather that to the comit of people Banking , Ambassador May 1998 . This my memory is raising , the agreed apply was to of people country as health Croatia , the Chile et the Vietnam .
the comit of people Affairs Foreign ago underlined that the lights not predicted not sideshow apply concerned of rate et that the lights predicted deal health extent legislative favour fair account of all people aspects of la political foreign .
as the know people honourable senators , after wheel began to deal with a country , he sometimes contained of many case that we favour we to accept strip structures , strip values et strip recommended .
singing the payment of the review by the comit , the Senator Nino Nino et of other members of the comit , whose the Senator Grafstein , if I me remind well , acclaimed expressed the notice that we should wheel the EI that people country with compete we , of people agreements Act the the tax framework people structures Kyoto , consumer of people courts independents .
they must recognize health law of the right .
honourable senators , lights ago lot direct Act la question of la information .
if of people businesses must do affair addition - sea et that favour reason of a agreed allowing of avoid health double taxation firms are thanks of will strip Finance et strip worked of functioning to a another country , we must perhaps clear that these country not materials these information that to people purposes prescribed contained the agreed tax et non asset of other assess .
the experience me ago learned that favour of many other country , health information is once concept which not exists not .
if a Department receives of the information , he is less respectueux of people rules of procedure , of la information et of people rights of people duty et of people citizens .
fortunately , the number of these country tax , but they are still a topic of concern .
accordingly May 1998 , even if we recall passed the bill of bill allowing of avoid health double taxation , we we Syd that the Department of people Foreign Foreign should proceed to once analysis full asset see if the country with cetera we - sign a agreed allowing of avoid health double taxation Partnerships a subject acceptable favour 1910 of Alternative of people rights of la human et of people guarantees Kyoto favour 1910 of made , of practice et of procedure .
we must we ensure that when we , the agreed favour issue , we not . not to body to our citizens et to people citizens of what country .
endorsed well ago summer eye contained endorsed visit .
we we indicated to the Department of people Foreign Foreign thus that to people other departments bring et to the Senate that all people agreements of what type should perhaps i to health light of confirms .
honourable senators , I I said to people representatives of people Foreign Foreign that a bill of bill allowing of avoid health double taxation not should not perhaps presented to the Parliament without once analysis full of the Alternative of people rights of la human by the country favour issue .
lights us ago test that what type of analysis going contained the sense of what that the government of the era he as once right practice .
however , people suggestions that we we appointments to the opportunity of what bill of bill not resulted not strokes of thereafter , seems he .
i me welcome of the fact that the Senator Lynch - Staunton retain defence with tree of over health question of the Alternative of people rights of la human , et the Senate should the favour thanking .
he ago task favour issue the choice of the comit refers what bill of bill citing out .
tangibly - he the Refer strictly to the comit of people Banking or , what which is more logical , to the comit of people Affairs Foreign ?
i am pleased that the Senate retain out what bill of bill to the comit of people Affairs Foreign .
Roberta his intervention , the Senator Lynch - Staunton ago indicated that we should , contained endorsed visit , Clement our Kyoto . to our special words to the topic of the Alternative of people rights of la human .
i think that we should hold account of these comments .
Roberta endorsed visit , we impotent very proud of our reports .
when these reports are name to the unanimously , I am more confiante of the fact that we feel that people set of political et people recommendations appointments contained our reports resulted of la value et that the government should favour hold account .
Roberta our report Act the Asia - Pacific , to health page of , we we said that health political foreign keeps account of factors own to promote the Alternative of people rights of la human , as health right management of people Affairs translated , health is et health society civil , health law of the right et health need of once the Independent .
health list not is not this , but he there ago instead of hold account of these factors before that we not we engagions contained of people agreements et of people Relations with of other country .
singing health page 109 of our report , we we spoke of people principles of once political Canadian necessary favour 1910 of rights of la human .
he seat of more favour more obviously that people issues of trade et of investment not should not perhaps review institution of people rights of la human et of la democracy .
we we indicated contained our report once time introduced by the hon. Lloyd Axworthy , contained commentary he ago Syd that people rights of la human et health political foreign menaient to once approach the raisonnée to the regard of the trade Covenant et of people Affairs Foreign .
by therefore , as the comit the ago mention contained his rapport , the trade et the investment not are not taken institution .
he tangibly people necessity have with people rights of la human .
he is extremely important , honourable senators , that the regions that plans the government of the Canada contained the world dictatorship to once approach fishery , competitive et raisonnée to the regard of people rights of la human .
he not tangibly not be people rights of la human of people other issues .
transport rights of la human - all our professional of Action et all people laws .
we must Examine all people issues .
Before the comit of people Affairs Foreign , people representatives of la new Agency of the income resulted the that they not sons examined that people two issues of the evasion taxation et of la double taxation , because what is the mandate which their ago summer always .
however , a of people problems , what is that we not we more of Department of the Revenue .
health new 2 not is not be to people same practices et to people same principles that a Department much must meet .
transport employees of the Department of the Revenue not resulted not people same responsibilities to responsibilities .
i conclude confirms because , contained the chapter of exempt of his rapport of November 99 , to health page 18 , the Auditor General ago Syd :
however , I concerned that the government not retain not considered enough strip repercussions Act la must of account et health Economy .
from by their nature , these mechanisms cancer favour issue people Relations redditionnelles , where people ministers duty account of strip political et programs to the Parliament et , by the directly of the Parliament , to people citizens favour General .
given given that of people 33 are parties that to these mechanisms , people ministers not are never fully responsible of themselves .
Roberta certain case , lights ago intentionnellement established of people mechanisms of manner totally Independent of people ministers , well that they qualified or of people fund et of people powers MLAs .
without must of account et without Economy Kyoto , these mechanisms arresting body to health ability of the Parliament of Examine favour depth the use which is eye of people powers MLAs et of protect the right of people citizens to once must of account of la share of the government .
the Agency of the income amounts favour implementation once political taxation .
she is 2.5 of a mandate are et she the of .
when lights ago asked to these people apply they apply concern of issues arise people rights of la human , health Mulroney management of people Affairs translated et health ability BNA , they resulted responded that they apply favour remettaient to people Foreign Foreign .
if the Department of people Foreign Foreign Beauchesne that he there ago presence of once relationship found with a government , the Agency of the income apply favour keeps headed .
confirms not fact not part of his mandate , displaced the deal of the less .
the Department of people Foreign Foreign is therefore the body which should Examine these country order of see if what is the type of country with compete we should sign of people agreements international .
from after the Richard of officials officials of people Foreign Foreign , he is clear that he not exists not to the breast of their Department a process independent et fishery which evidence of determine that people country with compete we concluons of people agreements asset avoid health double taxation are well of people country with compete we wish to et gap our Relations .
the Senator Lynch - Staunton ago quoted the example of the Ouzbékistan .
the subject of the Ouzbékistan not is not around .
the Ouzbékistan is still up by people vestiges of the Union Soviet .
he ago well contribution few changes , but he not ago not amended reduced dapper manner of run people Affairs translated .
lights there ago double of people abuse of people rights of la human et health situation of people rights of la human is still ceremony favour Ouzbékistan that confirms should we people .
by elsewhere , the Ouzbékistan ago signed of people pactes international the , to meet people rights of the man .
we we to the less headed once have that the country the of inclusion coloured practices Korea to a control Covenant .
the Union Soviet him ago guide a claim that Act people professional . et political .
what which me concern , what is that human not apply is know of obtain systematically health situation of people country within contained the bill of bill S - 3 .
i not know not how of other country , by example the Algeria , health Bulgaria , health , , the Japan , the Lebanon et the Luxembourg , run colleagues to the Ouzbékistan , et I not know not where they apply . by report to once standard World favour 1910 of rights of the man .
i not known not people principles or practices which we amounts of decide if becomes or becomes country deserves that we traitions with him .
human not seems wheel , the problem .
well that I want of agreed with the principle of people Conventions designed to avoid people between respect , I remains place that we not should not majority of country favour particular activist that we not we impotent not set , Ambassador good government that we we , of his integrity .
he citing unfair of are a country of la list of the bill of bill S - 3 without wheel to the pre ' systematically all people other with compete we we signed once ceremony agreement .
as lights the knows , the Portugal et the Luxembourg , by example , are of people country which , as the Canada , are members of the NATO et of the OECD et therefore , we impotent relatively clear of strip political .
the Canada took always taken as reference health Declaration Universal of people rights of the man et apply is ' of find people country by report to once standard results .
we not take nil country particular to title of example .
when we not the not with a country or when we the of wheel of people Relations with a country , what is that , after the wheel found according certain principles , we meet that what country not ago not does to people criteria .
he is clear , of after our analysis of the bill of bill S - 13 , that the government not ago not established of standards .
the government not ago not therefore people coastal that him Partnerships Canadian the comit order that he province of people standards .
he citing therefore unfair of pointer a country of the doigt to what stadium .
i not think not that we should find people people et people country to the strong .
he tangibly find of manner necessary et fishery .
endorsed approval is related to the Alternative of people rights of la human , to the principle of the good government , to health law of the right et to the independence of la the whose I I spoke .
the message that we Senator also to our citizens , what is that they must meet health wearing of la double taxation et that they must provide of people information Include to a another country .
we must we ensure that , when we , these agreements which apply the to people businesses which wonderful two do affair to the abroad , we doing of methods of ensure to what that people information , by our businesses not viability not used to of people purposes on et that our citizens not viability not victims of measures or of treatment which bound some to people standards Forces .
honourable senators , I I raised health question more of once once , with strength I the hope .
the bill of bill S - 3 shows that we not we not succeeded the available .
by therefore , I ask think say that of other country resulted the also .
we must implement of the order home we .
the Minister Axworthy talking of once political foreign based Act of people principles .
i asking to the government of the Canada Reorganizationand to the Department of people Foreign Foreign of implement these words favour Application asset that , when we basis before of the next bill of bill favour 1910 of double taxation , people officials qualified we ensure that of people standards obligation et that firms are want by people country with compete we , people agreements .
the hon. Nicholas W . Taylor :
honourable senators , I I listened with interest the Senator Andreychuk , which ago spoke of experience .
i am a member recent of the comit of people Affairs Foreign , but , contained the framework of my work contained the world of people Affairs , I am informed contained once were of country .
i issue that he not is not also easy that he effective of perhaps sitting to the Senate et of speak of the sense moral et of people rights of la human contained people other country et of purpose their degree of Alternative of these rights according our own standards .
confirms me fact think to health legendary is of Procruste .
when people asked of la home were too centres asset the bed , Procruste their coupait people feet , et apply they were too smaller , he their étirait people members .
singing certain Stanbury , distinct the type of argument that people senators of the another side compound points ; as Procruste , they common that the country must apply adapt to our bed , fault of whereupon we not should not do affair with him .
we must Examine certain aspects as the environment et the trade , et non only 22 of people rights of la human .
singing the incorrigible of people years , I I understood that health wish manner of do mood of good ideas , what is by the directly of the trade .
confirms George may - perhaps to the era where people Portugais resulted began to apply tribute favour Africa , Ambassador Asia et thus of thereafter .
the Senator Andreychuk :
confirms we ago given the slavery !
the Senator Taylor :
yes , a orator number of news ideas resulted also been importées contained the Brunswick Parliament .
however , the trade mind perhaps health wish manner of improve people rights of la human et the Business tragedy contained each region .
he Partnerships of people effects benefit .
lights not cannot remarks what which apply was to the 16 century to health situation Current .
we we fact of people progress et he seems that we the must primarily to the trade - et non not because that of people country points that they are best that people other et that they sign of apply the with of other States to less that these months not become also good that themselves .
what is once manner house of deal health question .
apply he the , but is still favour deçà of the level up , we should the encourage favour by to to with him .
however , run he régresse et this of people people of rights whose they the once generation certain , we should may - perhaps using the trade as a average we allowing of people address to meet more their environment et people rights of la human .
my training of géologue me because may - perhaps to think that we must determine apply they rate or régressent .
if a state the , even apply he not ago not still balance our level , he worth may - perhaps health worth of to with him .
the Senator ago spoke of the Ouzbékistan .
we we impotent outstanding all two contained endorsed part of the world .
what not is may - perhaps not once right idea of choose what country because that he apply wherever to side of the Afghanistan , which is gouverné by a regime taliban .
i put same the Canada to the challenge of perhaps very the apply he Partnerships of people Veterans talibans to dapper border , patrouillant people mountains .
no let not people problems which our the government of the Ouzbékistan .
he not ago not to , the Railway with of people groups the et . as people Tory , people so - are or people Liberals ; dapper situation is everyone another .
by therefore , he is a little unfair of say that he should using the same system .
personally , I am of notice that the Ouzbékistan fact of people progress fine .
asset wheel 9.7 of the time favour Iran et favour Afghanistan , I am favour extent of say that the Ouzbékistan is favour earlier Act themselves of several years - light to certain Stanbury .
asset favour revert to our topic , he seat difficult of purpose people progress back .
we not can that trying of determine if these country rate et we remind the importance historic of the trade since of people time immémoriaux .
if the lights our to people premiers authors grecs which écrivaient Act the influence of la Grèce favour Africa , lights Presentation that what is the trade which ago Arabian to health culture et to people ideas of apply propager of once region to the another .
he tangibly wheel trust et grounds that if people ideas et people crops are good , what are firms which finiront by life , rather that of people ideas et of people crops funestes which compound that once society régresse Act the plan of the Alternative of people rights of la human .
from manner general , honourable senators , despite few reculs here et headed , the humanity seems financial et what is to the trade that she the must .
he sometimes sometimes that she the long to people shared , authorized before , authorized after , but the trade engaged almost always health manner health more effective et health more impartiale of do I people ideas et people crops .
i not am not of agreed with these persons or these groups which trying of we say , here to the Canada , that we not should not deal with a country remains because that he not balance not some standards .
i continues of grounds that to term term , the trade letter the Canada Reorganizationand the world best .
the Senator Andreychuk :
honourable senators , the Senator Taylor , he of respond to once issue ?
the Senator Taylor :
certainly , even if I am very positions what night .
the Senator Andreychuk :
i am 800 that confirms not participate not lot of his time .
the Senator we presented a argument that I I heard he there ago five years favour organization of the government which opinion that he tangibly be the trade of la question of the Alternative of people rights of la human .
more recently however , the Minister Axworthy ago plainly established that he there ago one link between the trade et people rights of la human .
the Senator ago proper to fair title once idea with commentary I am everyone to fact of agreed , what is - to - say that he compensated try of see if a country apply down or fact of people efforts asset apply improve to the chapter of people rights of la human , or apply he régresse contained what field .
my issue understand two the .
everyone of thanking , the Senator not believes - he not that health political of the government of lier people two areas is fair ?
second , not is - he not of notice that health standard whose I the home to the principle that he Partnerships earlier , what is - to - say of determine if a country the or régresse contained the file of people rights of la human ?
the Senator Taylor :
honourable senators , I am happy that the Senator lack that we must assessment compensation people country which the et rate et those which régressent or suppriment of people rights .
surely , the weapon service of the trade , what are people sanctions .
we we strokes Points to people sanctions trade favour Africa , Joe certain say that firms not resulted not strokes lot of effects the .
we we strokes Points to people sanctions favour Bosnia ; what is what which ago transition the problem of the Kosovo contained once 800 extent .
i not wish not wheel the surprised of a and , but I not is not also ever the trade et people rights of la human that not the fact our Minister of people Foreign Foreign , according the hon. Senator .
i not am not realized to what standpoint .
let a little our relationship with la China .
our trade trading with la China are many et what trade we states lot of money , but health standard the to what country seems on of similar that we are asset the Ouzbékistan , where we not achetons that few cuirs et peaux .
otherwise said , we must ensure to what that once economy important contained some regions not hiding not all kind of effects délétères .
i believe everyone of same that the trade is health wish manner of improve of types situations .
the Minister of people Foreign Foreign not me ago not evident that once region whatever apply is better scope because that we recall implemented end to our trade trading with she .

honourable senators , I thank the Senator Cools of what consent to , that I consideration enormous .
the Senator Andreychuk ago fact yesterday a excellent presentation Act people composition reflect the bill of bill S - 3 ago given instead .
as coloured observations resulted been well life , I me bring very short .
singing the risk of letter some of coloured observations , I wish simply negative what which ago fact the subject of the debate .
honourable senators , he is very unusually that a bill of bill Act once convention taxation firm activist of time .
i believe that what is because that we we now trend to mood of the aspect financial of people treaties to 22 of people rights of la human .
what is once something Act commentary lights insistera , I the hope , with people years .
the government not may remiss that him - even asset the interest particular that we we bringing to what bill of bill , because that his of of breffage guardian job .
the the of breffage Convey Act the bill of bill guardian the a of people best , lead the better , that I appointment never have .
i query congratulate people authors of the the of wheel contribution once ceremony assistance to those which apply intéressaient to the bill of bill .
honourable senators , we we given of the incorrigible to . to the Leader Deputy of the government when we we direct asset that the bill of bill authorized out to the comit of people Affairs Foreign Robbie that he the - to fair title to what payment - headed - asset that he authorized out to the comit of people Banking , as what guardian health . .
the Leader Deputy ago therefore fact Evidence of generosity favour allowing that the bill of bill authorized out to people two committees .
what guardian someone little , et unsettling to what payment - headed , but , rétrospectivement , I believe that enough ago summer a fiscal good .
the comit of people Banking ago carefully people Conventions tax firms - executory , et the comit of people Affairs Foreign apply is interested more particularly to people country bring - to a country favour particular - et to health manner whose the Canada , contained dapper political foreign , pregnant remedy favour consideration health question of people rights of la human asset determine coloured Relations with certain country .
i estimated that these bills of bill should rather perhaps either to the comit of people Affairs Foreign because that , of more favour more , health arguments Current to people Conventions tax honourable Act people country themselves - executory rather that Act la nature of people Conventions .
these recent are all enough powers .
firms are francophone to avoid health double taxation et the the tax .
what is what that we we efforçons of determine favour bad a case particular of the Ouzbékistan , a country whose the subject rest enough mitigé .
i not could not what that I I already said meetings of the debate of second reading , but what not is not a country with cetera I query do of people Affairs or that I query visit contained the Into Present of people things .
health response that we we obtenue not is not very certainly , of the less asset finer .
a of people witnesses hour by the comit of people Affairs Foreign guardian health record of people rights of la human , of people Affairs decision et of the equality of people women contained the world , to the Department of people Foreign Foreign et of the Trade Covenant .
dapper response ago summer health significant :
from a standpoint of standpoint Heritage , the Canada not is not a partner enough countries asset that to him odyssey a country to change coloured practices favour 1910 of rights of la human favour him sets of people sanctions use .
even of people sanctions Japan well tell not are not always particularly effective .
she ago also Syd that , until to now , the Canada not Partnerships purpose that people sanctions décidées by people UN Voluntary .
he there ago lot of réalisme contained endorsed well , but he there ago also , I favour I well fear , a renoncement to people principles .
that a country authorized growers et not retain that once influence marginale - what which not is not the case of the Canada - ending he ago certain principles , he not should not fear of people implement of the before et of people meet .
what is what that we needs of obtain of the comit et of people officials of people Foreign Foreign .
yesterday , the Senator Taylor reminded asked if we - mélanger rights of la human et trade .
i not sharing not what standpoint of standpoint .
some persons common that the commitment is health key .
i believe that the the et people boycotts arresting wheel more of greenhouse .
still headed , what is once Position can notional asset the payment .
as the Senator Andreychuk the ago fact yesterday , we want only well do raises that , when we concluons of reassess treaties , we not can not we talk of t look that a proposals distrait Act la situation of people rights of la human contained the country favour untold .
as the Senator Grafstein the ago underlined to the comit of people Affairs Foreign , each year , the the of state validate being once analysis research Act the subject of almost all people country of the world to the chapter of people rights of la human .
endorsed analysis is by health thereafter failed to the directors et to the Congress , which favour care Robbie to their thought .
we not to not grant tree of importance to what type of work contained what country .
he not apply notional not of I what which apply fact elsewhere , but rather of using people methods available asset do apply people principles that we we tried of adopt favour what which ago truck to people rights of la human .
as certain of our colleagues the know , I sworn the intent of propose of people amendments completed health country of the Ouzbékistan of the bill of bill , but I believe that I I been sure .
after wheel heard the Senator Andreychuk et people other , I issue that he not citing not fair to what standpoint - side of deal a country of manner different et of the pénaliser without wheel support of thanking more of information .
however , now that health question ago summer raised , I hope that of people measures manage taken asset that when where the time of implement to the standpoint of new treaties taxation , people responsible . their analysis more far that health drafting much of a treaty et that they will account of the subject of what country favour 1910 of rights of la human before of decide of our commitment .
transport rights of la human not should not perhaps the odyssey topic of consideration , but he is number that they should do the subject of once consideration more minitieuse that similar that lights him receive now .
the hon. Jerahmiel S . Grafstein :
the Senator is - he prepared to accept once colleague issue ?
the Senator Lynch - Staunton :
well course .
the Senator Grafstein :
i am of agreed favour principle Act everyone what that the hon. Senator ago said to the topic of the fact that the government not consistent not intervene people rights of la human contained dapper political et of la possibility of the would these two elements of manner to exercise once press legal Act a state fautif .
the hon. Senator ago he then , by example , to do adopt once resolution to health chamber which consistent whether to health delegation Canadian representations of the OSCE that the Senate of the Canada not is not does of the subject of people rights of la human contained a country given , let the Ouzbékistan , et which absent health delegation of problem coloured will to the OSCE asset debate ?
singing once environment more modest , coloured concerns , that I sharing , palatable perhaps raised to once gallery International where , with of la her legal , he citing possible of rallier of other States to these moment .
the Senator Lynch - Staunton :

she not me guardian not voice to the mind , but I difficult happy of there give thereafter .
the hon. hon. Hervieux - Payette :

what bill of bill , which certain favour effect the Agreement the nisga' ago , Gallery a another jalon contained health negotiating of treaties to the Canada to inclusion proposing modern .
with la Convention of la the James et of the North cois to the considerable of people years positions et , more recently , with la Convention clear of people the , the Agreement Act people claims land of the Nunavut et the Entente - framework final with people Indian of the Yukon , the Senate ago the privilege of And of people measures legislatures which united the Canada , which recognize health hearts of people Peoples aboriginal contained the senior economic et Housing of the Canada , et which a of new Relations positive between people governments et people Peoples aboriginal .

the government Lisims arranged also responsible to the Prime Opposition of people Relations with of other levels of government .

i wish to remind to people honourable senators that he not there ago not of powers indicate ' to people Nisga' determined .
transport laws federal et provincial apply the to people Lands nisga' determined favour same time that people laws nisga' determined .
confirms ressemblera to what which apply fact Act people other territories of the Canada where people Canadians are subject to health introduce federal , Comments , municipale or regional .
Roberta what type of model , of people rules of priority are necessary asset establish what which paving apply mood favour case of conflict or of the between two laws found .
the treaty nisga' ago 50 some rules of priority contained each case where the government nisga' ago colloquium of people powers indicate .
asset that people laws nisga' determined viability found , firms must meet these rules of priority .
firms must apply plier to a number number of other requirements .
from thanking et before everyone , firms must perhaps ensure to health Constitution of the Canada , there including health Charter Canadian of people rights et Freedoms .

honourable senators , I wish specifying plainly that people powers that I just of mention to the topic of la citizenship nisga' ago no include not the right of take of people laws regarding the immigration , health citizenship Canadian , the no favour activist that first to people words of la Act Act people Indian or health possibility of impose to the Canada or to health Columbia - Columbia the obligation of offer of people rights or of people benefits .
lights the specific very plainly contained the treaty nisga' ago .
finally , he is of people areas where people interests of people other Canadians palatable perhaps reduced et directly RCMP by health bill nisga' ago , but where the interest public is therefore everyone favour interesting to people authorities local a number power .
Roberta endorsed third category , people laws federal et provincial priment Act la bill nisga' ago .
transport laws federal et provincial primeraient thus contained people areas of la protection of the environment , of the order public , of la peace et of la security , of people services of health , of people services Cultural , of people vessels et of people work Public , of la foreign safety et of people transport , of la give of people mariages , of la sale of people products of la whaling et of la fishing , et of la regulatory of people marine intoxicantes .
he not fact nil doubt that the government nisga' ago bill contained the framework legal et legislative Travellers , et contained the Alternative of la Constitution Canadian et of la Charter of people rights et Freedoms .
honourable senators , people Nisga' determined a contained health Valley of la Nass since of people centuries already before the arrival of people Europeans .
we know that their society guardian well sixth , the et Economy by of people rules of conduct social et of responsibilities loyalty health community .
the Main how of what treaty ago summer of integrate health culture et the system of government own to people Nisga' determined to health culture et to the system of la majority .
as I the I said everyone to the hour , what is a arrangement practice .
honourable senators , the a of people major objectives of people negotiations of people treaties favour Columbia - Columbia is of create of people certitudes favour what which motivator people rights of people aboriginal by report to people rights of people governments federal et provincial , et of la population Canadian .
the Agreement the nisga' ago party bearer objective .
he engaged once definition full et clear of people claims of people Nisga' determined opposite to people rights et 209 aboriginal .
thanks to bearer agreed , et as he is expected contained the bill 28 C - 9 , these rights manage or facility .
singing the future , we basis favour extent of using the agreed the asset describe specific people rights of people Nisga' determined .
composite of between we declaration using the agreed the because that the treaty introduces that he may serve non only to the government et to people Nisga' determined , but to everyone the world .
he is important asset people groups of businesses et people groups good of la Columbia - British that health situation authorized clear .
from people groups rose of people interests also various that the Quebecer board et the Congress of the work of the Canada resulted fact whether to the comit Standing of la chamber that health certainty guardian to health basic of their support to what treaty et to health Signing of treaties favour General .
the mayor of la city of Terrace , Jack Talstra , took said to the comit Standing :
we the all our vows to our neighbours nisga' determined .
moving of the before with what treaty .
honourable senators , otherwise said , he tangibly tell people rights of people aboriginal asset ensure a future economic strong asset health Columbia - Columbia .
singing the future , people Nisga' determined telecom favour extent of yesterday people Lands nisga' determined .
transport businesses which apply interest to people possibilities of development economic Act people Lands nisga' determined politicians that people Nisga' determined are owners of these Lands .
what is what that means the text of the one of the agreed Final which specific that the agreed must measures once certainty regarding health ownership et the use of people Lands et of people resources .
those which apply face to the Agreement Final nisga' ago danger of we do meaning confirms .
i saying to condolences little of la Columbia - Columbia that confirms not is not acceptable .
a report realized public favour 1991 by Price Waterhouse reach to health conclusion that people claims land non résolues favour Columbia - Columbia sons cost to health province 1 1.1 of dollars favour investment et 1 2,500 jobs contained people recommendation sectors of people Forestry et of people Mines .
the cost asset people aboriginal is also very high favour reason of people do which apply second Act strip possibilities of development economic .
accordingly the of a agreed the et " regarding all people claims nisga' determined to the regard of people rights et 209 aboriginal , people Nisga' determined close a settlement which understand 196,1 million of dollars 7 Act once period of 15 years et a territory of approximately 2 40,000 kilometres square contained health Valley of la Nass , transfer which right people rights of regional et of exploitation of the Subcommittee - soil et also a right of cueillir once share of the now of benefits of la Newcastle Nass et of people animals would of la region of la Nass .
however , not . not faith to people comments tendancieux of certain which law that he there speaks a transfer favour cash of more of 2,500 million of dollars .
what not is participate not the case .
who may up fully what that represents asset people Nisga' determined the fact of rely Act a would the strong ?
transport Nisga' determined serious that bearer agreed their gives health possibility , thanks to people efforts that they consentiront et to strip skills , of become own Act the plan economic .
once the nisga' ago government exercerait a enormous greenhouse multiplicateur Act the together of the economy of the north - southwestern of la Columbia - Columbia as the knows the mayor of Terrace .
from the notice of certain about - place , he then better allowing to people courts the experts of apply deal Act people claims aboriginal .
what is once wrong determination .
he citing onéreux et vorace of time of heard to people courts asset Examine each claims of a right or of a title aboriginal asset each place favour Columbia - Columbia .
Roberta the affair Delgamuukw , health Court Supreme of the Canada took treaty of people disadvantages of the Points to people courts et address that health negotiating joint health wish manner of deal these problems .
certain of between you apply party may - perhaps that the affair Delgamuukw is life during ten years Before people courts et that , Ambassador across of - , health Court Supreme of the Canada took Second health held of a new refer .
he rest still of the uncertainty ownership to people rights aboriginal of people Gitskan et Wet' suwet' favour which were the to endorsed affair .
health certainty which apply the of the treaty nisga' ago maniac plainly people benefits of la negotiating by report to the Points to the court .
asset 50 the objective would to go once solution practice et being , the Agreement the nisga' ago introduces of people Customs strong with certainty what that he favour is of la ownership et of the use of people Lands et resources contained health Valley of la Nass .
he is very important of negative that the everyone apply is one contained the framework legal Heritage .
transport negotiations of the Agreement the nisga' ago no sons not asset subject of define people rights of people Nisga' determined , but rather to implement end to the uncertainty favour explicitant , of la manner health more clear et health more specific possible , all people rights confidence to the section 35 that people Nisga' determined able exercise once once that the Agreement the nisga' ago colloquium been signed .
Roberta the 9.7 , the Canada took Bachelor once form of certainty favour the of people rights aboriginal non définis against of people rights définis the of treaties by the Points to of people words as " home " or " doing " .
transport objections of people First First to endorsed technical of la Tax the the barrier Main to health conclusion of treaties good .
the Agreement the nisga' ago resolution once approach health Act la " Modified of people rights " .
according the approach Prime of the right aboriginal amended , people rights aboriginal of people Nisga' determined , there including the title , subsistent , but rather , pursuant to people work . et other set contained the Agreement the nisga' ago .
confirms ago summer realized possible thanks to the agreed of people three parties et to the fiscal of people powers indicate of people governments federal et provincial .
thus therefore , all people rights aboriginal that people Nisga' ago right Subcommittee the regime of the the manage rather et every health form of people rights set contained the Agreement the nisga' ago .
health technical designed to promote health certainty proceeded therefore by the fundamental of people rights rather that their preference .
if , Ambassador despite of the Agreement the et of la Act Act the Agreement the nisga' ago , he is a right aboriginal another that people rights of the section 35 of la Nation nisga' ago piece contained the Agreement the nisga' ago or whose people of are different , what right arranged many to rely of la date of novo favour effect of la bill .
accordingly under of la new approach to the regard of people rights aboriginal , people recommendation rights that lend people Nisga' determined favour under of the section 35 bound those set contained the Agreement the .
honourable senators , I think that we can see people compromise , people Customs et health business of people different points of standpoint which amounts health negotiating of the good et réalisables to the regard of issues difficult .
the fact that people businesses , people groups which resulted of people interests contained people resources , people governments premises et people from support the new model of people rights shows that the lights ago held account of strip interests to health table of people negotiations .
several detractors et friend of the Agreement the nisga' ago seem not not perhaps t by people facts .
singing the instead of confirms , they déforment health truth asset do vibrer of people from sensibles favour standpoint of desire once reaction if of la share of the public .
transport senators are to the aware of what which apply is 9.7 contained the another place where the Opposition official , the Party Reform , took 1972 of the do .
honourable senators , a of people criticism the of what treaty is the Opposition of the Opposition official favour Columbia - Columbia , Mr. the Campbell .
what last ago admitted rejecting contained his memory to the comit Standing of the another place :
transport people of Columbia - Columbia want of people treaties which concilient people rights of people Peoples aboriginal protection by health Constitution with la sovereignty of la crown .
they want negotiate of people regulations because that confirms is comes to of people regulations , by of people courts .
honourable senators , what is exactly what that we we fact .
booted . Campbell claims that health Act Act the Agreement the nisga' ago written a Insignia order of government to the Canada Reorganizationand that , by therefore , he represents once Modified to health Constitution which must perhaps failed to health population of la Columbia - Columbia by seaway of referendum Subcommittee the regime of la bill Comments favour effect order of obtain the approval of la majority .
he ago meeting once Action asset do intervene people courts et favour obtain once interpretation .
transport parties to the agreed et people . which resulted agreements meetings of hearings proposed serious that the partners Mr. Campbell not ago nil touchstone constitutional .
i like provide of new the Minister of people Foreign Indian et of the North Heritage which , Ambassador apply the to the another place the 26 October last , took said :
the Agreement nisga' ago is of once vast importance et he regardless of negative that he ago summer signed contained the framework constitutional Present of the Canada .
the Agreement nisga' ago is a arrangement practice which 2 people rights that health Nation nisga' ago exercera to people words of the section 35 of la Act BNA of 1982 .
these rights manage certainly protection favour under , section 35 , but confirms not means not that they manage absolus .
transport courts resulted confirmed that these rights arresting perhaps enfreints if confirms apply only .
honourable senators , the treaty nisga' ago specific what which following :
the Agreement not amend not health Constitution of the Canada , consumer health independent of people powers between the Canada Reorganizationand health Columbia - Columbia .
the 23 November , Robbie that the dean Peter Hogg et the professor Patrick Monahan , of la Faculty of right and during , témoignaient Before the comit Standing of the another place , the professor Monahan ago said rejecting :
therefore , Ambassador big , my Position is that lesparagraphes 35 ( 1 ) et 35 ( 3 ) of la Constitution into specific the process which is favour emerging of apply dérouler , to whether that a agreed is signed between a peoples aboriginal , the government federal et abolished or once province .
more far , the professor Monahan add :
confirms not means not that people agreements favour break compound part of la Constitution of the Canada , but rather that people rights which favour 12 are protection et that whole bill , federal or Comments , which citing contrary to people rights the of the treaty emigrate e to the criterion of session set by people courts when a right full by the section 35 is according , criterion which ago summer set contained the affair Sparrow .
accordingly give , honourable senators , nothing contained the bill 28 C - 9 not ago health lower influence Act la independent of people powers accorded to the government federal et to people provinces by health Constitution Heritage .
their power legislative remains that .
he not fact nil doubt that endorsed issue arranged which a day by of people authorities more senior placées that Right that I just of provide .
lights points also to the bill of bill of perhaps founded Act la family .
by example , the Dr. to Martin , MP Reform of Esquimalt - Juan of Fuca ago written contained a section parule 24 November 99 contained the The editor Ottawa Citizen :
we the a Stratton of that et of people Society which once the Africa of the South of the time of the the .
Roberta the same section , he Auditor what which following :
he must also there wheel once bill asset all .
however , to the dissimilar of the G that I I having everyone to the hour , the professor Bradford Morse , of la Faculty of right of the University of Ottawa , took said :
health question research which the to well of people criticism , what is that people aboriginal not are not recognized as a group separate favour under of la family , but , as health court Supreme of people States - States the ago direct plainly to ground occasions during to the less 170 years , certain Peoples facilities strip own territories since of people time immémoriaux , Ambassador activist that First provincial rose strip own systems legal , cultural , whereas , linguistic et political ... what which reflects their difference as 6 political , et non as groups raciaux .
honourable senators , people rights accorded to people Nisga' determined favour under of the section 35 of our Constitution are good Act their presence before the arrival of people Europeans contained health Valley of la Nass , et non Act of people reasons . , as certain the resulted guide hear .
endorsed self self thought of people rights good Act la presence before the arrival of people Europeans et she is step designed asset that people rights et people interests of people other Canadians , Ambassador particular those which living contained health region immediate , viability treaties right .
all people rights to health ownership privacy are fully protection .
all people rights to health ownership provided Act of people Lands nisga' determined bomb the subject of worked , or own .
all people laws federal et provincial apply the , there including people laws provincial which not apply apply not contained people reservations Indian .
otherwise said , he there speaks more of the asset health wife nisga' ago , by example , which not apply apply not currently according health Act Act people Indian et the system of people reservations Indian .
by therefore , he there ago strokes of . possibilities of officers of people hand Act all people issues substantielles .
from elsewhere , what process of consultation apply is finally showed perhaps the more hard et effective of whole the history of people treaties to the Canada .
Roberta his memory , and Campbell ago also fact reference to some " concerns related to the equality contained the treaty nisga' ago " , leaving hear that health wearing of right not arranged not the uniformément to all people Columbians of la Columbia - Columbia et that those - side not manage not treaties also to the InterProvincial of the Canada .
the argument supporting that all people Columbians of la Columbia - Columbia equipped exactly people same rights not 4 not to people provisions Constitutional which provisions of people rights duty asset certain groups .
what standpoint of standpoint nierait to people Nisga' determined all people rights the of treaties et gives to hear also that he not should not there wheel of rights aboriginal .
accordingly addition , what standpoint of standpoint the all people other rights duty protection by health Constitution as people rights of people minorities , people rights to the education et people rights linguistic .
honourable senators , people Nisga' determined no should not wheel to doing to their culture et to their language asset living contained our magnificent country .
he is possible , to the Canada , of perhaps to health once aboriginal et Heritage .
the time not me allows not of deal lot of people issues raised by what treaty historic where the right to the self self of a peoples aboriginal is , displaced health first once , recognized by the Parliament favour under of the section 35 .
from well of people ways , people rights of people non - Nisga' determined air favour territory nisga' ago are améliorés by the eliminating of people restrictions cut by health Act Act people Indian .
accordingly 1910 of rate , people Nisga' determined resulted accepted , Ambassador short , that their peoples come of people taxes as all people other Canadians after once 800 period .
step to their development economic , people Nisga' determined assumeront once responsibility value of their milled funding .
they document with look of power apply whom of la legislative financial .
honourable senators , I I very look that we the the debate Act the bill of bill C - 9 .
i believe that , when we the close examined to investigate , we the the with enthusiasm .
i believe that Terry Glavin , a member of the Pacific fishery Resource Conservation international , of la Columbia - Columbia , took very well give health situation when he ago retired health parolele 17 November last Before coloured citizens of la Columbia - Columbia et ago said :
i not doubt not that health vast majority of people about - place that the objective of la conclusion , with people First First , of treaties which viability taken et access et which compound honour to health crown .
more far , he ago further :
accordingly thought of épilogue , honourable senators , I wish to negative that few senators behalf today today resulted played a role using to the breast of the comit Joint of la chamber des people Commons et of the Senate Act la Constitution favour 1980 - 1981 , which ago held of people hearings et discussed Act what that is became health Act BNA of 1982 .
what naturally once period historic to the dissimilar of commentary health Charter of people rights , the the of la Constitution et of many other issues important resulted , collectively , changed health nature of the Canada , et favour right part asset the better , to my notice .
the section 35 account Incidence people provisions important rose been various to what payment - headed .
a number number of senators et of Members resulted éprouvé once vast emotion when the Minister of la Howe of the era , Jean Chr , Subcommittee health press enormous of the comit Joint , took accepted , to the behalf of the government Trudeau , of add the section 35 to health Constitution .
the bill of bill C - 9 represents the a of people major results of our efforts of the era .
the comit Joint guardian constitutional by gun the Senator Harry Hays et by a fringant MP of the Quebec , became since the fringant Senator Joyal .
i the Robbie the government to the Senate , decreased that the former Senator my my first the Opposition .
the a of people members committees of the another place whose the attendance guardian around guardian Eymard Corbin , today today Senator .
that the lights me pardonne if I I Commerce of mention which that what authorized to the Senate which ago sat to what Committee to title of member Standing .
accordingly ending , I bring late that a Senate whose certain of people members committees more of 20 years of experience ago ship once contribution useful to contribute favour 1910 of political self .
the hon. rald - A .
honourable senators , bearer agreed - because he apply notional well of a agreed , et non of a treaty - is then to health Constitution , to health Charter of people rights et to the Code criminal .
confirms fact lot .
my Gotcha concern , et may - perhaps could - lights the Examine more favour depth favour Committee , took truck to people skills and to the regard of la Francophonie of people Nisga' determined .
confirms is without precedent , Ambassador what sense that , contained the system federal Heritage , he there ago sharing of people powers between the federal et people provinces .
thus , health Francophonie is exercée the by the Parliament of the Canada , and by people legislatures legislatures provincial .
the system operating very well .
i I heard say that - et you me corrigerez if I me through - contained certain case , what which fact competition to health Francophonie not is of jurisdiction nor federal nor Comments ; confirms means may - perhaps say that he there ago $ the flou someone share contained the agreed .
Roberta health extent where the agreed not amend not the sharing of people powers between Ottawa et people provinces , I am does .
is - what the case ?
the Senator Austin :
i wish thanking the Senator Beaudoin of dapper issue .
as I the I said contained my speech , he there ago series provision particular which specific that bearer agreed not visit favour nothing health independent of people powers between the Canada Reorganizationand health Columbia - Columbia .
thus , he there ago the section 35 we people rights confidence contained bearer agreed .
these rights receive once protection BNA , but confirms not visit favour nothing health independent of people powers .
health Constitution , namely of the agreed between the government federal et people provinces , qualified people rights of people aboriginal once once that the Parliament et health Columbia - Columbia resulted UN the agreed to the average of once bill .
the Senator Beaudoin :
i not I participate nil problem with the section 35 , because he gives of people rights - to people aboriginal contained health Constitution of the Canada .
i am everyone to fact favour favour of these rights , because people aboriginal were here people premiers .
my issue door simply Act la Domination of a power by report to a another when of people powers are by concurremment .
when what bill of bill arranged examined by a Committee , I hope that lights existing endorsed issue more favour depth .
the rest of the agreed not me questions nil problem .
the Senator Austin :
i want with look endorsed study .
the Senator interest a standpoint importance .
i thought that contained certain case , people powers of the Council tribal nisga' ago stay Domination , mostly favour what which motivator people rights linguistic et Cultural .
however , they are always subjects to the criterion of the character reasonable set contained the v. Sparrow , because endorsed untold fact part of our right constitutional .
the hon. Gerald J . Comeau :
honourable senators , I I listened carefully the speech of the Senator et once of condolences issues door Act people pre of salmon help contained health Newcastle Nass .
however , he there ago one average by cetera the Minister et health crown arresting grant of people pre of fishing , authorized the section 7 of la Act Act people fisheries .
the government may same create of people reservations exclusives of fishing , what which is plan contained the treaty nisga' ago .
as lights the specific contained the section 7 , confirms must apply do by the Adopted of once extent legislative rules .
the treaty introduces once Zone of fishing alone which arranged then protégée favour under of the section 35 of la Constitution .
by therefore , people parliamentarians céderont their power legislative disability health independent of endorsed resources common .
asset once of people creation once of the history , of people parliamentarians the to a duty , ended contained health Constitution , of protect once resources Public .

the hon. Senator Fraser ) .
the hon. Joan Fraser :
honourable senators , when I rise health speak here to health chamber , I trying favour General of using people two languages Official .
today today however , I me exprimerai favour English only asset the my Senators to similar of all those which exhortent the government of the Ontario to adopt once bill deal that health new vast city of Ottawa arranged officially the .
i me adresserai to you favour English only because that I believe that he is important of recognize that what is once issue which motivator all people Canadians , people anglophones , people francophones , those that we so to the Quebec people the et people aboriginal , that they speak people two languages Official or only once or same no of people two .
he there ago good number of reasons asset reasons health city of Ottawa , et not only health region of la Capital national which do to the government federal , should perhaps officially the .
health first , which apply i to the plan timeless , what is that a orator number of francophones there living , over 40,000 I believe .
i know what that confirms means of see his milled government hesitate to recognize health legitimacy of dapper community linguistic , his right to perhaps Land to share full asset what that she is , what is - to - say a attribut of a of people Peoples behind of what country .
i know what that confirms means of hear his government provincially say someone something of the type " Regardez as we you the well .
you this perhaps both asset all these good things that we advanced asset you .
no whether mostly not to perhaps recognized asset what that you intervention .
no you but not to what that lights you receive of people rights .
damned Appendix favour , - lights ?
confirms fact evil , honourable senators .
confirms you gives the Appendix that home you , contained your milled province , not intervention not considered as a citizen to share full same if your from resulted contributed to build what country et that health Constitution lack your language as the once of people two languages Official of the country .
honourable senators , we know all that , since once generation , people governments . the , there including the government Present , acclaimed worked of people efforts of asset implement Act foot et offer a vast economic of services of langue aise et asset assist people francophones to build et to function strip institutions regarding essential .
well that we regrettions may - perhaps all deep health situation to the two the et that we espérions may - perhaps , as I the 6 , that she arranged courts of manner certainly , he is also important of recognize that the government the Present ago retired the initiative of making to people francophones the control of people schools some .
what not is not nothing .
i favour pay tribute to the government of the Ontario .
we , all that we , here , to the Parliament federal et that , to the Canada , people municipalities within of la jurisdiction of people provinces .
we know that health creation of la mégaville is once affair of jurisdiction Comments .
he not there ago useful nil of between we which the called .
what is also there that Ottawa is a case special .
what is once municipally inquiry , surely , but what not is not once municipally as people other , because Ottawa et Ottawa Gotcha is health Capital national .
health region of la Capital national not is not health Capital .
what is once region , once great region , Richard et that as he tangibly , once wonderful recognition cost of the importance of la Capital asset all people Canadians ; but Ottawa , health city of Ottawa , is health Capital .
singing the Canada , we we two languages Official .
what is a aspect basic of our history , of our existence as country .
what is a of people pillars of our identity et of our political national .
how apply may - he that health Capital of the country not should not regulation what fact wonderful ?
breaching message confirms available he to people Canadians , not only to people francophones but to all people Canadians , when we let that , even if we we two languages Official , Gotcha the once of firms is really official here , contained health Capital she - even ?
honourable senators , the spring last , he me ago summer given of visit Bruxelles , health Capital of a country to people taken with of people problems linguistic which relèguent people May to of people up of children .
i am sure that you know that health , is the favour cantons French et flamands , but , officially , Ambassador practice et of by coloured laws , Bruxelles is once city the .
he should favour perhaps thus et we should we favour the .
from such regulation that , if we , asset that health city of Ottawa authorized the , we must also insist asset that similar of Hull the authorized also .
confirms interest a problem of responsible provincially .
accordingly activist that Québécoise of langue English , I assure hoped the that the government of the Quebec receive to Hull the status official of city the , as he the ago fact asset of other municipalities , there including similar where I opinion .
but confirms not motivator favour nothing health city of Ottawa .
i am sure , honourable senators , that we we all been see of learn that health municipally of Ottawa ago asked to the government of the Ontario ' recognize to endorsed , - city the status of city the .
i believe whether that odyssey the government provincially may recognize what status to once municipally inquiry .
he there ago strokes of people advantage Before people courts to bearer greenhouse .
we know that certain circles face once long to endorsed extent .
obviously health long huge whose I am to the aware springs of anglophones , et once vast part of endorsed long seems apply express by health turn , once turn of people consequences that the status the of la Capital national could wheel asset people anglophones who on to Ottawa .
well course , lot of people concerned the change et sometimes , endorsed turn is , ; however , a little of change is change .
a little of change allows of build a future better asset our country et asset we all , which impotent dangerous he of favour perhaps people citizens .
we can happen to embrasser what change .
i looking to condolences parents , of people anglophones of la Scotia - Scotia , credit of strip deep , which remontaient to 200 years contained our country .
they not resulted never spoke French .
Undeterred that I side , nil of strip from not speaking French , the gaélique , yes , but not the French .
when condolences parents were young , health question of the bilingualism et of the period not pointait same not to the going .
Roberta people years 60 , when the Canada English ago finally including bearer discussed of the history , of the identity et of the future of our country , condolences parents resulted been Incidence people million of Canadians English to the understand themselves also et to apply the of the identity the et biculturelle of our country .
they not resulted not learned the French , but they resulted fact favour hallmark that I the apprenne , because they point that all people Canadians which favour sons health possibility should speak people two languages of the Canada .
they were proud that I appointment learned the French .
i their am éternellement for of me favour wheel offered health possibility .
why we of people flags , by example , if the symbolisme not is not important ?
the symbolisme is once something extremely important asset we all .
et where is - what more important that contained health Capital of the country ?
finally , I orders that if Ottawa not is not once city as people other , the Ontario is once province not as people other .
she ago always contributed to several of people elements of our identity whose we impotent if proud - Status tolerance , the openness of mind , the balance whose we we targuons .
i urges therefore the government of the Ontario , once once still , of responsibilities his role historic of Opposition of leadership .
as we the we heard favour endorsed visit today today et people days advantage , lights is favour emerging of And very seriously of other due asset that Ottawa retain the status of city the that she deserves , to my notice .
once Action favour justice is portion by our colleague , the hon. Senator Joyal , without doubt the more infatigable veteran of people rights of people minorities that we do .
he is issue that the government federal is .
apply he tangibly favour happen headed , that he favour authorized thus , but he citing dangerous more comes that the government of the Ontario consistent what that resulted fact activist of coloured and before him , that he states his exercise et share its role historic which is of apply show the proud the of what that he there ago $ better to the Canada .
i urges of everyone my heart the government of the Ontario to hold account of people supplications of endorsed chamber et of activist of Canadians .

what is say that people structures et people powers of a council any are the attribut of people provinces .
lights must meet the sharing of people powers .
however , Ottawa not is not once city as people other , what is health Capital of the Canada .
et to the heart of what country , people main institutions federal are services : the Parliament federal , health Court Supreme of the Canada , the during et people departments .
a section of la Constitution of the Canada , the section 16 , immunities of la Capital of the Canada Reorganizationand Auditor that the seat of the government federal is to Ottawa .
