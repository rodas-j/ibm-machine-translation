my issue apply states � health situation � health mine of coal of Phalen .
lights is favour emerging of d�monter health line of - et people levels inf�rieurs of la mine .
transport miners esp�rent that health social sup�rieure of la mine of Phalen not arranged not touch�e , because lights there wherever still approximately 7,5 million of tonnes of coal whose between 5 et 6 million of tonnes of coal r�cup�rable contained people sectors 1A southwestern , 2A southwestern , 1QZ , 2QZ , thereby that 1Y et 2Y .

the Leader of the government � the S�nat the he , d�s that possible , endorsed issue with the Prime Minister , sooner that people miners qualified continue of contribute � health mine of coal of Phalen et of operating these 5 � 6 million of tonnes of coal r�cup�rable ?
the hon. J . in Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) :

as the hon. s�nateur we the ago if well rappel� , we we d�j� v�cu once situation similar , except that I s people issues et that he the people r�ponses .
the s�nateur Buchanan :
what is right , et you obteniez always health right r�ponse .
the s�nateur Boudreau :
the hon. s�nateur coming may - �tre health situation Current more agr�able .
before of r�pondre � health question of the hon. s�nateur , I like 209 people observations appointments everyone � the hour .
what is with lot of humilit� that I I accept� people responsabilit�s which me resulted �t� confi�es , of tree more that my pr�d�cesseur people ago assum�es of fa�on remarkable .
i d�sire of elsewhere the favour thanking � the behalf of the S�nat et of la population of the Canada .
honourable s�nateurs , I I �galement �t� tr�s touch� by people words of welcome et people advice that me ago prodigu�s the Opposition of the Opposition , which me ago propos� , between other , of reconsid�rer health dur�e of my s�jour � endorsed v�n�rable institution that is the S�nat .
i him observance that , � what topic , he ago the support total of my �pouse .
accordingly r�ponse � health question pos�e by the hon. s�nateur Buchanan , I r�pondrai that health Devco arranged � the centre of condolences pr�occupations during whole health dur�e of my mandate Present .
we know all two the file since once p�riode consid�rable .
he fact currently the subject of once d�marche favour two �tapes .
health premi�re challenge � find once solution hon. asset people resources Resources which call contained what sector since of many ann�es .
endorsed issue rev�t once vast importance non only asset these people , but also asset all people s�nateurs et asset the government of the Canada .
the another �tape , well s�r , challenge � promote the d�veloppement �conomique asset assist health collectivit� � apply adapt � health Transition favour dissimilar .
human not knows better that the s�nateur which ago pos� health question that he apply notional l� of once sympathy Transition between once �conomie industrial which is the of a uniqueness employer et once �conomie deficit - Taiwan .
once ceremony Transition not is never easy .
accordingly what which motivator la question proprement Prime , I I �videmment endorsed pr�occupation .
i right however that health d�marche which VI � transf�rer people resources � a exploitant of the sector priv� is favour dissimilar .
everyone the world seems apply hear asset say that he apply the of la wish fa�on of rem�dier � health situation .
if people resources houill�res arresting �tre r�cup�r�es et exploit�es s�rement , efficient et �conomiquement , I am number that the Insignia exploitant of the sector priv� �tudiera health proposal tr�s s�rieusement .
the s�nateur Buchanan :
honourable s�nateurs , I not about not of la privatization .
i I my milled view � bearer �gard .
the probl�me that questions people 5 � 6 million of tonnes of coal r�cup�rable , what is that , if health leadership of Devco member � limit health line of - until � people sections sup�rieures of la houill�re Phalen et task - del� , he risk of �tre too later asset that a exploitant of the sector priv� incurred the what coal .
if a exploitant of the sector priv� so � the do , what is tr�s well , but he 50 Robbie that people miners which agreements what work � the dissimilar of people two next ann�es qualified �tre always plan � people benefits of retirement .
as the hon. s�nateur the knows , with la closure of la mine Phalen , a orator number of miners not are not including contained health basic regarding the program of by � health retirement anticip�e .
health mine Phalen ago ferm� before that human not retain envisag� dapper closure et what is the probl�me which we occupies currently .
i like �galement send the s�nateur � the topic of people someone 1 160 miners which manage touch�s by health closure of la mine Phalen .
the process of �vincement ago d�j� commenc� with la houill�re Prince .
transport men which resulted �t� d�plac�s when health mine Phalen ago ferm� et those which apply leading of the maintenance of endorsed mine resulted �vinc� people workers of la houill�re Prince , whose approximately 250 resulted re�u their notice of implementation � foot .
when lights Civil these men - side � people other , confirms fact someone 1 % miners which not , no Benefit of retirement , there including those which resulted 20 ann�es of anciennet� , but which not are not enough �g�s asset wheel 75 points .
i wherever confirms tr�s unfair et what is what that friends also the pr�sident et people members of the ex�cutif of la compelling was the .
he tangibly find a average asset tribute these people - l� plan � the Program of by � health retirement anticip�e .
a bill is possible et what citing tr�s simple .
from people s�nateurs not . not that once �norme op�ration of d�pollution apply thing � health Devco .
health m�me something worth asset health Sydney Steel coal , run he apply produced someone something l� - devastating .
the regarding � health Devco co�tera approximately 3,150 million of dollars .
what program is consid�r� � the hour Current as � damned densit� non not of document - class politics , but of mat�riel .
i asking � the new Minister of deal health question the more t�t possible with the Prime Minister .
authorized said favour Mike , � the dissimilar of la campaign �lectorale Comments favour Scotia - �cosse , the Prime Minister ago adress� once letter � Ms Edna Budden et � people women of people miners their break that he ask � people officials of the minist�re of Examine all people aspects of the Program of by � health retirement anticip�e .
i know apply he the ago fact , but confirms must �tre fact asset that these men not viability not everyone simply laiss�s asset account .
the s�nateur Boudreau :
honourable s�nateurs , as not the know not the s�nateur , the program lanc� by the government ago �t� , touch� by health closure pr�matur�e of la mine .
from thanking , of people people which lend strokes right � the Program of by � health retirement anticip�e , because that they sons balance the anciennet� n�cessaire , not resulted not revival there wheel acc�s � untold of la closure pr�matur�e of similar - side .
they resulted lost the time the whose they sons need asset apply might et resulted therefore �t� touch�s tr�s directly .
then , the program ago also �t� touch� because that health soci�t� the Act the income which avoided �t� g�n�r� by the exploitation of la mine asset endorsed p�riode .
� untold of these two cons�quences of la closure pr�matur�e of la mine , the government ago estim� n�cessaire of Examine the program which Partnerships �t� propos� he there ago someone time � people miners et � strip families .
bearer review is always favour dissimilar .
