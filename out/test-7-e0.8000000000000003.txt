P�RIODE the the
justice Soci�t� de d�veloppement de the Corporation - Tories
justice possibilit� de projects for help them way � r�unir them rising de admissibilit� � the Program de by � Day retirement anticip�e - Possibility Position de the government
the Honourable John Buchanan :
honourable s�nateurs , before de question my issue , I like hoped Day welcome � the Government de the government � the S�nat .
justice life est �trange .
justice derni�re read that I I si�g� within a chamber with the s�nateur Boudreau , I occupais the si�ge fact opposite de the , .
i �tais sitting de the c�t� de la part policy fact parliamentarian that Prime Minister and he �tait de the c�t� de the Lynch .
i am pleased that we we . within Day m�me Position , except that them r�les are renvers�s .
i account well contribute with the Honourable s�nateur during de openness ann�es .
he est possible that he either de this c�t� - l� during few ann�es , but apr�s them next �lections f�d�rales , this eliminated me who si�gerai de this c�t� - l� and him de this c�t� - side .
i am a Human tr�s allow , and the Honourable s�nateur Boudreau the knows .
i like question � the Government de the government � the S�nat a issue sur a regarding who him keeps � heart and who me keeps � heart since de many ann�es .
means ago truck � Day Soci�t� de d�veloppement de the Corporation - Tories , justice Cape .
i know that the Honourable s�nateur the also strong that the s�nateur Graham for d�fendre Day Cape , de the less I the esp�re .
my issue themselves states � Day situation � Day disaster de force de future have
reflecting est fact emerging de d�monter Day line de - and them levels inf�rieurs de la disaster .
business way esp�rent that Day social sup�rieure de la disaster de future not eliminated not touch�e , because remembered there wherever still approximately 7,5 $ de death de force whom between 5 and management million de death de force r�cup�rable within them areas 1A Coast , 2A Coast , 1QZ , 2QZ , thereby that 1Y and 2Y .
justice compelling was the Reference America and them others from repr�sent�s � Day Cape esp�rent that the government f�d�ral , good de them allowing operating Day disaster � the during de them next ann�es , sooner that them way qualified contribute a number total de ann�es for bringing right � their plans � Day end de la p�riode de two years .
otherwise , justice disaster eliminated ferm�e and them workers not stay not right � their plans .
the Government de the government � the S�nat the he , d�s that possible , this issue with the Prime Minister , sooner that them way qualified continue de contribute � Day disaster de force de future and de operating these 5 � management million de death de force r�cup�rable ?
the Honourable J . in Boudreau agreed Leader de the government agreed :
honourable s�nateurs , I thank the s�nateur for his issue .
as the Honourable s�nateur we the ago bombing well rappel� , we we d�j� v�cu a situation similar , except that I s them questions and that he the them r�ponses .
the s�nateur company :
this est right , and you obteniez always Day right r�ponse .
the s�nateur Boudreau :
the Honourable s�nateur coming can - �tre Day situation present longer agr�able .
before de r�pondre � Day question de the Honourable s�nateur , I like speak them comments appointments everyone � the hour .
this est with many de humilit� that I I accept� them responsabilit�s who me were �t� confi�es , de tree longer that my pr�d�cesseur them ago assum�es de fa�on career .
i d�sire de elsewhere the fact thank � the name de the S�nat and de la public de the Canada .
honourable s�nateurs , I I �galement �t� tr�s touch� by them words de welcome and them counsel that me ago prodigu�s the Opposition de the Lynch , who me ago propos� , between others , de reconsid�rer Day dur�e de my s�jour � this v�n�rable institution that est the S�nat .
i him draw that , � this regarding , he ago the support guarantee de my �pouse .
accordingly r�ponse � Day question pos�e by the Honourable s�nateur company , I r�pondrai that Day Cape eliminated � the central de my pr�occupations during whole Day dur�e de my mandate present .
we know all two the record since a p�riode consid�rable .
he fact currently the subject de a d�marche fact two �tapes .
justice premi�re challenge � find a thing Honourable for them resources resources who call within this sector since de many ann�es .
this issue rev�t a vast importance No. only for these people , but also for all them s�nateurs and for the government de the Canada .
the other �tape , although s�r , challenge � promote the d�veloppement �conomique for help Day collectivit� � themselves serving � Day toward fact during .
human not knows better that the s�nateur who ago pos� Day question that he themselves branch l� de a sympathy toward between a �conomie industrial who est the de a single benefits and a �conomie deficit - Taiwan .
a ceremony toward not est never easy .
accordingly this who relative la question proprement Prime , I I �videmment this pr�occupation .
i right however that Day d�marche who designed � transf�rer them resources � a exploitant de the sector priv� est fact during .
everyone the world seems themselves hear for say that he themselves the de la wish fa�on de rem�dier � Day situation .
if them resources houill�res can �tre r�cup�r�es and exploit�es s�rement , efficient and �conomiquement , I am number that the new exploitant de the sector priv� �tudiera Day proposal tr�s s�rieusement .
the s�nateur company :
honourable s�nateurs , I not about not de la monopoly .
i I my own view � regard �gard .
the probl�me that questions them 5 � management million de death de force r�cup�rable , this est that , if Day leadership de Cape member � limit Day line de - until � them sections sup�rieures de la houill�re future and task - del� , he risk de �tre too later for that a exploitant de the sector priv� incurred the this force .
if a exploitant de the sector priv� so � the do , this est tr�s well , but he 50 then that them way who agreements this work � the during de them two next ann�es qualified �tre always plan � them benefits de retirement .
as the Honourable s�nateur the knows , with la mine de la disaster operating , a great number de way not are not including within Day basic regarding the program de by � Day retirement anticip�e .
justice disaster operating ago ferm� before that human not retain envisag� his mine and this est the probl�me who we handed currently .
i like �galement send the s�nateur � the regarding de them something 1 throughout way who manage touch�s by Day mine de la disaster operating have
the process de �vincement ago d�j� commenc� with la houill�re Island .
business men who were �t� d�plac�s when Day disaster operating ago ferm� and those who themselves leading de the face de Clairvaux disaster were �vinc� them workers de la houill�re Island , whose approximately amount were re�u their notice de implementation � feet .
when remembered Civil these men - side � them others , means fact something 1 per dock who not , no benefit de retirement , there including those who were domestic ann�es de anciennet� , but who not are not enough �g�s for bringing fifth CHST .
i wherever means tr�s learned and this est this that friends also the pr�sident and them members de the ex�cutif de la compelling was the .
he must find a average for tribute these people - l� plan � the Program de by � Day retirement anticip�e .
a bill est possible and this citing tr�s easy .
de them s�nateurs not . not that a �norme op�ration de d�pollution themselves thing � Day Cape .
justice m�me something worth for Day performed Steel coal , run he themselves happened something something l� - devastating .
the regarding � Day Cape co�tera approximately witness million de million .
this program est consid�r� � the hour present as � strong densit� No. not de document - class politics , but de mat�riel .
i ask � the new Minister de deal Day question the longer t�t possible with the Prime Minister .
whatever said fact Mike , � the during de la campaign �lectorale Comments fact Nova - �cosse , the Prime Minister ago adress� a letter � Ms Edna Budden and � them women de them way their break that he ask � them officials de the minist�re de look all them issues de the Program de by � Day retirement anticip�e .
i know themselves he the ago fact , but means must �tre fact for that these men not recommend not everyone just laiss�s for account .
the s�nateur Boudreau :
honourable s�nateurs , as not the know not the s�nateur , the program lanc� by the government ago �t� , touch� by Day mine pr�matur�e de la disaster .
de first , de them people who lend had right � the Program de by � Day retirement anticip�e , because that they sons balance the anciennet� n�cessaire , not were not could there bringing acc�s � suffer de la mine pr�matur�e de similar - side .
they were lost the time the whom they sons need for themselves might and were therefore �t� touch�s tr�s directly .
then , the program ago too �t� touch� because that Day soci�t� the sur the income who avoided �t� g�n�r� by the operating de la disaster for this p�riode .
� suffer de these two cons�quences de la mine pr�matur�e de la disaster , the government ago estim� n�cessaire de look the program who had �t� propos� he there ago somewhat time � them way and � their families .
regard review est always fact during .
i I right seen that we able do something something for am�liorer Day situation , p particular for them groups whom we represent de speak and who were �t� directly touch�s by Day mine pr�matur�e de la disaster .
i esp�re that the Prime Minister and them ministers int�ress�s able find a thing � this matter .
i I certainly your int�r�t and your comments also well that them , .

the Minister avoided - he the ? de we say substandard measures he est dispos� � take for that recommend d�bloqu�s them fund n�cessaires � Day r�paration de these d�g�ts within the comt� de the ?
the Honourable J . in Boudreau agreed Leader de the government agreed :
honourable s�nateurs , I think that this ask themselves adresserait � the Minister de la D�fense national .
i think understand , de apr�s this that the s�nateur ago demagogic , that Day province ago petition demand� de the help .

the Honourable Margory LeBreton :
honourable s�nateurs , I d�sire , myself also , Donna Day welcome � the new Government de the government � the S�nat .
and de a � concerned management something fact mati�re de p�ches � .
honourable s�nateurs , business words that I just de deal are Right de proposed other that the former Prime Minister lib�ral de the New - Money , nominated McKenna , literally that cit�es within the editor consolidated Mail de the 5 October 1999 .
he ago demagogic then :
the subject de the government est still less reluisant today today that he not the �tait � the �poque de them �lections agreed fact 1997 ) If
this that them agreed Canadians de the Atlantic agreed want , justice miss something that they looking and were always demand�e � the government f�d�ral , this est a hear , a court , that he reconna�t the probl�me and a the de hope ... ... tienne .
that ago fact the government for r�gler these serious probl�mes ?
he ago compos� 911 and demand� the s�nateur Bernie Boudreau .
then , talking de first de la Nova - �cosse .
honourable s�nateurs , my issue themselves my � the Government de the government � the S�nat .
he themselves branch de la gone possibly fact Nova - �cosse , who ago �t� the th��tre de a v�ritable carnage and Day suffer de many d�c�s .
accordingly his qualit� de Minister responsible de la Nova - �cosse , that stand do the Government de the government for rem�dier � this d�plorable situation ?
est - he pr�t � themselves commitment and � budget that his government putting leaders a bill de critical f�d�ral � Day build and � Day r�fection de them sections were meurtri�res de laroute possibly ?
the Honourable J . in Boudreau agreed Leader de the government agreed :
honourable s�nateurs , I me if when these words Mr. McKenna bound ramen�es sur the the .
i me r�jouis de the fact that , within the speech de the Tr�ne pr�sent� yesterday , he either issue de fa�on tr�s own and effective de la hear that he �voquait .
de them Korea are currently fact during with the Minister de them Transport respecting � them available routi�res .
within the speech de the Tr�ne , he est issue de them available Len during and de Right within the area de them communication .
i wherever means consider .
means themselves inscrira fully within the plan de the government f�d�ral , then that Day Nova - �cosse themselves appr�te � remedy within the new mill�naire .
i I certainly de la question with the Minister .
the s�nateur LeBreton :
honourable s�nateurs , the Government de the government � the S�nat share he the notice exprim� by the former - Prime Minister McKenna ?
good number de those who were d�j� emprunt� this gone know de talking he est issue .
he themselves branch de a tron�on impact extr�mement dangerous , as he fact exists de elsewhere within de others r�gions de our countries .
the s�nateur Boudreau :
honourable s�nateurs , the s�nateur me ask if I share the notice Mr. McKenna who , de surcro�t , wrote d�j� �t� my associ� within a practice de lawyers .
i not the not the Honourable s�nateur fact him break that , sur this developed , I not am not de agreed letter McKenna .
this est ind�niable that Day prosp�rit� g�n�rale who ago �t� cr��e within our countries est almost without pr�c�dent .
the Governor de la Bank de the Canada estimated that Day growth de our �conomie � the during de them four months trimestres est sup�rieure � per per , this who not themselves est never seen .
somebody , malgr� this growth career , our rate de inflation left act � them objectives fix�s - this who engaged a how job .
surely , tariffs how not themselves est not concr�tis� �galement within all them r�gions de our countries .
Mr. . McKenna wanted can - �tre do raises Day situation de fa�on flamboyante .
i inform however say � them honourable s�nateurs that � well de them forth de the Canada Opportunities , business donn�es sur la cr�ation de jobs and the ch�mage story clear that Day prosp�rit� themselves est �tendue .
she not est can - �tre not also important that we the souhaiterions and not themselves can - �tre not fact feel across , but we continue de d�ployer de them hard fact this sense .
we esp�rons that , this bad , we able rely sur the support Mr. McKenna .
by elsewhere , I known tr�s well Day gone fact issue .
i the I emprunt�e � ground opportunities .
the r�seau impact Main de la Nova - �cosse , who ago downsizing b�n�fici� de the funding de the government f�d�ral , est fact enough good �tat , m�me themselves he not est not throughout across .
he we must reconna�tre the r�le that the s�nateur company ago jou� � regard �gard .
justice province de la Nova - �cosse poss�de a good r�seau impact , but I the r�p�te , he not est however not throughout .
the Honourable s�nateur ago parl� de a gone who n�cessite de them am�liorations .
i not doubt not that the Minister de them Transport lack de la question with his its Comments fact this mati�re .
the environment
justice Nova - �cosse - Provision regarding de them �tangs bitumeux de performed
the Honourable raised Spivak :
honourable s�nateurs , my issue themselves my �galement � the Government de the government � the S�nat .
he speaks remarqu� without doubt that our premi�res questions for the implement � the �preuve together sur la r�gion that he conna�t the better .
i not bring not de Tocqueville sur his habilit� � we them questions that we him we pos�es until � now .
numbers de my friend environnementalistes call de - - feet since long for attention the attention de the government sur this issue .
accordingly fact , Mr. soon Deleskie , a particular , wrote m�me fact Day gr�ve de la he .
he ago line de longer , 1992 de d�contaminer them �tangs � the help de a easy pelle .
before that the Minister r�ponde � Day question , I like him say that , r�cemment , the S�nat ago adopt� a bill de bill minist�riel who not forward nor de the enl�vement nor de la papers de products weapons directly dangerous as them PCB who themselves friends within this held contamin� .
the Honourable J . in Boudreau agreed Leader de the government agreed :
honourable s�nateurs , I thank Milne the s�nateur de his issue .
accordingly fact , I thank all them s�nateurs de question de them questions sur a r�gion that I known enough well .
i known well Day question de them �tangs bitumeux de performed .
within the pass� , he there ago privileged de them dialogue de d�contamination de them �tangs bitumeux .
some de between firms were co�t� tr�s paid and not were not donn� de good r�sultats .
reflecting ago d�pens� many de money for not obtain that de . r�sultats .
business two orders de government , whatever that either their and policy , were tent� de restrictions de them rural � Day collectivit� .
these dialogue were �galement �chou� .
however , this read - side , within the framework de Clairvaux important lead , the government f�d�ral , with the help de the government Comments , particularly something only million de million for good this who , we the esp�rons , should �tre the r�glement d�finitif de this probl�me .
however , realize held de the exp�rience de the pass� , exp�rience who not �tait not tr�s plaisante or the , he ago �t� d�cid� de do participate Day collectivit� � Day research de a thing � this probl�me .
justice thing propos�e had de la communaut� .
the probl�me with this fa�on de do this est that similar - side require de the time .
he est many longer quick de restrictions a thing that de consider � obtain a appeared � the within de la collectivit� .
by cons�quent , a group Joint compos� de repr�sentants de various areas de la communaut� ago �t� implemented sur feet .
the government f�d�ral ago particip� � a program , within with the government Comments , and those - side themselves are engag�s � provide only million de million , whose rate per the de the f�d�ral .
a commitment significant ago �t� taken .
the group Joint est sur the developed de complete Day premi�re �tape de his work and he esp�re that de them measures has able �tre taken the longer soon possible .
means worth Day worth de negative this appeared � the within de la communaut� .
i I seen de them case o� the remembered ago opt� for the other thing and them r�sultats francophone not were not �t� tr�s are .
business principles de the benefits by them the , de la pr�vention de la pollution and de the �limination we de them products weapons directly - Possibility Position de the government
the Honourable raised Spivak :
honourable s�nateurs , a appeared � the within de la communaut� est a something wonderful .
however , within this case - side Day responsabilit� de this who themselves est happened not can certainly not �tre imput�e � Day collectivit� .
this est Day company who ago laiss� a g�chis .
account held de the bill de bill that we represent de adopt , the Government de the government support he personal them principles according compete the pollueur must pay and , especially , the �limination we de la plant , de la papers and de the use de approval products weapons directly , sooner that within the future we not participate longer confront�s � this probl�me ?
accordingly Mike , remembered ago wheelchair parliamentarian de time with them rural impos�es by the government and without appeared structure that the little de time that he compensated for reach � this appeared not est not a regarding de pr�occupation .
i like bringing a id�e de the view de the Minister de la Nova - �cosse , Deputy de the government � the S�nat , sur them principles tr�s substantial de the pollueur - and , de la pr�vention de la pollution and , increasingly significant still , de the �limination we de the brings and de la papers de la most de them products weapons directly .
reflecting comes just de d�couvrir that them World � the wide de la British - British were a rate tr�s �lev� de will within their body , this who est result � Day papers and � the use de many products weapons .
the Honourable J . in Boudreau agreed Leader de the government agreed :
honourable s�nateurs , justice bringing local and the maintained de a appeared structure were �t� demand�s � them two orders de government by Day collectivit� .
the government themselves est realized � these requ�tes .
this est a process tr�s floor and n�cessaire , m�me themselves he ralentit a little them progr�s sur the land .
for this who est de the other issue soulev�e by the Honourable s�nateur , I right that he ago special per years for B.C. the �tang de lack .
reflecting any , not a ceremony pollution themselves debt today today .
i not I nil developed de d�saccord majeur with this that ago demagogic the Honourable s�nateur .
i like well discussion de this regarding longer fact discussion with she , but nothing de this that she ago demagogic not me to particuli�rement .
we not must never allow that a ceremony situation themselves r�p�te .
the s�nateur Spivak :
honourable s�nateurs , I am pleased de see that the Government de the government � the S�nat receiving � the less with we that he must �liminer for Day plant de la most de them products weapons directly .
thank for this d�claration tr�s �clairante .

de longer , this est de la qualit� de his d�cisions and de his Kyoto that d�pendra the well - �tre de the Canada and de them Canadians .
justice Gouverneure g�n�rale ago parl� de them board that the government ago the intended de take and de them closing who can now themselves open - de them closing themselves - � the Canada sur a future better and longer int�ressant for them premi�res g�n�rations de Canadians de the next mill�naire .
these closing over � Entr�e � , and No. � Sortie � .

today today , honourable s�nateurs , I like you receive a word de la fa�on whom I do our countries - de his pass� , de his pr�sent and certainly de his future , socially that I the con�ois .
this est for me a honour and a great changes de power take Day speak fact r�ponse � the speech de the Tr�ne .
as I just de position that I . you do share de my C personal , he est significant that I Day i with experts .
since my arriv�e � the S�nat , I understand better the v�ritable sense de these as ; then let - me de you d�crire Day mani�re - or plut�t them mani�res - whom I per�ois our countries .
he there ago totally de first a issue de g�ographie , weekly est safety .
i institution � the central de the Canada .
m�me if this d�claration can choquer good number de persons within this city , and de many others � Toronto , this est n�anmoins real .
the central - conceived de Winnipeg not est that � domestic minutes de the central longitudinal de the Canada .
this not est not only a singularit� g�ographique , this est �galement a r�alit� must .
means means that he there ago two fuseaux horaires � the Coast and two and half - reputation three - � the est .
means means that Day moiti� Coast de our province refl�te the whose foreign and Day vast beaut� de them Rural decreased that similar themselves its � the est est per ancr�e within the Bouclier Museum .
reflecting any can living o� I institution , between Day Saskatchewan and the Ontario , without bringing de the countries a example diff�rente de Right that fact were de them persons less favoris�es .
honourable s�nateurs , I me refer de you like de turn that you not confondiez our situation g�ographique with the the or the insularit� .
our links cultural and language with the Qu�bec are per enracin�s within Day communaut� franco - manitobaine �tablie � Saint - Boniface .
during whole the history de the Canada , she ago �t� the a de them two communaut�s de fran and de hemp fran�aises them longer important � the ext�rieur de the Qu�bec .
our graduate written - de them areas de the th��tre , de the the and de la enjoy - finding are learning a renomm�e International and are enracin�es within a raising m�lange de groups available .
our world de them business , b�ti fact longer de a si�cle de trade Covenant de products de basis and now raising de the making de them new establishing , est a de them longer open sur the ext�rieur .
we consid�rons the world world as our march� continue .
our producers , 10 and n�gociants include since long Day r�alit� de la economy who their r�ussit well .
justice hearts de the Manitoba within the world ago can - �tre trouv� his ' Day longer �clatante within them Games panam�ricains rates r�ussis who themselves are held home we the �t� last .
this naturally the �v�nement the longer significant de the kind de whole the history de the Canada and the troisi�me fact importance � themselves �tre held o� that this either within the world .
none not avoided better word we tell � the Canada and � the world world .
honourable s�nateurs , m�me if I seems pr�cher for my always fact bad these derni�res comments , this not �tait not my intended .
i , just � remind that the Manitoba and Winnipeg are de them �l�ments one de the Canada present , de o� he est significant de late and de speak them main questions who themselves questions .
Joe without malice , this heart , if she not est not grants fact issue , risk de lead � a aware incompr�hension de the countries , de his needs and de his possibilit�s .
our p�res de la Conf�d�ration were including this safe and were con�u the S�nat de mani�re � ensure a repr�sentation �quilibr�e de all them r�gions .
those de between we who not represent not de centres owned de public we the build and Day responsabilit� de speak strong and often , brilliant � the S�nat that � them comit�s , de ceremony hallmark that all them Canadians themselves hear hear .
i say also today today as member de a g�n�ration fact particular , this who conditionne origin my developed de view .
i am n� � the the de la War War World , de hallmark that some �v�nements and some id�es de Clairvaux �poque and de them ann�es who were imm�diatement follow are always costs � my m�moire .
i I fact my �tudes especially within them fantastiques ann�es tremendous , d�cennie whom remembered ago fact the less de case within this si�cle .
i I began my premi�res activit�s political just � the payment o� Lester Pearson each Day leadership de the Party lib�ral de the Canada .
de elsewhere , this est � the during de a soir�e pass�e fact company Mr. Pearson , then Opposition de the Lynch , and de a growers group � Winnipeg , moving Day end de them ann�es tremendous , that I me am engag� for Day life shown the Party lib�ral .
i I de first travaill� as official sur la Hill � Ottawa , during Mr. Pearson �tait Prime Minister .
the , I not cannot me emp�cher de negative that , m�me themselves he ago �t� Opposition de the government during � worth five years and themselves he not ago never dirig� a government The , Mr. Pearson ago chang� and our the Canada for always .
accordingly bad this d�claration , I think � them centres program social that him and his government we were donn�s .
means said , he me est arriv� the other Order still de think that he est well difficult de recognition the Canada fact 1999 without our flag the .
for well de them Canadians , tariffs offence de any volont� policy and de fiert� for the Canada real inclusion �re Pearson .
i I �galement �t� t�moin de the �mergence Mr. hesitate and de them d�buts de his career exercise .
Ottawa �tait become a p�le de the for them young men and them young women , along de �nergie and de id�es , who $ that everyone �tait possible and that the Canada �tait the place o� this �tait r�alisable .
nil de those - and he there fact ago several within this visit today today - who �taient here � this �poque and who were partag� them exp�riences de these ann�es not declaration never them remember and , who longer est , not ago never since known a ceremony effervescence within our countries .
he there ago series something research that we we apprise then : not never Subcommittee - Use the Canada and not never , � the great never , Subcommittee - Use the importance and Day being de the id�e de the Canada for them Canadians and for them people de the world world .
honourable s�nateurs , run he est a remember that I Access de them ann�es House �  , this est the career Stratton de positive who themselves d�gageait de across and who impr�gnait everyone a each .
the matter �tait the requires own and the de la seen de the Canada fact break and within his hearts within the world .
� Day r�flexion , I me pay now account de the power �norme de a becomes Stratton de seen and de positive thus that de la concern increase de �nergie that he can �tre for a countries and his Columbians .
today today , I not cannot me emp�cher de consid�rer Day strength de the Canada and de his �conomie , the lack de everyone find Covenant de government , justice r�volution �poustouflante who themselves pr�pare within the area de them Social and de la Social thus that Day puissante name de all these serious who , together , not can that am�liorer Day qualit� and Day foreign de la life de all them Canadians and de them almost management billion de �tres Agriculture who concerns our plan�te , without , a read de longer , and still longer intens�ment , this m�me positive who me animait when , young Human , I am arriv� sur la Hill de the Parliament .
finally , honourable s�nateurs , I me that � printed de the developed de view de something a who est � the S�nat since tr�s little de time .
i am arriv� here he there ago man little longer de a year adequate attendance a new carri�re .
m�me if I sworn a training de counsel , � the during de them 30 ann�es pr�c�dentes I I �t� a Human de business who themselves est efforc� de b�tir a company exer�ant his activit� � the Canada and elsewhere .
this bad , I I many learned sur them r�alit�s de the considerable de them business and sur the operations de our �conomie .
i I learned that he �tait importance de bringing de them persons the and well form�es within all them have .
i I learned that the exercise est a comp�tence exig�e and appliqu�e � all them levels by whole company prosp�re .
i I learned that Day fiert� �prouv�e respecting � a company and � his products est a cl� research de the succ�s and that Day fiert� that a human �prouve � the �gard de his countries grandit without palliative when our products and services are export�s a little across within the world .
honourable s�nateurs , we must continue de learn the better party de our proximit� and de our links de amiti� and continue de �viter them pi�ges associ�s � them in�galit�s within Day foreign and within the �chelle social .
he fact est thus since that once John A . MacDonald ago fact a premi�re �valuation de our future , and means not ago never �t� also real that today today .
we , Canadians , must remain strong attach�s � our actions and � our identit� .
a soci�t� who not est �prise nor de fairness nor de compassion not cannot r�ellement financial .
however , as them countries de the wonderful are de longer fact longer �troitement reli�s , we must we focus sur them needs duty de the economy si�cle .
de first , he must that the Canada retain a �conomie and a life cultural longer off and longer attirantes for capter the int�r�t de them young Canadians and their offer de new encourage .
this est with these atouts that we able them address � living and � do carri�re here , � the Canada .
honourable s�nateurs , I am always anim� de a strong society , who wherever his concern within the enthusiasm and the positive facing I I go�t� here he there ago longer de 30 years , and I not am not the single � grounds that we can them do revivre .
de them Senators :

honourable s�nateurs , this est a honour and a privil�ge de participate � Day life public � this �poque de our history , a time o� them d�fis are de setting and them possibilit�s stimulantes , a �re de economy and de years technologique .
we caught opportunity � few weeks de a new mill�naire .
the �poque not est not only exaltante for the countries everyone world , she real also a developed funding for Newfoundland - island and the coastal .
these months months de 1999 revenue everyone ensure a time de arr�t during cetera them Newfoundland - one r�fl�chiront � Day hearts that they leading � the within de the countries and � their encourage de future .
today today , Newfoundland - island and the coastal themselves per within Day tourmente de them centres change China and �conomiques who balayent the world .
business people de Clairvaux r�gion not themselves extra however not just ; they compound call � their comp�tences and � their learning de long valid for do opposite � them r�alit�s de the change quick .
gr�ce � their cr�ativit� , their responsible , their solidarit� , their d�termination and their what � the work , they r�alisent their r�ves and young moving the before their province and their countries .
business relevant �conomiques r�centes we fact saying term sur the �volution de our province .
the property compelling de the Canada took signal� that the plus de growth r�elle de the cent de Newfoundland - island , who themselves �l�ve � 5,2p. per , est the longer �lev� � the Canada .
business encourage de jobs themselves am�liorent �galement , because the plus de ch�mage ago diminu� de longer de billion CHST since the year last .
business honourable s�nateurs are � the aware de them retomb�es de m�gaprojets as Hibernia , the am�nagement de the during inf�rieur de the Churchill and the �ventuelle operating de the the de Voisey' St. Bay .
these centres projects are cruciaux for Day r�ussite �conomique de Newfoundland - island , but the history est far de themselves complete l� .
within all them sph�res de the �conomie , de them soci�t�s de our province remportent de them succ�s de longer fact longer �clatants .
surely , business build during as the operating mini�re and de them for�ts and them p�ches its de them �l�ments essential � our well - �tre �conomique .
but means not must not do remember Day v�ritable association de lack who ago commenc� � themselves recognized .
de them soci�t�s implant�es home we compound their real within de them areas as them communication , business technical manufacturi�res de leading and Day management de them d�chets dangerous .
honourable s�nateurs , the a de them areas de growth them longer substantial � Newfoundland - island , these derni�res ann�es , wrote �t� the together , and Day charged should themselves maintain .
� soir�e hon. � , who conclude Day cash de Newfoundland - island � the Canada fact this cinquanti�me anniversary de his entr�e within Day Conf�d�ration , wrote �t� a �clatant succ�s � the �chelle national .
his festivals , his program and his others activit�s , consumer Day taken . de la around de the CN , the �t� last , were known a work succ�s .
these activit�s were contribu� � pr�parer Day next vast c�l�bration , p millennium , similar de the milli�me anniversary de the arriv�e de them many within the New Parliament .
business Games de Games de the Canada de 1999 , held � Corner Brook , were also remport� �norm�ment de succ�s .
qualifi�es de the a de them best �ditions de these games , business comp�titions were fact d�couvrir our province � them t�l�spectateurs and � them Gallery de the together de the countries .
the succ�s de them Games de Games de the Canada , honourable s�nateurs , poor the a de them main Armed de Newfoundland - island that I wish � mention , namely the spirit g�n�reux , ing�nieux , bienveillant and s de them Newfoundland - one .
reflecting said often that them complete �conomiques not as not , � themselves recommendation , � upon this who fact a vast soci�t� .
the Canada does est not become the great countries that he est today today acting fact reason de his retirement �conomique .
he est �vident that de them political �conomiques base and responsible play a r�le significant , and the government water - neuvien everyone as the government f�d�ral should �tre f�licit�s for their subject within this area .
justice was de our province and de our countries not keeps however not acting � their retirement �conomique .
this who fact de the Canada a countries o� he fact good living , this who the . de them �tats - United , this who fact fact the mountains de the world world , this est Day vast parliamentarian de them Canadians who want understand and prot�ger all them members vuln�rables de their soci�t� , all those who not are not fact extent de take experts de themselves - m�mes .
honourable s�nateurs , he not must never take means � Day l�g�re if we want continue de do the mountains de the my world .
we must aware consider � aviver this vast parliamentarian de them Canadians and never Day allowing themselves �teindre .
this est � Newfoundland - island and � the coastal that these actions are them better illustr�es , honourable s�nateurs .
justice qualit� de life de them Newfoundland - one d�passe whole extent �conomique conventionnelle , because he est contempt de included a price � the spirit community , � the requires cultural and � Day compassion .
he not fact nil doubt , honourable s�nateurs , that Day qualit� de life est directly li�e � Day contains g�n�reuse and charitable de a soci�t� .
according the Enqu�te national de 1997 sur the gift , the b�n�volat and Day bringing , business Columbians de Newfoundland - island and de the coastal include still a read among them citizens them longer g�n�reux de the Canada .
longer de the 33 de la public ago donn� de his time � de them choice de education .
business Newfoundland - one affichaient the longer strong rate de cash financi�re � de them organizations de education � the Canada , 84p. per de them Columbians de Newfoundland - island de longer de 15 years having fact de them supply for help is .
this g�n�rosit� de spirit , p d�pit often de time difficult , est profond�ment enracin�e within the history de Newfoundland - island .
this est similar de people who voice de centres revers since approximately years and that the adversit� and together � the held de them s�parer .
�rosion :
honourable s�nateurs , he themselves going well de them things positive today today � Newfoundland - island and � the coastal , but many de d�fis remain � reported and many de probl�mes , � r�soudre .
he est tr�s consider de see that the government f�d�ral themselves commitment , within the speech de the Tr�ne , � themselves address � these probl�mes .
i wish � speak here de two probl�mes fact particular .
the Prime est the probl�me de the paid de them Newfoundland - one .
many de families de Newfoundland - island and de the coastal were Day sense de see printed de them friend and de them face for de others parts de the Canada and de the world .
the d�clin de la public � the 1 beginning last �tait the longer devastating never enregistr� since Day mine de la p�che sur the SUCCESS , , but he est still too �lev� .
he est consider de see that the Prime Minister education and his government are sensibilis�s � this probl�me and d�termin�s � the att�nuer .
he est consider also , honourable s�nateurs , de see that the government f�d�ral themselves commitment , within the speech de the Tr�ne , non only � contribute � remember them young Canadians � the Canada , but also � do whether that the Canada est really the better place o� living � the economy si�cle , a place o� them best and them longer best within the left de the world on come living .
the commitment � b de them fund within Day research , business small . and the youth de them comp�tences help address them young de Newfoundland - island and de across � the Canada � remain within their countries for there continue their r�ves .
we we a d�fi the � reported , honourable s�nateurs , Auschwitz de continue � am�liorer Day qualit� de the education dispens� � our young thus that them possibilit�s de there acc�der .
business young Canadians de Newfoundland - island and de elsewhere esp�rent learn the better party de these new possibilit�s for power �tre own .
they not can the do without a help ad�quate fact mati�re de �ducation .
the Universit� community de Newfoundland - island c�l�bre , p 1999 , his cinquanti�me anniversary fact parliamentarian that �tablissement base d�cerner de them dipl�mes .
since tremendous years , the Universit� community ago jou� a r�le road within the d�veloppement de Newfoundland - island and de the coastal .
m�me if the acc�s � a education de qualit� dispens� by the Universit� community and by de others �tablissements university and coll�giaux de the Canada themselves est �largi � the governmental de them years , de many �tudiants de Newfoundland - island and de across � the Canada does can attendance de them �tudes post � suffer de burden financial as the lack de fund and them costs de scolarit� �lev�s .
de many others are oblig�s de drop their �tudes before de them bringing termin�es � suffer de probl�mes as the �norme debt de them �tudiants .
honourable s�nateurs , I known these probl�mes for them bringing v�cus personal .
without Day opportunity tremendous that ago constitu�e for me Day scolarit� gratuite instaur�e within them ann�es 1960 by the Prime Minister main de the �poque and his government , I think that I not pleased not fact extent de do this Robertson � the S�nat today today .
fortunately , good number de them investment who were �t� annonc�s within the speech de the Tr�ne and who points � am�liorer Day productivit� and � stop against the paid de them funding manage orient�s moving them universit�s Forces , � the support de them activit�s de research and d�veloppement within de them areas as them care de sant� and Day high Social .
combin�es � de them seems as the fund de right de them scholarships de �tudes de the mill�naire , these new resources part address � tribute the education education longer available � them �tudiants .
for power follow a training avanc�e , business children must power very within a considerable s�r o� their needs basic are say and they must �tre encourag�s � themselves the and � b�n�ficier � the reduced de their �tudes living and high .
as them s�nateurs the know , he there ago fairly de children who living within Day pauvret� � the Canada .
passing he not there had that a single child ample � the Canada , means Honourable malgr� everyone maintained � the tremendous senior Economic de our countries .
if the Canada wants r�ussir sur them professional Economic and �conomique within the future , he him must come � across de la pauvret� home them children .
