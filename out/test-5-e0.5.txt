Humanities rï¿½ponse ï¿½ Day question posï¿½e by é hon. sï¿½nateur Buchanan , I rï¿½pondrai that Day Devco eliminated ï¿½ é centre of my prï¿½occupations during whole Day durï¿½e of my mandate present .
we know all two é file since T pï¿½riode considï¿½rable .

Humanities what which relative la question proprement Prime , I I ï¿½videmment this prï¿½occupation .
i right however that Day dï¿½marche which designed ï¿½ transfï¿½rer them resources ï¿½ one exploitant of é sector privï¿½ is Humanities surveillance .
everything é world seems apply hear Citizens say that he apply the of la wish faï¿½on of remï¿½dier ï¿½ Day situation .
if them resources houillï¿½res can ï¿½tre rï¿½cupï¿½rï¿½es et exploitï¿½es sï¿½rement , efficient et ï¿½conomiquement , I am number that é new exploitant of é sector privï¿½ ï¿½tudiera Day proposal trï¿½s sï¿½rieusement .
é sï¿½nateur Buchanan :
honourable sï¿½nateurs , I not about not of la privatization .
i I my own view ï¿½ regard ï¿½gard .
é problï¿½me that questions them 5 ï¿½ 6 million of tonnes of coal rï¿½cupï¿½rable , what is that , if Day leadership of Devco member ï¿½ limit Day line of - until ï¿½ them sections supï¿½rieures of la houillï¿½re future et task - delï¿½ , he risk of ï¿½tre too later Citizens that one exploitant of é sector privï¿½ incurred the what coal .
if one exploitant of é sector privï¿½ so ï¿½ é do , what is trï¿½s well , but he 50 then that them miners which agreements what work ï¿½ é surveillance of them two next annï¿½es qualified ï¿½tre always plan ï¿½ them benefits of retirement .
as é hon. sï¿½nateur é knows , with la mine of la disaster operating , one great number of miners not are not including streets Day basic regarding é program of by ï¿½ Day retirement anticipï¿½e .
