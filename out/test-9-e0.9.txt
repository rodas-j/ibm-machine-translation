justice Soci�t� of d�veloppement of the Corporation - Tories
justice possibilit� of bills for help them way � r�unir them rising of admissibilit� � the Program of by � Day retirement anticip�e - Possibility Position of the government
the hon. John Buchanan :
honourable s�nateurs , before of question my issue , I like hoped Day welcome � the Government of the government � the S�nat .
justice life is �trange .
justice derni�re read that I I si�g� within a chamber with the s�nateur Boudreau , I occupais the si�ge fact opposite of the , .
i �tais sitting of the c�t� of la part policy fact parliamentarian that Prime Minister along it �tait of the c�t� of the Lynch .
i am pleased that us us . within Day m�me Position , except that them r�les are renvers�s .
i account well contribute with the hon. s�nateur during of openness ann�es .
it is possible that it either of this c�t� - l� during few ann�es , but apr�s them next �lections f�d�rales , this eliminated me which si�gerai of this c�t� - l� along him of this c�t� - side .
i am a Human tr�s allow , along the hon. s�nateur Boudreau the knows .
i like question � the Government of the government � the S�nat a issue Act a regarding which him keeps � heart along which me keeps � heart since of many ann�es .
means ago truck � Day Soci�t� of d�veloppement of the Corporation - Tories , justice Cape .
i know that the hon. s�nateur the also strong that the s�nateur Leader for d�fendre Day Cape , of the less I the esp�re .
my issue themselves states � Day situation � Day disaster of force of future have
reflecting is fact emerging of d�monter Day line of - along them levels inf�rieurs of la disaster .
business way esp�rent that Day social sup�rieure of la disaster of future not eliminated not touch�e , because remembered there wherever still approximately 7,5 $ of death of force whom between 5 along management million of death of force r�cup�rable within them areas 1A Coast , 2A Coast , 1QZ , 2QZ , thereby that 1Y along 2Y .
justice compelling was the Reference America along them other from repr�sent�s � Day Cape esp�rent that the government f�d�ral , good of them allowing operating Day disaster � the during of them next ann�es , sooner that them way qualified contribute a number total of ann�es for bringing right � their plans � Day end of la p�riode of two years .
otherwise , justice disaster eliminated ferm�e along them workers not stay not right � their plans .
the Government of the government � the S�nat the it , d�s that possible , this issue with the Prime Minister , sooner that them way qualified continue of contribute � Day disaster of force of future along of operating these 5 � management million of death of force r�cup�rable ?
the hon. raised . in Boudreau agreed Leader of the government agreed :
honourable s�nateurs , I thank the s�nateur for his issue .
as the hon. s�nateur us the ago bombing well rappel� , us we d�j� v�cu a situation similar , except that I s them issues along that it the them r�ponses .
the s�nateur company :
this is right , along you obteniez always Day right r�ponse .
the s�nateur Boudreau :
the hon. s�nateur coming can - �tre Day situation present more agr�able .
before of r�pondre � Day question of the hon. s�nateur , I like speak them comments appointments everyone � the hour .
this is with many of humilit� that I I accept� them responsabilit�s which me were �t� confi�es , of tree more that my pr�d�cesseur them ago assum�es of fa�on career .
i d�sire of elsewhere the fact thank � the name of the S�nat along of la public of the Canada .
honourable s�nateurs , I I �galement �t� tr�s touch� by them words of welcome along them counsel that me ago prodigu�s the Opposition of the Lynch , which me ago propos� , among other , of reconsid�rer Day dur�e of my s�jour � this v�n�rable institution that is the S�nat .
i him draw that , � this regarding , it ago the support guarantee of my �pouse .
accordingly r�ponse � Day question pos�e by the hon. s�nateur company , I r�pondrai that Day Cape eliminated � the central of my pr�occupations during whole Day dur�e of my office present .
us know all two the record since a p�riode consid�rable .
it fact currently the subject of a d�marche fact two �tapes .
justice premi�re challenge � find a thing hon. for them resources resources which call within this sector since of many ann�es .
this issue rev�t a vast importance No. only for these people , but also for all them s�nateurs along for the government of the Canada .
the other �tape , although s�r , challenge � promote the d�veloppement �conomique for help Day collectivit� � themselves serving � Day toward fact during .
human not knows better that the s�nateur which ago pos� Day question that it themselves branch l� of a sympathy toward between a �conomie industrial which is the of a single benefits along a �conomie deficit - Taiwan .
a ceremony toward not is never easy .
accordingly this which relative la question proprement Prime , I I �videmment this pr�occupation .
i right however that Day d�marche which designed � transf�rer them resources � a exploitant of the sector priv� is fact during .
everyone the world seems themselves hear for say that it themselves the of la wish fa�on of rem�dier � Day situation .
if them resources houill�res can �tre r�cup�r�es along exploit�es s�rement , efficient along �conomiquement , I am number that the new exploitant of the sector priv� �tudiera Day proposal tr�s s�rieusement .
the s�nateur company :
honourable s�nateurs , I not about not of la monopoly .
i I my own view � regard �gard .
the probl�me that questions them 5 � management million of death of force r�cup�rable , this is that , if Day leadership of Cape member � limit Day line of - until � them sections sup�rieures of la houill�re future along task - del� , it risk of �tre too later for that a exploitant of the sector priv� incurred the this force .
if a exploitant of the sector priv� so � the do , this is tr�s well , but it 50 then that them way which agreements this work � the during of them two next ann�es qualified �tre always plan � them benefits of retirement .
as the hon. s�nateur the knows , with la mine of la disaster operating , a great number of way not are not including within Day basic regarding the program of by � Day retirement anticip�e .
justice disaster operating ago ferm� before that human not retain envisag� his mine along this is the probl�me which us handed currently .
i like �galement send the s�nateur � the regarding of them something 1 throughout way which manage touch�s by Day mine of la disaster operating have
the process of �vincement ago d�j� commenc� with la houill�re Island .
business men which were �t� d�plac�s when Day disaster operating ago ferm� along those which themselves leading of the face of Clairvaux disaster were �vinc� them workers of la houill�re Island , whose approximately amount were re�u their notice of implementation � feet .
when remembered Civil these men - side � them other , means fact something 1 per dock which not , no benefit of retirement , there including those which were domestic ann�es of anciennet� , but which not are not enough �g�s for bringing fifth CHST .
i wherever means tr�s learned along this is this that friends also the pr�sident along them members of the ex�cutif of la compelling was the .
it must find a average for tribute these people - l� plan � the Program of by � Day retirement anticip�e .
a bill is possible along this citing tr�s easy .
from them s�nateurs not . not that a �norme op�ration of d�pollution themselves thing � Day Cape .
justice m�me something worth for Day performed Steel coal , run it themselves happened something something l� - devastating .
the regarding � Day Cape co�tera approximately witness million of million .
this program is consid�r� � the hour present as � strong densit� No. not of document - class politics , but of mat�riel .
i ask � the new Minister of deal Day question the more t�t possible with the Prime Minister .
whatever said fact Mike , � the during of la campaign �lectorale Comments fact Nova - �cosse , the Prime Minister ago adress� a letter � Ms Edna Budden along � them women of them way their break that it ask � them officials of the minist�re of look all them issues of the Program of by � Day retirement anticip�e .
i know themselves it the ago fact , but means must �tre fact for that these men not recommend not everyone just laiss�s for account .
the s�nateur Boudreau :
honourable s�nateurs , as not the know not the s�nateur , the program lanc� by the government ago �t� , touch� by Day mine pr�matur�e of la disaster .
from first , of them people which lend had right � the Program of by � Day retirement anticip�e , because that they sons balance the anciennet� n�cessaire , not were not could there bringing acc�s � suffer of la mine pr�matur�e of similar - side .
they were lost the time the whom they sons need for themselves might along were therefore �t� touch�s tr�s directly .
then , the program ago too �t� touch� because that Day soci�t� the Act the income which avoided �t� g�n�r� by the operating of la disaster for this p�riode .
� suffer of these two cons�quences of la mine pr�matur�e of la disaster , the government ago estim� n�cessaire of look the program which had �t� propos� it there ago somewhat time � them way along � their families .
regard review is always fact during .
i I right seen that us able do something something for am�liorer Day situation , p particular for them groups whom us represent of speak along which were �t� directly touch�s by Day mine pr�matur�e of la disaster .
i esp�re that the Prime Minister along them ministers int�ress�s able find a thing � this matter .

the hon. raised . in Boudreau agreed Leader of the government agreed :

honourable s�nateurs , business words that I just of deal are Right of proposed other that the former Prime Minister lib�ral of the New - Money , nominated McKenna , literally that cit�es within the editor consolidated Mail of the 5 October Estimates .
it ago demagogic then :
the subject of the government is still less reluisant today today that it not the �tait � the �poque of them �lections agreed fact 1997 ) If
this that them agreed Canadians of the Atlantic agreed want , justice miss something that they looking along were always demand�e � the government f�d�ral , this is a hear , a court , that it reconna�t the probl�me along a the of hope ... ... tienne .

the s�nateur Boudreau :
honourable s�nateurs , the s�nateur me ask if I share the notice Mr. McKenna which , of surcro�t , wrote d�j� �t� my associ� within a practice of lawyers .
i not the not the hon. s�nateur fact him break that , based this developed , I not am not of agreed letter McKenna .
this is ind�niable that Day prosp�rit� g�n�rale which ago �t� cr��e within our countries is almost without pr�c�dent .
the Governor of la Bank of the Canada estimated that Day growth of our �conomie � the during of them four months trimestres is sup�rieure � per per , this which not themselves is never seen .
somebody , malgr� this growth career , our rate of rising left act � them objectives fix�s - this which engaged a how job .
surely , tariffs how not themselves is not concr�tis� �galement within all them r�gions of our countries .
Mr. . McKenna wanted can - �tre do raises Day situation of fa�on flamboyante .
i inform however say � them honourable s�nateurs that � well of them forth of the Canada Opportunities , business donn�es Act la cr�ation of jobs along the ch�mage story clear that Day prosp�rit� themselves is �tendue .
she not is can - �tre not also important that us the souhaiterions along not themselves can - �tre not fact feel across , but us continue of d�ployer of them hard fact this sense .
us esp�rons that , this bad , us able rely Act the support Mr. McKenna .

the r�seau impact Main of la Nova - �cosse , which ago downsizing b�n�fici� of the funding of the government f�d�ral , is fact enough good �tat , m�me themselves it not is not throughout across .
it us must reconna�tre the r�le that the s�nateur company ago jou� � regard �gard .
justice province of la Nova - �cosse poss�de a good r�seau impact , but I the r�p�te , it not is however not throughout .
the hon. s�nateur ago parl� of a gone which n�cessite of them am�liorations .

before that the Minister r�ponde � Day question , I like him say that , r�cemment , the S�nat ago adopt� a bill of bill minist�riel which not forward nor of the enl�vement nor of la papers of products weapons directly dangerous as them PCB which themselves friends within this held contamin� .
the hon. raised . in Boudreau agreed Leader of the government agreed :
honourable s�nateurs , I thank Milne the s�nateur of his issue .
accordingly fact , I thank all them s�nateurs of question of them issues Act a r�gion that I known enough well .
i known well Day question of them �tangs bitumeux of performed .
within the pass� , it there ago privileged of them dialogue of d�contamination of them �tangs bitumeux .
some of between firms were co�t� tr�s paid along not were not donn� of good r�sultats .
reflecting ago d�pens� many of money for not obtain that of . r�sultats .
business two orders of government , whatever that either their and political , were tent� of restrictions of them rural � Day collectivit� .
these dialogue were �galement �chou� .
however , this read - side , within the framework of Clairvaux important lead , the government f�d�ral , with the help of the government Comments , particularly something only million of million for good this which , us the esp�rons , should �tre the r�glement d�finitif of this probl�me .
however , realize held of the exp�rience of the pass� , exp�rience which not �tait not tr�s plaisante ou the , it ago �t� d�cid� of do participate Day collectivit� � Day research of a thing � this probl�me .
justice thing propos�e had of la communaut� .
the probl�me with this fa�on of do this is that similar - side require of the time .
it is many more quick of restrictions a thing that of consider � obtain a appeared � the within of la collectivit� .
by cons�quent , a group Joint compos� of repr�sentants of various areas of la communaut� ago �t� implemented Act feet .
the government f�d�ral ago particip� � a program , within with the government Comments , along those - side themselves are engag�s � provide only million of million , whose rate per the of the f�d�ral .
a commitment significant ago �t� taken .
the group Joint is Act the developed of complete Day premi�re �tape of his work along it esp�re that of them action has able �tre taken the more soon possible .

i I seen of them case o� the remembered ago opt� for the other thing along them r�sultats francophone not were not �t� tr�s are .
business principles of the benefits by them the , of la pr�vention of la pollution along of the �limination we of them products weapons directly - Possibility Position of the government
the hon. raised Spivak :
honourable s�nateurs , a appeared � the within of la communaut� is a something wonderful .
however , within this case - side Day responsabilit� of this which themselves is happened not can certainly not �tre imput�e � Day collectivit� .
this is Day company which ago laiss� a g�chis .
account held of the bill of bill that us represent of adopt , the Government of the government support it personal them principles according compete the pollueur must pay along , especially , the �limination we of la plant , of la papers along of the use of approval products weapons directly , sooner that within the future us not participate more confront�s � this probl�me ?
accordingly Mike , remembered ago wheelchair parliamentarian of time with them rural impos�es by the government along without appeared structure that the little of time that it compensated for reach � this appeared not is not a regarding of pr�occupation .
i like bringing a id�e of the view of the Minister of la Nova - �cosse , Deputy of the government � the S�nat , based them principles tr�s substantial of the pollueur - and , of la pr�vention of la pollution along , more significant still , of the �limination we of the brings along of la papers of la most of them products weapons directly .
reflecting comes just of d�couvrir that them World � the wide of la British - British were a rate tr�s �lev� of will within their body , this which is result � Day papers along � the use of many products weapons .
the hon. raised . in Boudreau agreed Leader of the government agreed :
honourable s�nateurs , justice bringing local along the maintained of a appeared structure were �t� demand�s � them two orders of government by Day collectivit� .
the government themselves is realized � these requ�tes .
this is a process tr�s floor along n�cessaire , m�me themselves it ralentit a little them progr�s Act the land .
for this which is of the other issue soulev�e by the hon. s�nateur , I right that it ago special per years for B.C. the �tang of lack .
reflecting any , not a ceremony pollution themselves debt today today .
i not I nil developed of d�saccord majeur with this that ago demagogic the hon. s�nateur .
i like well discussion of this regarding more fact discussion with she , but nothing of this that she ago demagogic not me to particuli�rement .
us not must never allow that a ceremony situation themselves r�p�te .
the s�nateur raised :

as I just of position that I . you do share of my C personal , it is significant that I Day i with experts .
since my arriv�e � the S�nat , I understand better the v�ritable sense of these as ; then let - me of you d�crire Day mani�re - ou plut�t them mani�res - whom I per�ois our countries .
it there ago totally of first a issue of g�ographie , weekly is safety .
i institution � the central of the Canada .
m�me if this d�claration can choquer good number of persons within this city , along of many other � Toronto , this is n�anmoins real .
the central - conceived of Winnipeg not is that � domestic minutes of the central longitudinal of the Canada .
this not is not only a singularit� g�ographique , this is �galement a r�alit� must .
means means that it there ago two fuseaux horaires � the Coast along two along half - reputation three - � the is .
means means that Day moiti� Coast of our province refl�te the whose foreign along Day vast beaut� of them Rural decreased that similar themselves its � the is is per ancr�e within the Bouclier Museum .
reflecting any can living o� I institution , among Day Saskatchewan along the Ontario , without bringing of the countries a example diff�rente of Right that fact were of them persons less favoris�es .
honourable s�nateurs , I me refer of you like of turn that you not confondiez our situation g�ographique with the the ou the insularit� .
our links cultural along language with the Qu�bec are per enracin�s within Day communaut� franco - manitobaine �tablie � Saint - Boniface .
during whole the history of the Canada , she ago �t� the a of them two communaut�s of fran along of hemp fran�aises them more important � the ext�rieur of the Qu�bec .
our graduate written - of them areas of the th��tre , of the the along of la enjoy - finding are learning a renomm�e International along are enracin�es within a raising m�lange of groups available .
our world of them business , b�ti fact more of a si�cle of trade Covenant of products of basis along now raising of the making of them new establishing , is a of them more open Act the ext�rieur .
us consid�rons the world world as our march� continue .
our producers , 10 along n�gociants include since long Day r�alit� of la economy which their r�ussit well .
justice hearts of the Manitoba within the world ago can - �tre trouv� his ' Day more �clatante within them Games panam�ricains rates r�ussis which themselves are held home us the �t� last .
this naturally the �v�nement the more significant of the kind of whole the history of the Canada Reorganizationand the troisi�me fact importance � themselves �tre held o� that this either within the world .
none not avoided better word us tell � the Canada Reorganizationand � the world world .
honourable s�nateurs , m�me if I seems pr�cher for my always fact bad these derni�res comments , this not �tait not my intended .
i , just � remind that the Manitoba along Winnipeg are of them �l�ments one of the Canada present , of o� it is significant of late along of speak them main issues which themselves questions .
Joe without malice , this heart , if she not is not grants fact issue , risk of lead � a aware incompr�hension of the countries , of his needs along of his possibilit�s .
our p�res of la Conf�d�ration were including this safe along were con�u the S�nat of mani�re � ensure a repr�sentation �quilibr�e of all them r�gions .
those of between us which not represent not of centres owned of public we the build along Day responsabilit� of speak strong along often , brilliant � the S�nat that � them comit�s , of ceremony hallmark that all them Canadians themselves hear hear .
i say also today today as member of a g�n�ration fact particular , this which conditionne origin my developed of view .
i am n� � the the of la War War World , of hallmark that some �v�nements along some id�es of Clairvaux �poque along of them ann�es which were imm�diatement follow are always costs � my m�moire .
i I fact my �tudes especially within them fantastiques ann�es tremendous , d�cennie whom remembered ago fact the less of case within this si�cle .
i I began my premi�res activit�s political just � the payment o� waters Pearson each Day leadership of the Party lib�ral of the Canada .
from elsewhere , this is � the during of a soir�e pass�e fact company Mr. Pearson , then Opposition of the Lynch , along of a growers group � Winnipeg , moving Day end of them ann�es tremendous , that I me am engag� for Day life shown the Party lib�ral .
i I of first travaill� as official Act la Hill � Ottawa , during Mr. Pearson �tait Prime Minister .
the , I not cannot me emp�cher of negative that , m�me themselves it ago �t� Opposition of the government during � worth five years along themselves it not ago never dirig� a government The , Mr. Pearson ago chang� along our the Canada for always .
accordingly bad this d�claration , I think � them centres program social that him along his government us were donn�s .
means said , it me is arriv� the other Order still of think that it is well difficult of recognition the Canada fact Estimates without our flag the .
for well of them Canadians , tariffs offence of any volont� political along of fiert� for the Canada real inclusion �re Pearson .
i I �galement �t� t�moin of the �mergence Mr. hesitate along of them d�buts of his career exercise .
Ottawa �tait become a p�le of the for them young men along them young women , along of �nergie along of id�es , which $ that everyone �tait possible along that the Canada �tait the place o� this �tait r�alisable .
nil of those - Liaison it there fact ago throwback within this visit today today - which �taient here � this �poque along which were partag� them exp�riences of these ann�es not declaration never them remember along , which more is , not ago never since known a ceremony effervescence within our countries .
it there ago series something research that us we apprise then : not never Subcommittee - Use the Canada Reorganizationand not never , � the great never , Subcommittee - Use the importance along Day being of the id�e of the Canada for them Canadians along for them people of the world world .
honourable s�nateurs , run it is a remember that I Access of them ann�es House �  , this is the career Stratton of positive which themselves d�gageait of across along which impr�gnait everyone a each .
the matter �tait the requires own along the of la seen of the Canada fact break along within his hearts within the world .
� Day r�flexion , I me pay now account of the power �norme of a becomes Stratton of seen along of positive thus that of la concern increase of �nergie that it can �tre for a countries along his Columbians .
today today , I not cannot me emp�cher of consid�rer Day strength of the Canada Reorganizationand of his �conomie , the lack of everyone find Covenant of government , justice r�volution �poustouflante which themselves pr�pare within the area of them Social along of la Social thus that Day puissante name of all these serious which , together , not can that am�liorer Day qualit� along Day foreign of la life of all them Canadians along of them almost management billion of �tres Agriculture which concerns our plan�te , without , a read of more , along still more intens�ment , this m�me positive which me animait when , young Human , I am arriv� Act la Hill of the Parliament .
finally , honourable s�nateurs , I me that � printed of the developed of view of something a which is � the S�nat since tr�s little of time .
i am arriv� here it there ago man little more of a year adequate attendance a new carri�re .
m�me if I sworn a training of counsel , � the during of them p.m. ann�es pr�c�dentes I I �t� a Human of business which themselves is efforc� of b�tir a company exer�ant his activit� � the Canada Reorganizationand elsewhere .
this bad , I I many learned Act them r�alit�s of the considerable of them business along Act the operations of our �conomie .
i I learned that it �tait importance of bringing of them persons the along well form�es within all them have .
i I learned that the exercise is a comp�tence exig�e along appliqu�e � all them levels by whole company prosp�re .
i I learned that Day fiert� �prouv�e respecting � a company along � his products is a cl� research of the succ�s along that Day fiert� that a human �prouve � the �gard of his countries grandit without palliative when our products along services are export�s a little across within the world .
honourable s�nateurs , us must continue of learn the better party of our proximit� along of our links of amiti� along continue of �viter them pi�ges associ�s � them in�galit�s within Day foreign along within the �chelle social .
it fact is thus since that once John G . MacDonald ago fact a premi�re �valuation of our future , along means not ago never �t� also real that today today .
us , Canadians , must remain strong attach�s � our actions along � our identit� .
a soci�t� which not is �prise nor of fairness nor of grounds not cannot r�ellement financial .
however , as them countries of the wonderful are of more fact more �troitement reli�s , us must us focus Act them needs duty of the economy si�cle .
from first , it must that the Canada retain a �conomie along a life cultural more off along more attirantes for capter the int�r�t of them young Canadians along their offer of new encourage .
this is with these atouts that us able them address � living along � do carri�re here , � the Canada .
honourable s�nateurs , I am always anim� of a strong society , which wherever his concern within the enthusiasm along the positive facing I I go�t� here it there ago more of p.m. years , along I not am not the single � grounds that us can them do revivre .

i am tr�s enthousiasm� by Day interest of see his effect along his mind animer the station chairman - to � the during of them next ann�es .
honourable s�nateurs , this is a honour along a privil�ge of participate � Day life public � this �poque of our history , a time o� them d�fis are of setting along them possibilit�s stimulantes , a �re of economy along of years technologique .
us caught opportunity � few weeks of a new mill�naire .
the �poque not is not only exaltante for the countries everyone world , she real also a developed funding for Newfoundland - island along the coastal .
these months months of Estimates revenue everyone ensure a time of arr�t during cetera them Newfoundland - one r�fl�chiront � Day hearts that they leading � the within of the countries along � their encourage of future .
today today , Newfoundland - island along the coastal themselves per within Day tourmente of them centres change China along �conomiques which balayent the world .
business people of Clairvaux r�gion not themselves extra however not just ; they compound call � their comp�tences along � their learning of long valid for do opposite � them r�alit�s of the change quick .
gr�ce � their cr�ativit� , their responsible , their solidarit� , their d�termination along their what � the work , they r�alisent their r�ves along young moving the before their province along their countries .
business relevant �conomiques r�centes us fact saying term Act the �volution of our province .
the property compelling of the Canada took signal� that the plus of growth r�elle of the cent of Newfoundland - island , which themselves �l�ve � 5,2p. per , is the more �lev� � the Canada .
business encourage of jobs themselves am�liorent �galement , because the plus of ch�mage ago diminu� of more of billion CHST since the year last .
business honourable s�nateurs are � the aware of them retomb�es of m�gaprojets as Hibernia , the am�nagement of the during inf�rieur of the Lower along the �ventuelle operating of the the of Voisey' St. Bay .
these centres bills are cruciaux for Day r�ussite �conomique of Newfoundland - island , but the history is far of themselves complete l� .
within all them sph�res of the �conomie , of them soci�t�s of our province remportent of them succ�s of more fact more �clatants .
surely , business build during as the operating mini�re along of them for�ts along them p�ches its of them �l�ments essential � our well - �tre �conomique .
but means not must not do remember Day v�ritable association of lack which ago commenc� � themselves recognized .
from them soci�t�s implant�es home us compound their real within of them areas as them communication , business technical manufacturi�res of leading along Day management of them d�chets dangerous .
honourable s�nateurs , the a of them areas of growth them more substantial � Newfoundland - island , these derni�res ann�es , wrote �t� the together , along Day charged should themselves maintain .
� soir�e hon. � , which conclude Day cash of Newfoundland - island � the Canada fact this cinquanti�me anniversary of his entr�e within Day Conf�d�ration , wrote �t� a �clatant succ�s � the �chelle national .
his festivals , his program along his other activit�s , consumer Day taken . of la around of the CN , the �t� last , were known a work succ�s .
these activit�s were contribu� � pr�parer Day next vast c�l�bration , p millennium , similar of the milli�me anniversary of the arriv�e of them many within the New Parliament .
business Games of Games of the Canada ' Estimates , held � Corner Brook , were also remport� �norm�ment of succ�s .
qualifi�es of the a of them best �ditions of these games , business comp�titions were fact d�couvrir our province � them t�l�spectateurs along � them Gallery of the together of the countries .
the succ�s of them Games of Games of the Canada , honourable s�nateurs , poor the a of them main Armed of Newfoundland - island that I wish � mention , namely the mind g�n�reux , ing�nieux , bienveillant along s of them Newfoundland - one .
reflecting said often that them complete �conomiques not as not , � themselves recommendation , � upon this which fact a vast soci�t� .
the Canada does is not become the great countries that it is today today acting fact reason of his retirement �conomique .
it is �vident that of them political �conomiques base along responsible play a r�le significant , along the government water - neuvien everyone as the government f�d�ral should �tre f�licit�s for their subject within this area .
justice was of our province along of our countries not keeps however not acting � their retirement �conomique .
this which fact of the Canada a countries o� it fact good living , this which the . of them �tats - United , this which fact fact the mountains of the world world , this is Day vast parliamentarian of them Canadians which want understand along prot�ger all them members vuln�rables of their soci�t� , all those which not are not fact extent of take experts of themselves - m�mes .
honourable s�nateurs , it not must never take means � Day l�g�re if us want continue of do the mountains of the my world .
us must aware consider � aviver this vast parliamentarian of them Canadians along never Day allowing themselves �teindre .
this is � Newfoundland - island along � the coastal that these actions are them better illustr�es , honourable s�nateurs .
justice qualit� of life of them Newfoundland - one d�passe whole extent �conomique conventionnelle , because it is contempt of included a price � the mind community , � the requires cultural along � Day grounds .
it not fact nil doubt , honourable s�nateurs , that Day qualit� of life is directly li�e � Day contains g�n�reuse along charitable of a soci�t� .
according the Enqu�te national of 1997 Act the gift , the b�n�volat along Day bringing , business Columbians of Newfoundland - island along of the coastal include still a read among them citizens them more g�n�reux of the Canada .
more of the 33 of la public ago donn� of his time � of them choice of education .
business Newfoundland - one affichaient the more strong rate of cash financi�re � of them organizations of education � the Canada , 84p. per of them Columbians of Newfoundland - island of more of 15 years having fact of them supply for help is .
this g�n�rosit� of mind , p d�pit often of time difficult , is profond�ment enracin�e within the history of Newfoundland - island .
this is similar of people which voice of centres revers since approximately years along that the adversit� and together � the held of them s�parer .
�rosion :
honourable s�nateurs , it themselves going well of them things positive today today � Newfoundland - island along � the coastal , but many of d�fis remain � reported along many of probl�mes , � r�soudre .
it is tr�s consider of see that the government f�d�ral themselves commitment , within the speech of the Tr�ne , � themselves address � these probl�mes .
i wish � speak here of two probl�mes fact particular .
the Prime is the probl�me of the paid of them Newfoundland - one .
many of families of Newfoundland - island along of the coastal were Day sense of see printed of them friend along of them face for of other parts of the Canada Reorganizationand of the world .
the d�clin of la public � the 1 beginning last �tait the more devastating never enregistr� since Day mine of la p�che Act the SUCCESS , , but it is still too �lev� .
it is consider of see that the Prime Minister education along his government are sensibilis�s � this probl�me along d�termin�s � the att�nuer .
it is consider also , honourable s�nateurs , of see that the government f�d�ral themselves commitment , within the speech of the Tr�ne , non only � contribute � remember them young Canadians � the Canada , but also � do whether that the Canada is really the better place o� living � the economy si�cle , a place o� them best along them more best within the left of the world on come living .
the commitment � b of them fund within Day research , business small . along the youth of them comp�tences help address them young of Newfoundland - island along of across � the Canada � remain within their countries for there continue their r�ves .
us we a d�fi the � reported , honourable s�nateurs , Auschwitz of continue � am�liorer Day qualit� of the education dispens� � our young thus that them possibilit�s of there acc�der .
business young Canadians of Newfoundland - island along of elsewhere esp�rent learn the better party of these new possibilit�s for power �tre own .
they not can the do without a help ad�quate fact mati�re of �ducation .
the Universit� community of Newfoundland - island c�l�bre , p Estimates , his cinquanti�me anniversary fact parliamentarian that �tablissement base d�cerner of them dipl�mes .
since tremendous years , the Universit� community ago jou� a r�le road within the d�veloppement of Newfoundland - island along of the coastal .
m�me if the acc�s � a education of qualit� dispens� by the Universit� community along by of other �tablissements university along coll�giaux of the Canada themselves is �largi � the governmental of them years , of many �tudiants of Newfoundland - island along of across � the Canada does can attendance of them �tudes post � suffer of burden financial as the lack of fund along them costs of scolarit� �lev�s .
from many other are oblig�s of drop their �tudes before of them bringing termin�es � suffer of probl�mes as the �norme debt of them �tudiants .
honourable s�nateurs , I known these probl�mes for them bringing v�cus personal .
without Day opportunity tremendous that ago constitu�e for me Day scolarit� gratuite instaur�e within them ann�es 1960 by the Prime Minister main of the �poque along his government , I think that I not pleased not fact extent of do this Robertson � the S�nat today today .
fortunately , good number of them investment which were �t� annonc�s within the speech of the Tr�ne along which points � am�liorer Day productivit� along � stop against the paid of them funding manage orient�s moving them universit�s Forces , � the support of them activit�s of research along d�veloppement within of them areas as them care of sant� along Day high Social .
combin�es � of them seems as the fund of right of them full of �tudes of the mill�naire , these new resources part address � tribute the education education more available � them �tudiants .
for power follow a training avanc�e , business children must power very within a considerable s�r o� their needs basic are say along they must �tre encourag�s � themselves the along � b�n�ficier � the reduced of their �tudes living along high .
as them s�nateurs the know , it there ago fairly of children which living within Day pauvret� � the Canada .
passing it not there had that a single child ample � the Canada , means Honourable malgr� everyone maintained � the tremendous senior Economic of our countries .
if the Canada wants r�ussir Act them professional Economic along �conomique within the future , it him must come � across of la pauvret� home them children .
