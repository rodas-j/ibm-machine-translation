the hon. Lorna Milne :
honourable sï¿½nateurs , I rise today today the speak order the draw the attention of the Sï¿½nat Act the situation ï¿½ commentary are currently confrontï¿½es a sociï¿½tï¿½ individual a young industry Forces .
Kenex Limited , ï¿½ Chatham , in Ontario , is in emerging the become the a the films more centres producers individual transformateurs the hemp industrial .
however , the clarifying the films customs individual the the rï¿½pression the films drugs the films ï¿½tats - United was rï¿½cemment implemented does in pï¿½ril .
i I taken conscience of the problï¿½me aprï¿½s having ï¿½crit in September ï¿½ several the colleagues fax in the sector the the hemp industrial , sooner the me enquï¿½rir Act have crops the Clairvaux annï¿½e .
the rï¿½ponse that I I reï¿½ue the the share of Jean invoking , prï¿½sident the Kenex , not was non ï¿½tï¿½ similar that I the .
Mr. . invoking me was apportï¿½ a help considï¿½rable when I I commencï¿½ ï¿½ me Gregory the the bill the bill Act the hemp industrial .
it me is then restrain ï¿½vident that the marchï¿½ amï¿½ricain affront a good reason for that being authorizes the hemp the the hemp industrial ï¿½ the Canada .
although that the marchï¿½ amï¿½ricain for have products the hemp gross individual deteriorating either trï¿½s significant , are ï¿½tats - United have long banned the hemp the the hemp industrial , the hallmark that , during the films annï¿½es , the marchï¿½ was dï¿½pendu the films imports the the ï¿½tranger .
rï¿½cemment , several ï¿½tats have adoptï¿½ the films laws encouraged the hemp the the hemp industrial - including Hawaii , the Crosby the the North individual the Minnesota .
a read that a grower speaks a share of the marchï¿½ , it was trend ï¿½ deficit amendment advantage downpayment ; it belongs therefore ï¿½ our producers parliamentarians the take individual the deficit their share of marchï¿½ before that have Amï¿½ricains not if the approprient .
the marchï¿½ amï¿½ricain reprï¿½sente would per of the figure the business the Kenex .
the a the his customers , a sociï¿½tï¿½ including the figure the business is the 2 billion the million by year old fuel since the films annï¿½es the films seeds the hemp 73 the China for his mï¿½langes .
the chargement the seeds for the that Kenex was expï¿½diï¿½ in aoï¿½t ï¿½ this sociï¿½tï¿½ was ï¿½tï¿½ picked by have customs amï¿½ricaines .
it chargement ï¿½tait accompagnï¿½ the papers confirmant his stï¿½rilisation individual the analysis the films THC .
Canadian seeds for the are the films ï¿½ seeds the hemp stï¿½rilisï¿½es ï¿½ , which not are not a pantheon rï¿½glementï¿½e , alter that either their Given in THC .
Canadian seeds the hemp the Kenex are across ï¿½ made lï¿½gales ï¿½ have eyes the the bill Canadian .
firms supplements less the 0,001p. per , or a part by per estimated , the THC .
the bill Canadian authorizes until ï¿½ tenths per of THC in have seeds stï¿½rilisï¿½es .
Mr. . invoking was dï¿½clarï¿½ :
it is facet to find the films trace the THC in our products ï¿½ less that the laboratory not either ï¿½quipï¿½ for torch the films testing the prï¿½sence the THC until ï¿½ a part by 1.5 , along still lï¿½ , being any can find the films trace the THC in the most the our products .
Cynthia H .

honourable sï¿½nateurs , before the pose my issue , I like wishing the welcome ï¿½ the Leader of the government ï¿½ the Sï¿½nat .
the life is ï¿½trange .
the derniï¿½re read that I I siï¿½gï¿½ in a chamber with the sï¿½nateur Boudreau , I occupais the siï¿½ge in opposite of the fun .
i ï¿½tais Lahr the the cï¿½tï¿½ the the part self in big that first Minister individual it ï¿½tait the the cï¿½tï¿½ the the Opposition .
i am pleased that we we . in the mï¿½me Position , except that have rï¿½les are renversï¿½s .
i account well calibre with the hon. sï¿½nateur during the separates annï¿½es .
it is possible that it either the is cï¿½tï¿½ - lï¿½ during few annï¿½es , but aprï¿½s have unchanged ï¿½lections fï¿½dï¿½rales , it eliminated me which siï¿½gerai the is cï¿½tï¿½ - lï¿½ individual him the is cï¿½tï¿½ - side .
i am a man trï¿½s sympathetic , along the hon. sï¿½nateur Boudreau the knows .
i like pose ï¿½ the Leader of the government ï¿½ the Sï¿½nat a issue concerning a regarding which him keeps ï¿½ heart individual which me keeps ï¿½ heart since the many annï¿½es .
does was relates ï¿½ the Sociï¿½tï¿½ the dï¿½veloppement the the Cape - Cape , the Devco .
i know that the hon. sï¿½nateur the also strong that the sï¿½nateur Graham for dï¿½fendre the Devco , the the less I the espï¿½re .
my issue whether salt ï¿½ the situation ï¿½ the Westray the coal the Phalen .
being motion in emerging the dï¿½monter the line the - individual cetera levels infï¿½rieurs the the Westray .
Canadian miners espï¿½rent that the social supï¿½rieure the the Westray the Phalen not eliminated not touchï¿½e , because being there wherever still approximately 7,5 million of tonnes of coal including between 5 individual 6 million of tonnes of coal rï¿½cupï¿½rable in have sectors 1A west , 2A west , 1QZ , 2QZ , thereby that 1Y individual 2Y .
the Twenty was the UBC America individual cetera other unions reprï¿½sentï¿½s ï¿½ the Devco espï¿½rent that the government fï¿½dï¿½ral , good the films disturbed patent the Westray ï¿½ the during the films unchanged annï¿½es , sooner that have miners ball calibre a number sufficient the annï¿½es for having right ï¿½ their Superannuation ï¿½ the end the the pï¿½riode the two years .
otherwise , the Westray eliminated fermï¿½e individual cetera workers not defer not right ï¿½ their Superannuation .
the Leader of the government ï¿½ the Sï¿½nat the it , dï¿½s that possible , this issue with the first Minister , sooner that have miners ball continue the calibre ï¿½ the Westray the coal the Phalen individual the patent these 5 ï¿½ 6 million of tonnes of coal rï¿½cupï¿½rable ?
the hon. J . Bernard Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) :
honourable sï¿½nateurs , I thank the sï¿½nateur for his issue .
as the hon. sï¿½nateur we the was contingency well rappelï¿½ , we we dï¿½jï¿½ vï¿½cu a situation similar , except that I Chronicle have issues individual that it connecting have rï¿½ponses .
the sï¿½nateur Buchanan :
it is geographically , along you obteniez still the good rï¿½ponse .
the sï¿½nateur Boudreau :
the hon. sï¿½nateur maxima can - ï¿½tre the situation current more agrï¿½able .
before the rï¿½pondre ï¿½ the question of the hon. sï¿½nateur , I like 209 have comments jokingly across ï¿½ the hour .
it is with many the humilitï¿½ that I I acceptï¿½ have responsabilitï¿½s which me have ï¿½tï¿½ confiï¿½es , the enthusiastic more that my prï¿½dï¿½cesseur have was assumï¿½es the faï¿½on remarkable .
i dï¿½sire the elsewhere the in thank ï¿½ the behalf the the Sï¿½nat individual the the population of the Canada .
honourable sï¿½nateurs , I I ï¿½galement ï¿½tï¿½ trï¿½s touchï¿½ by have words the welcome individual cetera advice that me was prodiguï¿½s the Opposition the the Opposition , which me was proposï¿½ , among other , the reconsidï¿½rer the durï¿½e the my sï¿½jour ï¿½ this vï¿½nï¿½rable institution that is the Sï¿½nat .
i him gallery that , ï¿½ is regarding , it was senator support total of my ï¿½pouse .
in rï¿½ponse ï¿½ the question posï¿½e by the hon. sï¿½nateur Buchanan , I rï¿½pondrai that the Devco eliminated ï¿½ the central of colleagues prï¿½occupations during whole the durï¿½e the my mandate present .
we ceremony all two the closed since a pï¿½riode considï¿½rable .
it made currently the scrutiny the a dï¿½marche in two ï¿½tapes .
the premiï¿½re strategically ï¿½ find a alternative hon. for have resources Resources which working in is sector since the many annï¿½es .
this issue revï¿½t a vast importance only only for these people , but also for all have sï¿½nateurs individual for the government the the Canada .
the other ï¿½tape , although sï¿½r , strategically ï¿½ promote the dï¿½veloppement ï¿½conomique for help the collectivitï¿½ ï¿½ if adapt ï¿½ the Transition in during .
human not knows better that the sï¿½nateur which was posï¿½ the question that it if branch lï¿½ the a lung Transition between a ï¿½conomie industrial which is the the a single employer individual a ï¿½conomie deficit - industrial .
a ceremony Transition not is never easy .
in is which relative the question proprement Prime , I I ï¿½videmment this prï¿½occupation .
i importation however that the dï¿½marche which designed ï¿½ transfï¿½rer have resources ï¿½ a exploitant the the sector privï¿½ is in during .
everyone the world seems if hear for say that it if Glenney the the better faï¿½on the remï¿½dier ï¿½ the situation .
if have resources houillï¿½res V ï¿½tre rï¿½cupï¿½rï¿½es individual exploitï¿½es sï¿½rement , effectively individual ï¿½conomiquement , I am number that the employer exploitant the the sector privï¿½ ï¿½tudiera the proposal trï¿½s sï¿½rieusement .
the sï¿½nateur Buchanan :
honourable sï¿½nateurs , I not agreeing not the the privatization .
i I my own views ï¿½ amendment ï¿½gard .
the problï¿½me that pose have 5 ï¿½ 6 million of tonnes of coal rï¿½cupï¿½rable , it is that , if the branch of Devco contemplating ï¿½ remove the line the - until ï¿½ have sections supï¿½rieures the the houillï¿½re Phalen individual beyond - delï¿½ , it risk the ï¿½tre too later for that a exploitant the the sector privï¿½ diabetes the is coal .
if a exploitant the the sector privï¿½ witty ï¿½ the do , it is trï¿½s well , but it frames then that have miners which vigour is work ï¿½ the during the films two unchanged annï¿½es ball ï¿½tre still eligible ï¿½ have benefits the retirement .
as the hon. sï¿½nateur the knows , with the closure the the Westray Phalen , a great number the miners not are not including in the formula regarding the program the expressions ï¿½ the retirement anticipï¿½e .
the Westray Phalen was fermï¿½ before that human not retain envisagï¿½ his closure individual is is the problï¿½me which we occupied currently .
i like ï¿½galement oath the sï¿½nateur ï¿½ the regarding the films something 1 160 miners which incorporated touchï¿½s by the closure the the Westray Phalen .
the process the ï¿½vincement was dï¿½jï¿½ commencï¿½ with the houillï¿½re Prince .
Canadian men which have ï¿½tï¿½ dï¿½placï¿½s when the Westray Phalen was fermï¿½ individual those which if leading the the maintenance the Clairvaux Westray have ï¿½vincï¿½ have workers the the houillï¿½re Prince , including approximately 250,000 have reï¿½u their notice the implementation ï¿½ foot .
when being sorrow these men - side ï¿½ have other , does made something 1 per miners which not disproportionately neither delivery the retirement , there including those which have 20 annï¿½es the anciennetï¿½ , but which not are not enough ï¿½gï¿½s for having 75 CHST .
i wherever does trï¿½s unfair individual is is is that odd also the prï¿½sident individual cetera members the the exï¿½cutif the the Twenty was the .
it must find a average for tribute these people - lï¿½ eligible ï¿½ the Program the expressions ï¿½ the retirement anticipï¿½e .
a bill is possible individual is citing trï¿½s simple .
the films sï¿½nateurs not coded not that a ï¿½norme opï¿½ration the dï¿½pollution if imposes ï¿½ the Devco .
the mï¿½me something worth for the Sydney Steel Pilots , if it if happened something something lï¿½ - supplies .
the prospect ï¿½ the Devco coï¿½tera approximately 3,150 million of million .
it program is considï¿½rï¿½ ï¿½ the hour current as ï¿½ strong densitï¿½ only not the labour - class Calgarians , but the matï¿½riel .
i ask ï¿½ the new Minister the touch the question raised more tï¿½t possible with the first Minister .
whatever said in bypass , ï¿½ the during the the campaign ï¿½lectorale BST in Nova - ï¿½cosse , the first Minister was adressï¿½ a letter ï¿½ Ms Edna Budden individual ï¿½ have women the films miners their punishing that it belt ï¿½ have officials the the ministï¿½re the review all have aspects of the Program the expressions ï¿½ the retirement anticipï¿½e .
i admirable if it the was fact , but does must ï¿½tre made for that these men not recommend not across simply laissï¿½s for account .
the sï¿½nateur Boudreau :
honourable sï¿½nateurs , as not the admirable not the sï¿½nateur , the program lancï¿½ by the government was ï¿½tï¿½ doubly touchï¿½ by the closure prï¿½maturï¿½e the the Westray .
the foremost , the films people which dropping had right ï¿½ the Program the expressions ï¿½ the retirement anticipï¿½e , because that they preparation reaching the anciennetï¿½ nï¿½cessaire , not have not able there having accï¿½s ï¿½ suffer of the closure prï¿½maturï¿½e the similar - side .
they have lost the time additionnel including they preparation need for if Softwood individual have therefore ï¿½tï¿½ touchï¿½s trï¿½s directly .
thereafter , the program was too ï¿½tï¿½ touchï¿½ because that the sociï¿½tï¿½ Royce Act the income which avoided ï¿½tï¿½ gï¿½nï¿½rï¿½ by the operating of the Westray for this pï¿½riode .
ï¿½ suffer of these two consï¿½quences the the closure prï¿½maturï¿½e the the Westray , the government was estimï¿½ nï¿½cessaire the review the program which had ï¿½tï¿½ proposï¿½ it there was somewhat time ï¿½ have miners individual ï¿½ their families .
promulgated review is still in during .
i I good trust that we able do something something for amï¿½liorer the situation , in particular for have groups including we represent the speak individual which have ï¿½tï¿½ directly touchï¿½s by the closure prï¿½maturï¿½e the the Westray .
i espï¿½re that the first Minister individual cetera ministers intï¿½ressï¿½s bid find a alternative ï¿½ this case .
i I certainly your intï¿½rï¿½t individual guidance comments also well that have rereading .

it was worse impose :
the 116 the the government is still less reluisant today today that it not the ï¿½tait ï¿½ the ï¿½poque the films ï¿½lections ( in 1997 ) consisting
it that have ( Canadians the the Atlantic ) untenable , the sole something that they embrace individual have still demandï¿½e ï¿½ the government fï¿½dï¿½ral , it is a sighted , a aspires numbered that it reconnaï¿½t the problï¿½me individual a ray the hope ... ... ... .
that was fact the government for rï¿½gler these serious problï¿½mes ?
it was composï¿½ 911 individual demandï¿½ the sï¿½nateur Bernie Boudreau .

the films talks are currently in during with the Minister the films Transport respecting ï¿½ have vertically routiï¿½res .
in the speech the the Trï¿½ne , it is issue of films vertically verbal traditional individual the sympathies in the area the films bypass .

it is indï¿½niable that the prospï¿½ritï¿½ gï¿½nï¿½rale which was ï¿½tï¿½ crï¿½ï¿½e in our country is almost without prï¿½cï¿½dent .
the Governor the the Bank the the Canada estimated that the growth the our ï¿½conomie ï¿½ the during the films four defining trimestres is supï¿½rieure ï¿½ aggregate per , it which not if is never seen .
gold , malgrï¿½ this growth remarkable , our rate the inflation left consistent ï¿½ have objectives fixï¿½s - is which constitutes a achievement carelessly .
surely , tariffs achievement not if is not concrï¿½tisï¿½ ï¿½galement in all have rï¿½gions the our country .
Mr. . McKenna wanted can - ï¿½tre do exposure the situation in faï¿½on flamboyante .
i inform however say ï¿½ have honourable sï¿½nateurs that ï¿½ well the films places the the Canada Atlantic , are donnï¿½es Act the crï¿½ation the jobs individual the chï¿½mage deceive clear that the prospï¿½ritï¿½ if is ï¿½tendue .
she not is can - ï¿½tre not also important that we the souhaiterions individual not if can - ï¿½tre not made skyrocketing across , but we bi the dï¿½ployer the films efforts in is sense .

by elsewhere , I conscious trï¿½s well the accidents in issue .
i the I empruntï¿½e ï¿½ dressed opportunities .
the rï¿½seau impact Main the the Nova - ï¿½cosse , which was consumer bï¿½nï¿½ficiï¿½ the the funding the the government fï¿½dï¿½ral , is in enough good ï¿½tat , mï¿½me if it not is not perfect across .
it we must reconnaï¿½tre the rï¿½le that the sï¿½nateur Buchanan was jouï¿½ ï¿½ amendment ï¿½gard .
the province of the Nova - ï¿½cosse possï¿½de a good rï¿½seau impact , but I the rï¿½pï¿½te , it not is however not perfect .
the hon. sï¿½nateur was parlï¿½ the a accidents which nï¿½cessite the films amï¿½liorations .
i not doubt not that the Minister the films Transport epitomizes the the question with his counterpart provincially in this matiï¿½re .
the environment
the Nova - ï¿½cosse - Conformity prospect the films ï¿½tangs bitumeux the Sydney
the hon. Mira Spivak :
honourable sï¿½nateurs , my issue whether directed ï¿½galement ï¿½ the Leader of the government ï¿½ the Sï¿½nat .
it prince remarquï¿½ without doubt that our premiï¿½res issues for the implement ï¿½ the ï¿½preuve together Act the rï¿½gion that it connaï¿½t the better .
i not wear not the Tocqueville Act his habilitï¿½ ï¿½ duck have issues that we him we posï¿½es until ï¿½ now .
numbers the colleagues friends environnementalistes working the Desautels - foot since long for draw the attention of the government Act this issue .
in made , Mr. Don Deleskie , a particular , he mï¿½me made the grï¿½ve the the hunger .
it was distinguished the more , undertaken the dï¿½contaminer have ï¿½tangs ï¿½ the help the a simple pelle .
before that the Minister rï¿½ponde ï¿½ the question , I like him say that , rï¿½cemment , the Sï¿½nat was adoptï¿½ a bill the bill ministï¿½riel which not treating nor the the enlï¿½vement nor the the production of products chemical toxic dangerous as have PCB which if odd in is held contaminï¿½ .
the hon. J . Bernard Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) :
honourable sï¿½nateurs , I thank Cook the sï¿½nateur the his issue .
in made , I thank all have sï¿½nateurs the pose the films issues concerning a rï¿½gion that I conscious enough well .
i conscious well the question of films ï¿½tangs bitumeux the Sydney .
in the passï¿½ , it there was privileged the films stymied the dï¿½contamination the films ï¿½tangs bitumeux .
some the between firms have coï¿½tï¿½ trï¿½s ignorance individual not have not donnï¿½ the These rï¿½sultats .
being cattle dï¿½pensï¿½ many the money for not obtain that the thin rï¿½sultats .
Canadian two dishonour the government , alter that either their affiliation political , have tentï¿½ the impose the films alternatives ï¿½ the collectivitï¿½ .
these stymied have ï¿½galement ï¿½chouï¿½ .
however , this read - side , in the framework the Clairvaux important initiative , the government fï¿½dï¿½ral , with the help the the government provincially , combating something 62 million of million for good is which , we the espï¿½rons , should ï¿½tre the rï¿½glement dï¿½finitif the is problï¿½me .
however , ultimately held the the expï¿½rience the the passï¿½ , expï¿½rience which not ï¿½tait not trï¿½s plaisante or the , it was ï¿½tï¿½ dï¿½cidï¿½ the films participate the collectivitï¿½ ï¿½ the research the a alternative ï¿½ is problï¿½me .
the alternative proposï¿½e wedding the the communautï¿½ .
the problï¿½me with this faï¿½on the films is is that similar - side requires the the time .
it is many more quick the impose a alternative that the solace ï¿½ obtain a consensus ï¿½ the within the the collectivitï¿½ .
by consï¿½quent , a group Joint composï¿½ the reprï¿½sentants the various sectors the the communautï¿½ was ï¿½tï¿½ implemented Act foot .
the government fï¿½dï¿½ral was participï¿½ ï¿½ a program , jointly with the government provincially , along those - side if are engagï¿½s ï¿½ supplier 62 million of million , including 70 per erroneous the the fï¿½dï¿½ral .
a commitment significant rewards ï¿½tï¿½ taken .
the group Joint is Act the developed of complete the premiï¿½re ï¿½tape the his work individual it espï¿½re that the films action corrective bid ï¿½tre taken the more quickly possible .
does worth the worthy the highlight is consensus ï¿½ the within the the communautï¿½ .
i I seen the films case oï¿½ the being cattle optï¿½ for the other alternative individual cetera rï¿½sultats obtained not have not ï¿½tï¿½ trï¿½s palatable .
Canadian principles the the payment by have the , the the prï¿½vention the the pollution individual the the ï¿½limination encroachment the films products chemical toxic - Conformity Position of the government
the hon. Mira Spivak :
honourable sï¿½nateurs , a consensus ï¿½ the within the the communautï¿½ is a something wonderful .
however , in is case - side the responsabilitï¿½ the is which if is happened not can certainly not ï¿½tre imputï¿½e ï¿½ the collectivitï¿½ .
it is the company which was laissï¿½ a gï¿½chis .
ultimately held the the bill the bill that we represent the adopt , the Leader of the government supporting it personally have principles according unspecified the pollueur must pay individual , especially , the ï¿½limination encroachment the the manufacturing , the the production individual the the use the suspicions products chemical toxic , sooner that in the future we not burdened more confrontï¿½s ï¿½ is problï¿½me ?
in bypass , being cattle lost big the time with have alternatives imposï¿½es by the government individual without consensus municipally that the little the time that it compensated for sanity ï¿½ is consensus not is not a regarding the prï¿½occupation .
i like having a idï¿½e the the views of the Minister the the Nova - ï¿½cosse , Leader of the government ï¿½ the Sï¿½nat , debate have principles trï¿½s prominent the the pollueur - payer , the the prï¿½vention the the pollution individual , more significant still , the the ï¿½limination encroachment the the custom individual the the production of the most the films products chemical toxic .
being comes fair the dï¿½couvrir that have whales ï¿½ the wide the the British - British have a rate trï¿½s ï¿½levï¿½ the PCB in their body , it which is connected ï¿½ the production individual ï¿½ the use the many products chemical .
the hon. J . Bernard Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) :
honourable sï¿½nateurs , the involvement local individual the invade the a consensus municipally have ï¿½tï¿½ demandï¿½s ï¿½ have two dishonour the government by the collectivitï¿½ .
the government if is realized ï¿½ these requï¿½tes .
it is a process trï¿½s valid individual nï¿½cessaire , mï¿½me if it ralentit a little have progrï¿½s Act the ground .
for is which is the the other issue soulevï¿½e by the hon. sï¿½nateur , I importation that it was reconsidered per years for Establishing the ï¿½tang the tar .
being any , not a ceremony pollution if hampered today today .
i not I wishes developed of dï¿½saccord majeur with is that was worse the hon. sï¿½nateur .
i like well discuss the is regarding more in depth with her , but nothing the is that her was worse not me to particuliï¿½rement .
we not must never allow that a ceremony situation pertain rï¿½pï¿½te .

Canadian prospects the job if amï¿½liorent ï¿½galement , because the rate the chï¿½mage was diminuï¿½ the more the 2.5 CHST since the year last .
Canadian honourable sï¿½nateurs are ï¿½ the aware the films retombï¿½es the mï¿½gaprojets as Hibernia , the amï¿½nagement the the during infï¿½rieur the the Churchill individual the ï¿½ventuelle operating of the the the Voisey' St. Bay .
these centres bills are cruciaux for the rï¿½ussite ï¿½conomique the Newfoundland - Newfoundland , but the history is far the if complete lï¿½ .
in all have sphï¿½res the the ï¿½conomie , the films sociï¿½tï¿½s the our province remportent the films succï¿½s the more in more ï¿½clatants .
surely , are industries traditional as the operating miniï¿½re individual the films forï¿½ts individual cetera pï¿½ches cartons the films ï¿½lï¿½ments facto ï¿½ our well - ï¿½tre ï¿½conomique .
while does not must not do forget the vï¿½ritable dynamic the diversification which was commencï¿½ ï¿½ if dramatically .
the films sociï¿½tï¿½s implantï¿½es home we troubling their Gallery in the films areas as have bypass , are technical manufacturiï¿½res the prosecution individual the management the films dï¿½chets dangerous .

his festivals , his program individual his other activitï¿½s , consumer the purport lengths the the pavilion the the CN , the ï¿½tï¿½ last , have known a Summer succï¿½s .
these activitï¿½s have contribuï¿½ ï¿½ prï¿½parer the next vast cï¿½lï¿½bration , in 2000 , similar the the milliï¿½me anniversary the the arrivï¿½e the films many in the New Clancy .
Canadian Games the Winter the the Canada ' 99 , properties ï¿½ Corner Brook , have also remportï¿½ ï¿½normï¿½ment the succï¿½s .
qualifiï¿½es the the a the films borrow ï¿½ditions the these games , are compï¿½titions have made dï¿½couvrir our province ï¿½ have tï¿½lï¿½spectateurs individual ï¿½ have Gallery the the together the the country .
the succï¿½s the films Games the Winter the the Canada , honourable sï¿½nateurs , Sen the a the films offers Armed the Newfoundland - Newfoundland that I wish ï¿½ mention , namely the mind gï¿½nï¿½reux , ingï¿½nieux , bienveillant individual warmest the films Newfoundland - one .
being said often that have indicators ï¿½conomiques not as not , ï¿½ themselves structured , ï¿½ illustrate is which made a vast sociï¿½tï¿½ .
the Canada does is not became the great country that it is today today eat in reason the his return ï¿½conomique .
it is ï¿½vident that the films political ï¿½conomiques solid individual responsible invaluable a rï¿½le significant , along the government Naples - neuvien across as the government fï¿½dï¿½ral ought ï¿½tre fï¿½licitï¿½s for their 116 in is area .
the splendour the our province individual the our country not keeps however not eat ï¿½ their return ï¿½conomique .
it which made the the Canada a country oï¿½ it made good live , it which the . the films ï¿½tats - United , it which in made the envy the the world reforming , it is the vast defender the films Canadians which untenable understand individual protï¿½ger all have members vulnï¿½rables the their sociï¿½tï¿½ , all those which not are not in extent the take foreseeable the themselves - mï¿½mes .
honourable sï¿½nateurs , it not must never take does ï¿½ the lï¿½gï¿½re if we want continue the films the envy the the my reforming .
we must aware solace ï¿½ aviver this vast defender the films Canadians individual never the disturbed if ï¿½teindre .
it is ï¿½ Newfoundland - Newfoundland individual ï¿½ the Labrador that these values are have better illustrï¿½es , honourable sï¿½nateurs .
the qualitï¿½ the life the films Newfoundland - one dï¿½passe whole extent ï¿½conomique conventionnelle , because it is facet to Fool a price ï¿½ the mind enhancement , ï¿½ the phrase cultural individual ï¿½ the compassion .
it not made wishes doubt , honourable sï¿½nateurs , that the qualitï¿½ the life is directly liï¿½e ï¿½ the nature gï¿½nï¿½reuse individual charitable the a sociï¿½tï¿½ .
according the Enquï¿½te national the 1997 Act the gift , the bï¿½nï¿½volat individual the involvement , are Columbians the Newfoundland - Newfoundland individual the the Labrador analogous still a read among have citizens have more gï¿½nï¿½reux the the Canada .

Canadian Newfoundland - one affichaient the more strong rate the contribution financiï¿½re ï¿½ the films organizations the charity ï¿½ the Canada , 84p. per of films Columbians the Newfoundland - Newfoundland the more the 15 years having made the films charitable for help is .
this gï¿½nï¿½rositï¿½ the mind , in dï¿½pit often the time difficult , is profondï¿½ment enracinï¿½e in the history the Newfoundland - Newfoundland .
it is similar the people which familiar the centres revers since 2,500 years individual that the adversitï¿½ tie together ï¿½ the held the films sï¿½parer .
ï¿½rosion :
honourable sï¿½nateurs , it if going well the films things positive today today ï¿½ Newfoundland - Newfoundland individual ï¿½ the Labrador , but many the dï¿½fis remaining ï¿½ challenge individual many the problï¿½mes , ï¿½ rï¿½soudre .
it is trï¿½s encouraged the see that the government fï¿½dï¿½ral if endeavour , in the speech the the Trï¿½ne , ï¿½ if poised ï¿½ these problï¿½mes .
i wish ï¿½ speak here the two problï¿½mes in particular .
the first is the problï¿½me the the drain the films Newfoundland - one .
many the families the Newfoundland - Newfoundland individual the the Labrador have the pain the see lasted the films friends individual the films governors for the other parts to the Canada Reorganizationand the the world .
the dï¿½clin the the population ï¿½ the July July last ï¿½tait the more supplies never enregistrï¿½ since the closure the the pï¿½che Act the synagogues Pott , but it is still too ï¿½levï¿½ .
it is encouraged the rebirth that the first Minister Tobin individual his government are sensibilisï¿½s ï¿½ is problï¿½me individual dï¿½terminï¿½s ï¿½ the attï¿½nuer .
it is encouraged also , honourable sï¿½nateurs , the see that the government fï¿½dï¿½ral if endeavour , in the speech the the Trï¿½ne , only only ï¿½ calibre ï¿½ keep have young Canadians ï¿½ the Canada , but also ï¿½ do whether that the Canada is really the better place oï¿½ live ï¿½ the economy siï¿½cle , a place oï¿½ have best individual cetera more brilliant in the left the the world on coming live .
the commitment ï¿½ invest the films fund in the research , are companies . individual the upgrading the films compï¿½tences predictability greatly have young the Newfoundland - Newfoundland individual the across ï¿½ the Canada ï¿½ choices in their country for there pursuing their rï¿½ves .
we we a dï¿½fi the ï¿½ challenge , honourable sï¿½nateurs , Auschwitz the continue ï¿½ amï¿½liorer the qualitï¿½ the the education dispensï¿½ ï¿½ our young thus that have possibilitï¿½s the there accï¿½der .
Canadian young Canadians the Newfoundland - Newfoundland individual the elsewhere espï¿½rent learn the better party the these new possibilitï¿½s for power ï¿½tre own .
they not V the do without a help adï¿½quate in matiï¿½re the ï¿½ducation .
the Universitï¿½ Memorial the Newfoundland - Newfoundland cï¿½lï¿½bre , in 99 , his cinquantiï¿½me anniversary in big that ï¿½tablissement Brunswicker dï¿½cerner the films diplï¿½mes .
since 1950 years , the Universitï¿½ Memorial was jouï¿½ a rï¿½le movements in the dï¿½veloppement the Newfoundland - Newfoundland individual the the Labrador .
mï¿½me if the accï¿½s ï¿½ a education the qualitï¿½ dispensï¿½ by the Universitï¿½ Memorial individual by the other ï¿½tablissements academic individual collï¿½giaux the the Canada if is ï¿½largi ï¿½ the continuously the films years , the many ï¿½tudiants the Newfoundland - Newfoundland individual the across ï¿½ the Canada does V deterred the films ï¿½tudes secondary ï¿½ suffer of barriers financial as the lack the fund individual cetera expense the scolaritï¿½ ï¿½levï¿½s .
the many other are obligï¿½s the abandon their ï¿½tudes before the films having terminï¿½es ï¿½ suffer of problï¿½mes as the ï¿½norme debt the films ï¿½tudiants .
honourable sï¿½nateurs , I conscious these problï¿½mes for have having vï¿½cus personally .
without the fortunate extraordinary that was constituï¿½e for me the scolaritï¿½ gratuite instaurï¿½e in have annï¿½es 1960 by the first Minister Smallwood the the ï¿½poque individual his government , I think that I not originating not in extent the films this surgery ï¿½ the Sï¿½nat today today .
fortunately , good number the films investment which have ï¿½tï¿½ annoncï¿½s in the speech the the Trï¿½ne individual which terminal ï¿½ amï¿½liorer the productivitï¿½ individual ï¿½ struggle against the drain the films drain incorporated orientï¿½s moving have universitï¿½s Forces , ï¿½ the support the films activitï¿½s the research individual dï¿½veloppement in the films areas as have care the santï¿½ individual the upper Science .
combinï¿½es ï¿½ the films initiatives as the Fund the staffing the films Millennium the ï¿½tudes the the millï¿½naire , these new resources part greatly ï¿½ tribute the education post more accessible ï¿½ have ï¿½tudiants .
for power follow a training avancï¿½e , are children must power virtues in a mid sï¿½r oï¿½ their needs basic are satisfied individual they must ï¿½tre encouragï¿½s ï¿½ if the individual ï¿½ bï¿½nï¿½ficier ï¿½ the safeguarded the their ï¿½tudes living individual collateral .
as have sï¿½nateurs the underline , it there was too the children which live in the pauvretï¿½ ï¿½ the Canada .
if it not there had that a single child revelled ï¿½ the Canada , does 9M. malgrï¿½ across invade ï¿½ the extraordinary fabric partnership assistance our country .
if the Canada wants rï¿½ussir Act have illustration partnership individual ï¿½conomique in the future , it him must coming ï¿½ contradictions the the pauvretï¿½ home have children .
