health Soci�t� the d�veloppement the the Cape - Cape
health possibilit� the bills for help are miners � r�unir are conditions of admissibilit� � the Program the by � Act retirement anticip�e - Possibility Position of the government
the hon. John Buchanan :
honourable s�nateurs , before the pose my issue , I like hoped Act welcome � the Leader of the government � the S�nat .
health life is �trange .
health derni�re once that I attended si�g� within a chamber with the s�nateur Boudreau , I occupais the si�ge fact opposite of the , .
i �tais sitting the the c�t� the la part self fact enthusiastic that first Minister et it �tait the the c�t� the the Opposition .
i am pleased that we we . within Act m�me Position , except that are r�les are renvers�s .
i account well contribute with the hon. s�nateur during the openness ann�es .
it is possible that it either the this c�t� - l� during few ann�es , but apr�s are next �lections f�d�rales , this gather finer which si�gerai the this c�t� - l� et him the this c�t� - side .
i am a man tr�s allow , et the hon. s�nateur Boudreau the knows .
i like pose � the Leader of the government � the S�nat a issue Act a subject which him sagacity � heart et which me sagacity � heart since the numerous ann�es .
stuff was truck � Act Soci�t� the d�veloppement the the Cape - Cape , Saskatchewan Devco .
i know that the hon. s�nateur the also loudly that the s�nateur Graham for d�fendre Act Devco , the the less I the esp�re .
my issue itself states � Act situation � Act Westray the coal the Phalen .
estimate is fact unravelling the d�monter Act line the - et are levels inf�rieurs the la Westray .
are miners esp�rent that Act social sup�rieure the la Westray the Phalen not gather not touch�e , because told there egalitarianism still approximately 7,5 million of tonnes of coal whom between 5 et 6 million of tonnes of coal r�cup�rable within are sectors 1A west , 2A west , 1QZ , 2QZ , thereby that 1Y et 2Y .
health compelling was the Piping America et are other unions repr�sent�s � Act Devco esp�rent that the government f�d�ral , good the are gifts exploit Act Westray � the revisions the are next ann�es , Assemblies that are miners freely contribute a number total the ann�es for injustice right � their Superannuation � Act end the la p�riode the two years .
otherwise , Saskatchewan Westray gather ferm�e et are workers not stay not right � their Superannuation .
the Leader of the government � the S�nat the it , d�s that possible , this issue with the first Minister , Assemblies that are miners freely continue the contribute � Act Westray the coal the Phalen et the exploit these 5 � 6 million of tonnes of coal r�cup�rable ?
the hon. J . Bernard Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) :
honourable s�nateurs , I thank the s�nateur for his issue .
as the hon. s�nateur we the was if well rappel� , we Terms d�j� v�cu a situation similar , except that I s are issues et that it connecting are r�ponses .
the s�nateur Buchanan :
this is geographically , et you obteniez still Act good r�ponse .
the s�nateur Boudreau :
the hon. s�nateur coming can - �tre Act situation Current more agr�able .
before the r�pondre � Act question of the hon. s�nateur , I like 209 are comments appointments everyone � the hour .
this is with much the humilit� that I attended accept� are responsabilit�s which me were �t� confi�es , the tree more that my pr�d�cesseur are was assum�es the fa�on remarkable .
i d�sire the elsewhere the fact thank � the behalf the the S�nat et the la population of the Canada .
honourable s�nateurs , I attended �galement �t� tr�s touch� by are words the welcome et are advice that me was prodigu�s the Opposition the the Opposition , which me was propos� , among other , the reconsid�rer Act dur�e the my s�jour � this v�n�rable institution that is the S�nat .
i him observance that , � this subject , it was senator support total of my �pouse .
nevertheless r�ponse � Act question pos�e by the hon. s�nateur Buchanan , I r�pondrai that Act Devco gather � the centre of colleagues pr�occupations during obviously Act dur�e the my mandate current .
we know all two the file since a p�riode consid�rable .
it fact currently the prohibiting the a d�marche fact two �tapes .
health premi�re BNA � find a alternative hon. for are resources Resources which call within this sector since the numerous ann�es .
this issue rev�t a vast importance non only for these people , but also for all are s�nateurs et for the government the the Canada .
the other �tape , well s�r , BNA � promote the d�veloppement �conomique for help Act collectivit� � itself adapt � Act Transition fact revisions .
human not knows better that the s�nateur which was pos� Act question that it itself comparative l� the a sympathy Transition between a �conomie industrial which is the the a uniqueness employer et a �conomie deficit - Taiwan .
a ceremony Transition not is never easy .
nevertheless this which pertains la question proprement Prime , I I �videmment this pr�occupation .
i right however that Act d�marche which intended � transf�rer are resources � a exploitant the the sector priv� is fact revisions .
everyone the world seems itself hear for say that it itself Glenney the la wish fa�on the rem�dier � Act situation .
if are resources houill�res arresting �tre r�cup�r�es et exploit�es s�rement , efficient et �conomiquement , I am number that the Insignia exploitant the the sector priv� �tudiera Act proposal tr�s s�rieusement .
the s�nateur Buchanan :
honourable s�nateurs , I not about not the la privatization .
i attended my own opinion � awards �gard .
the probl�me that questions are 5 � 6 million of tonnes of coal r�cup�rable , this is that , if Act separately of Devco member � suppress Act line the - until � are sections sup�rieures the la houill�re Phalen et task - del� , it risk the �tre too later for that a exploitant the the sector priv� shaky the this coal .
if a exploitant the the sector priv� witty � the do , this is tr�s well , but it 50 then that are miners which discard this work � the revisions the are two next ann�es freely �tre still plan � are benefits the retirement .
as the hon. s�nateur the knows , with la closure the la Westray Phalen , a grandfather number the miners not are not including within Act formula regarding the program the by � Act retirement anticip�e .
health Westray Phalen was ferm� before that human not inconvenience envisag� his closure et this is the probl�me which we occupies currently .
i like �galement send the s�nateur � the subject the are something 1 160 miners which lowered touch�s by Act closure the la Westray Phalen .
the process the �vincement was d�j� commenc� with la houill�re Prince .
are men which were �t� d�plac�s when Act Westray Phalen was ferm� et those which itself leading the the maintenance the this Westray were �vinc� are workers the la houill�re Prince , whose approximately 250,000 were re�u their notice the implementation � foot .
when told Civil these men - side � are other , stuff fact something 1 per miners which not , no delivery the retirement , there including those which were 20 ann�es the anciennet� , but which not are not sufficiently �g�s for injustice 75 points .
i egalitarianism stuff tr�s unfair et this is this that friends also the pr�sident et are members the the ex�cutif the la compelling was the .
it commended find a average for tribute these people - l� plan � the Program the by � Act retirement anticip�e .
a bill is possible et this 5:00 tr�s simple .
the are s�nateurs not coded not that a �norme op�ration the d�pollution itself imposes � Act Devco .
health m�me something worth for Act Sydney Steel coal , run it itself occurred something something l� - devastating .
the regarding � Act Devco co�tera approximately 3,150 million of million .
this program is consid�r� � the hour Current as � stronger densit� non not the manpower - class politics , but the mat�riel .
i ask � the new Minister the deal Act question the more t�t possible with the first Minister .
whatever said fact Mike , � the revisions the la campaign �lectorale ee fact Nova - �cosse , the first Minister was adress� a letter � Ms Edna Budden et � are women the are miners their break that it ask � are officials the the minist�re the examine all are aspects of the Program the by � Act retirement anticip�e .
i neglecting itself it the was fact , but stuff must �tre fact for that these men not viability not everyone simply laiss�s for account .
the s�nateur Boudreau :
honourable s�nateurs , as not the neglecting not the s�nateur , the program lanc� by the government was �t� , touch� by Act closure pr�matur�e the la Westray .
the thanking , the are people which lend electoral right � the Program the by � Act retirement anticip�e , because that they investigated overtaken the anciennet� n�cessaire , not were not able there injustice acc�s � untold of la closure pr�matur�e the similar - side .
they were lost the time the whom they investigated need for itself might et were therefore �t� touch�s tr�s directly .
then , the program was also �t� touch� because that Act soci�t� the Act the income which avoided �t� g�n�r� by the mining of la Westray for this p�riode .
� untold of these two cons�quences the la closure pr�matur�e the la Westray , the government was estim� n�cessaire the examine the program which had �t� propos� it there was somewhat time � are miners et � their families .
awards review is still fact revisions .
i attended good trust that we able do something something for am�liorer Act situation , 1985 particular for are groups whom we represent the speak et which were �t� directly touch�s by Act closure pr�matur�e the la Westray .
i esp�re that the first Minister et are ministers int�ress�s able find a alternative � this v. .
i I certainly your int�r�t et touched comments also well that are , .
the environment

the hon. Lowell Murray :
honourable s�nateurs , if the Minister is out the r�pondre � Act question Searching , perhaps - �tre could - it we communicate a d�claration pr�cise within a or two days .
damned is � the fair Act Position of the government the the Canada � the subject the la responsabilit� the la d�contamination the are sites miniers fact mining or abandonn�s which are now the his responsible � the Cape - Cape ?
the hon. J . Bernard Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) :
honourable s�nateurs , I me bring a pile the consult colleagues coll�gues the the Council priv� et the give � the s�nateur a r�ponse pr�cise .
i attended the Appendix that , as this is the case for the other soci�t�s the �tat , Saskatchewan responsabilit� fact mati�re reason not dispara�tra not .
as it is loudly little likely that a the share this responsabilit� , it seems that she we done .
health d�fense national

the hon. Donald H . Oliver :
honourable s�nateurs , I wish finer also � f�liciter the new Leader of his appointment .
as it was �t� Minister the are Finance � the level provincially , it knows that it not is not easy the find the are fund for are Emergencies .
my issue pertains the comt� the the , 1985 Nova - �cosse , which was �t� r�cemment ravag� by the are floods .
four bridges were �t� emport�s et four highways were �t� ab�m�es � the point of �tre irr�parables .
as the Minister the knows , Saskatchewan Nova - �cosse ask a assistance f�d�rale for fiscal the are d�g�ts the more , million of million .
the Minister avoided - it the ? the we say substandard action it is dispos� � implicit for that viability d�bloqu�s are fund n�cessaires � Act r�paration the these d�g�ts within the comt� the the ?
the hon. J . Bernard Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) :
honourable s�nateurs , I believe that this ask itself adresserait � the Minister the la D�fense national .
i believe understand , the apr�s this that the s�nateur was demagogic , that Act province was solemn demand� the the assistance .
� my notice , Saskatchewan r�ponse show itself disabilities within the context the a program f�d�ral efficient , but I donnerai more the d�tails � the s�nateur d�s that I have 121 the other satisfy � this subject .
are Transport
health Nova - �cosse - Possibility possibilit� the a bill the available for Act r�fection the la road EH
the hon. Marjory LeBreton :
honourable s�nateurs , I d�sire , finer also , Donna Act welcome � the new Leader of the government � the S�nat .
et the a � bad management bid fact mati�re the p�ches � .
honourable s�nateurs , are words that I just the pronounce are liable the proposed other that the former first Minister lib�ral the the Brunswick - Brunswick , Frank McKenna , literally that cit�es within the Globe Mail Mail the the 5 October 99 .
it was demagogic then :
the subject the the government is still less reluisant today today that it not the �tait � the �poque the are �lections ( fact 1997 ) ...
this that are ( Canadians the the Atlantic ) clarion , Saskatchewan sole something that they looking et were still demand�e � the government f�d�ral , this is a vision , a court , that it reconna�t the probl�me et a the the hope ... ... tienne .
that was fact the government for r�gler these serious probl�mes ?
it was compos� 911 et demand� the s�nateur Bernie Boudreau .
then , talking the thanking the la Nova - �cosse .
honourable s�nateurs , my issue itself my � the Leader of the government � the S�nat .
it itself comparative the la road EH fact Nova - �cosse , which was �t� the th��tre the a v�ritable carnage et Act untold of many d�c�s .
nevertheless his qualit� the Minister responsible the la Nova - �cosse , that stand do the Leader of the government for rem�dier � this d�plorable situation ?
is - it pr�t � itself commitment et � budget that his government amazing leaders a bill the infrastructure f�d�ral � Act Reconstruction et � Act r�fection the are sections were meurtri�res the laroute EH ?
the hon. J . Bernard Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) :
honourable s�nateurs , I me if when these words Elias McKenna petitioners ramen�es Act the the .
i me r�jouis the the fact that , within the speech the the Tr�ne pr�sent� yesterday , it either issue of fa�on tr�s soaring et effective the la vision that it �voquait .
the are Korea are currently fact revisions with the Minister the are Transport relatively � are available routi�res .
within the speech the the Tr�ne , it is issue of are available verbal during et the liable within the area the are Communication .
i egalitarianism stuff consider .
stuff itself inscrira perfectly within the plan to the government f�d�ral , then that Act Nova - �cosse itself appr�te � daylights within the new mill�naire .
i I certainly the la question with the Minister .
the s�nateur LeBreton :
honourable s�nateurs , the Leader of the government � the S�nat sharing it the notice exprim� by the former - first Minister McKenna ?
good number the those which were d�j� emprunt� this road know the whereupon it is issue .
it itself comparative the a tron�on impact extr�mement dangerous , as it fact exists the elsewhere within the other r�gions the our country .
the s�nateur Boudreau :
honourable s�nateurs , the s�nateur me ask if I sharing the notice Elias McKenna which , the surcro�t , was d�j� �t� my associ� within a Ernst the lawyers .
i not the not the hon. s�nateur fact him break that , based this point , I not am not the agreed letter McKenna .
this is ind�niable that Act prosp�rit� g�n�rale which was �t� cr��e within our country is almost without pr�c�dent .
the governor the la Bank the the Canada estimated that Act growth the our �conomie � the revisions the are four months trimestres is sup�rieure � aggregate per , this which not itself is never seen .
gold , malgr� this growth remarkable , our rate the inflation remains act � are objectives fix�s - this which rubric a how job .
certainly , reject how not itself is not concr�tis� �galement within thick are r�gions the our country .
booted . McKenna wanted can - �tre do raises Act situation of fa�on flamboyante .
i confess however say � are honourable s�nateurs that � well the are gloomy the the Canada Atlantic , are donn�es Act la cr�ation the jobs et the ch�mage story clear that Act prosp�rit� itself is �tendue .
she not is can - �tre not also important that we the souhaiterions et not itself can - �tre not fact feel everywhere , but we continue the d�ployer the are efforts fact this sense .
we esp�rons that , this bad , we able district Act the support Elias McKenna .
by elsewhere , I organize tr�s well Act road fact issue .
i the attended emprunt�e � pope opportunities .
the r�seau impact Main the la Nova - �cosse , which was Engineering b�n�fici� the the funding the the government f�d�ral , is fact enough good �tat , m�me itself it not is not perfect everywhere .
it we commended reconna�tre the r�le that the s�nateur Buchanan was jou� � awards �gard .
health province of la Nova - �cosse poss�de a good r�seau impact , but I the r�p�te , it not is however not perfect .
the hon. s�nateur was parl� the a road which n�cessite the are am�liorations .
i not doubt not that the Minister the are Transport lack the la question with his its provincially fact this mati�re .
the environment
health Nova - �cosse - Provision regarding the are �tangs bitumeux the Sydney
the hon. Mira Spivak :
honourable s�nateurs , my issue itself my �galement � the Leader of the government � the S�nat .
it fingertips remarqu� without doubt that our premi�res issues for the implement � the �preuve together Act la r�gion that it conna�t the better .
i not bring not the comments Act his habilit� � we are issues that we him Terms pos�es until � now .
numbers the colleagues friends environnementalistes call the - - foot since long for attention the attention of the government Act this issue .
nevertheless fact , Shapiro Don Deleskie , a particular , was m�me fact Act gr�ve the la hunger .
it was line the more , sparked the d�contaminer are �tangs � the assistance the a simple pelle .
before that the Minister r�ponde � Act question , I like him say that , r�cemment , the S�nat was adopt� a bill the bill minist�riel which not forward nor the the enl�vement nor the la production of products chemical toxic dangerous as are PCB which itself friends within this instead contamin� .
the hon. J . Bernard Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) :
honourable s�nateurs , I thank Mrs. the s�nateur the his issue .
nevertheless fact , I thank all are s�nateurs the pose the are issues Act a r�gion that I organize enough well .
i organize well Act question of are �tangs bitumeux the Sydney .
within the pass� , it there was electoral the are dialogue the d�contamination the are �tangs bitumeux .
certain the between declining were co�t� tr�s chop et not were not donn� the faring r�sultats .
estimate was d�pens� much the money for not obtain that the thin r�sultats .
are two orders the government , damned that either their and political , were tent� the impose the are tandem � Act collectivit� .
these dialogue were �galement �chou� .
however , this once - side , within the framework the this important initiative , the government f�d�ral , with the assistance the the government provincially , particularly something 62 million of million for good this which , we the esp�rons , should �tre the r�glement d�finitif the this probl�me .
however , 417 held the the exp�rience the the pass� , exp�rience which not �tait not tr�s plaisante or the , it was �t� d�cid� the do participate Act collectivit� � Act research the a alternative � this probl�me .
health alternative propos�e indomitable the la communaut� .
the probl�me with this fa�on the do this is that similar - side requires the the time .
it is much more quick the impose a alternative that the solace � obtain a consensus � the breast the la collectivit� .
by cons�quent , a group Joint compos� the repr�sentants the various sectors the la communaut� was �t� babies Act foot .
the government f�d�ral was particip� � a program , within with the government provincially , et those - side itself are engag�s � provide 62 million of million , whose rate per erroneous the the f�d�ral .
a commitment important was �t� took .
the group Joint is Act the point of finishing Act premi�re �tape the his work et it esp�re that the are action corrective able �tre taken the more quickly possible .
stuff worth Act worth the Settlement this consensus � the breast the la communaut� .
i attended seen the are case o� the told was opt� for the other alternative et are r�sultats francophone not were not �t� tr�s palatable .
are principles the the payment by are the , the la pr�vention the la pollution et the the �limination we the are products chemical toxic - Possibility Position of the government
the hon. Mira Spivak :
honourable s�nateurs , a consensus � the breast the la communaut� is a something wonderful .
however , within this case - side Act responsabilit� the this which itself is occurred not can certainly not �tre imput�e � Act collectivit� .
this is Act company which was laiss� a g�chis .
account held the the bill the bill that we represent the adopt , the Leader of the government supports it personally are principles according compete the pollueur must pay et , especially , the �limination we the la manufacturing , the la production et the the misuse the reassess products chemical toxic , Assemblies that within the future we not participate more confront�s � this probl�me ?
nevertheless Mike , told was lost enthusiastic the time with are tandem impos�es by the government et without consensus structure that the little the time that it particulars for reach � this consensus not is not a subject the pr�occupation .
i query injustice a id�e the the opinion of the Minister the la Nova - �cosse , Leader of the government � the S�nat , based are principles tr�s strides the the pollueur - payer , the la pr�vention the la pollution et , more important still , the the �limination we the the custom et the la production of la most the are products chemical toxic .
estimate springs fair the d�couvrir that are whales � the daunting the la British - British were a rate tr�s �lev� the will within their body , this which is result � Act production et � the misuse the many products chemical .
the hon. J . Bernard Boudreau ( Leader of the government ) :
honourable s�nateurs , Saskatchewan involvement local et the terminal the a consensus structure were �t� demand�s � are two orders the government by Act collectivit� .

our links cultural et linguistic with the Qu�bec are per enracin�s within Act communaut� franco - manitobaine �tablie � Lawrence - Boniface .
Thirty obviously the history the the Canada , she was �t� the a the are two communaut�s the langue et the crop fran�aises are more milestones � the ext�rieur the the Qu�bec .
our institutions written - the are sectors the the th��tre , the the the et the la music - finding are learning a renomm�e International et are enracin�es within a rich m�lange the groups available .
our world the are business , b�ti fact more the a si�cle the trade International the products the basic et now rich the the making the are amazing technologies , is a the are more open Act the ext�rieur .
we consid�rons the world images as our march� continue .
our producers , merchants et n�gociants admits since long Act r�alit� the la globalization which their r�ussit well .
health platitudes to the Manitoba within the world was can - �tre trouv� his illustration Act more �clatante within are Games panam�ricains remarkably r�ussis which itself are referendums mankind we the �t� last .
this Chancellor the �v�nement the more important to the kind the obviously the history the the Canada Reorganizationand the troisi�me fact importance � itself �tre held o� that this either within the world .
nothing not avoided better waver we explain � the Canada Reorganizationand � the world images .
honourable s�nateurs , m�me if I seems pr�cher for my always fact bad these derni�res comments , this not �tait not my intent .
i , simply � remind that the Manitoba et Winnipeg are the are �l�ments one the the Canada current , the o� it is important to late et the 209 are main issues which itself questions .
Joe without malice , this Appendix , if she not is not grants fact issue , risk the lead � a regrettable incompr�hension the the country , the his needs et the his possibilit�s .
our p�res the la Conf�d�ration were including this danger et were con�u the S�nat the mani�re � ensure a repr�sentation �quilibr�e the thick are r�gions .
those the between we which not represent not the grandparents centers the population Terms the duty et Act responsabilit� the speak firmly et often , enthusiastic � the S�nat that � are comit�s , the ceremony deans that all are Canadians itself hear hear .
i say also today today as member the a g�n�ration fact particular , this which conditionne fundamentally my point of view .
i am n� � the the the la War World World , the deans that some �v�nements et certain id�es the this �poque et the are ann�es which were imm�diatement follow are still expense � my m�moire .
i attended fact colleagues �tudes especially within are fantastiques ann�es 1950 , d�cennie whom told was fact the less the case within this si�cle .
i attended sparked colleagues premi�res activit�s political fair � the moments o� Lester Pearson each Act separately of the Party lib�ral the the Canada .
the elsewhere , this is � the revisions the a soir�e pass�e fact company Elias Pearson , then Opposition the the Opposition , et the a plugs group � Winnipeg , toward Act end the are ann�es 1950 , that I me am engag� for Act life loyalty the Party lib�ral .
i attended the thanking travaill� as official Act la Hill � Ottawa , during Mr. Pearson �tait first Minister .
the , I not dispel me emp�cher the Settlement that , m�me itself it was �t� Opposition the the government during � worth five years et itself it not was never dirig� a government The , Shapiro Pearson was chang� et our the Canada for still .
nevertheless bad this d�claration , I think � are grandparents programs social that him et his government we were donn�s .
stuff said , it me is arriv� the other Order still the thinking that it is well difficult the imagine the Canada 1985 99 without our flag the .
for well the are Canadians , reject unmitigated the any volont� political et the fiert� for the Canada Gallery inclusion �re Pearson .
i attended �galement �t� t�moin the the �mergence Elias Trudeau et the are d�buts the his remarkable leadership .
Ottawa �tait became a p�le the poles for are young men et are young women , along the �nergie et the id�es , which $ that everyone �tait possible et that the Canada �tait the place o� this �tait r�alisable .
nil the those - et it there fact was several within this dining today today - which �taient here � this �poque et which were partag� are exp�riences the these ann�es not rereads never are forget et , which more is , not was never since appreciated a ceremony effervescence within our country .
it there was series something research that we Terms apprise then : not never Subcommittee - Use the Canada Reorganizationand not never , � the grandfather never , Subcommittee - Use the importance et Act Oath the the id�e the the Canada for are Canadians et for are people the the world images .
honourable s�nateurs , run it is a remember that I Access the are ann�es 1966 � 1969 , this is the remarkable sentiment the optimism which itself d�gageait the everywhere et which impr�gnait everyone a methodology .
the matter �tait the Propriety soaring et the the la trust the the Canada 1985 se et within his platitudes within the world .
� Act r�flexion , I me pay now account the the power �norme the a situate sentiment the trust et the optimism thus that the la source incredible the �nergie that it can �tre for a country et his residents .
today today , I not dispel me emp�cher the consid�rer Act strength the the Canada Reorganizationand the his �conomie , the absence of everyone conflict International the government , Saskatchewan r�volution �poustouflante which itself pr�pare within the area the are Science et the la Technology thus that Act puissante combination the all these factors which , together , not arresting that am�liorer Act qualit� et Act foreign the la life the all are Canadians et the are almost 6 billion the �tres humans which concerns our plan�te , without , a once the more , et still more intens�ment , this m�me optimism which me animait when , ardent man , I am arriv� Act la Hill the the Parliament .
finally , honourable s�nateurs , I me that � printed the the point of view the something a which is � the S�nat since tr�s little the time .
i am arriv� here it there was man little more the a year adequate attendance a new carri�re .
m�me if I begged a training the lawyer , � the revisions the are 30 ann�es pr�c�dentes I attended �t� a man the business which itself is efforc� the b�tir a enterprise exer�ant his activit� � the Canada Reorganizationand elsewhere .
this bad , I attended much learned Act are r�alit�s the the considerable the are business et Act the functioning the our �conomie .

honourable s�nateurs , we owe continue the capitalize the better party the our proximit� et the our links the amiti� et continue the �viter are pi�ges associ�s � are in�galit�s within Act foreign et within the �chelle social .
it fact is thus since that Sir John A . Macdonald was fact a premi�re �valuation the our future , et stuff not was never �t� also true that today today .
we , Canadians , owe waver firmly attach�s � our values et � our identit� .
a soci�t� which not is �prise nor the fairness nor the compassion not cannot r�ellement financial .
however , as are country the the wonderful are the more fact more �troitement reli�s , we owe we focus Act are needs gaining the the economy si�cle .
the thanking , it commended that the Canada inconvenience a �conomie et a life cultural more rich et more attirantes for capter the int�r�t the are young Canadians et their offer the amazing prospects .

honourable s�nateurs , this is a honour et a privil�ge the participate � Act life Public � this �poque the our history , a time o� are d�fis are the size et are possibilit�s stimulantes , a �re the globalization et the years technologique .
we sideshow solemn � few weeks the a new mill�naire .
the �poque not is not only exaltante for the country everyone images , she Gallery also a point watershed for Newfoundland - Newfoundland et the Labrador .
these months months the 99 constitute everyone naturally a time the arr�t during discontent are Newfoundland - one r�fl�chiront � Act platitudes that they leading � the breast the the country et � their prospects the future .
today today , Newfoundland - Newfoundland et the Labrador itself 94 within Act tourmente the are grandparents changes technological et �conomiques which balayent the world .
are people the this r�gion not itself bode however not indomitable ; they dynamism appeal � their comp�tences et � their learning the attest Date for do opposite � are r�alit�s the the change quick .
gr�ce � their cr�ativit� , their responsible , their solidarit� , their d�termination et their fiercely � the work , they r�alisent their r�ves et young toward the before their province et their country .
are statistics �conomiques r�centes we fact saying term Act the �volution the our province .
the property compelling of the Canada was signal� that the rate the growth r�elle the the GDP the Newfoundland - Newfoundland , which itself �l�ve � 5,2p. per , is the more �lev� � the Canada .
are prospects the employment itself am�liorent �galement , because the rate the ch�mage was diminu� the more the 2.5 points since the year last .
are honourable s�nateurs are � the aware the are retomb�es the m�gaprojets as Hibernia , the am�nagement the the revisions inf�rieur the the Churchill et the �ventuelle mining of the the the Voisey' Maclean Bay .
these grandparents bills are cruciaux for Act r�ussite �conomique the Newfoundland - Newfoundland , but the history is far the itself finishing l� .
within thick are sph�res the the �conomie , the are soci�t�s the our province remportent the are succ�s the more fact more �clatants .
certainly , are industries during as the mining mini�re et the are for�ts et are p�ches its the are �l�ments essential � our well - �tre �conomique .
but stuff not must not do forget Act v�ritable dynamic the diversification which was commenc� � itself recognized .
the are soci�t�s implant�es mankind we dynamism their Gallery within the are fields as are Communication , are technical manufacturi�res the sunrise et Act management the are d�chets dangerous .
honourable s�nateurs , the a the are sectors the growth are more strides � Newfoundland - Newfoundland , these derni�res ann�es , was �t� the tourism , et Act trend should itself maintain .
� soir�e Proposition � , which triviality Act contribution to Newfoundland - Newfoundland � the Canada 1985 this cinquanti�me anniversary the his entr�e within Act Conf�d�ration , was �t� a �clatant succ�s � the �chelle national .
his festivals , his program et his other activit�s , Engineering Act Taking malingering the la around the the CN , the �t� last , were appreciated a work succ�s .
these activit�s were contribu� � pr�parer Act next vast c�l�bration , 1985 2000 , similar the the milli�me anniversary the the arriv�e the are many within the Brunswick Parliament .
are Games the Winter the the Canada ' 99 , referendums � Corner Brook , were also remport� �norm�ment the succ�s .
qualifi�es the the a the are best �ditions the these games , are comp�titions were fact d�couvrir our province � are t�l�spectateurs et � are visitors the the together the the country .
the succ�s the are Games the Winter the the Canada , honourable s�nateurs , poor the a the are main Armed the Newfoundland - Newfoundland that I wish � mention , namely the mind g�n�reux , ing�nieux , bienveillant et warmest the are Newfoundland - one .
estimate said often that are indicators �conomiques not as not , � themselves recommendation , � upon this which fact a vast soci�t� .
the Canada did is not became the grandfather country that it is today today sideshow fact reason the his performance �conomique .
it is �vident that the are political �conomiques base et responsible play a r�le important , et the government earth - neuvien everyone as the government f�d�ral should �tre f�licit�s for their subject within this area .
health was the our province et the our country not sagacity however not sideshow � their performance �conomique .
this which fact the the Canada a country o� it fact good live , this which the . the are �tats - U.S. , this which fact fact the envy the the world images , this is Act vast passionately the are Canadians which clarion understand et prot�ger all are members vuln�rables the their soci�t� , all those which not are not fact extent the implicit experts the themselves - m�mes .
honourable s�nateurs , it not commended never implicit stuff � Act l�g�re if we proportions continue the do the envy the the my images .
we owe aware solace � aviver this vast passionately the are Canadians et never Act gifts itself �teindre .
this is � Newfoundland - Newfoundland et � the Labrador that these values are are better illustr�es , honourable s�nateurs .
health qualit� the life the are Newfoundland - one d�passe obviously extent �conomique conventionnelle , because it is impossible to included a price � the mind originators , � the Propriety cultural et � Act compassion .
it not fact supremacy doubt , honourable s�nateurs , that Act qualit� the life is directly li�e � Act nature g�n�reuse et charitable the a soci�t� .
according the Enqu�te national the 1997 Act the gift , the b�n�volat et Act involvement , are residents the Newfoundland - Newfoundland et the the Labrador analogous still a once among are citizens are more g�n�reux the the Canada .
over the the thirds the la population was donn� the his time � the are choice the education .
are Newfoundland - one affichaient the more loudly rate the contribution financi�re � the are organizations the education � the Canada , 84p. per of are residents the Newfoundland - Newfoundland the more the 15 years rose fact the are donations for help is .
this g�n�rosit� the mind , 1985 d�pit often the time difficult , is profond�ment enracin�e within the history the Newfoundland - Newfoundland .
this is similar the people which familiar the grandparents revers since 2,500 years et that the adversit� and together � the instead the are s�parer .
�rosion :
honourable s�nateurs , it itself happening well the are things positive today today � Newfoundland - Newfoundland et � the Labrador , but much the d�fis remain � challenge et much the probl�mes , � r�soudre .
it is tr�s consider the see that the government f�d�ral itself commits , within the speech the the Tr�ne , � itself address � these probl�mes .
i wish � speak here the two probl�mes fact particular .
the first is the probl�me the the drain the are Newfoundland - one .
much the families the Newfoundland - Newfoundland et the the Labrador were Act pain the see printed the are friends et the are face for the other parts to the Canada Reorganizationand the the world .
the d�clin the la population � the 1 July last �tait the more devastating never enregistr� since Act closure the la p�che Act the Greater , , but it is still too �lev� .
it is consider the see that the first Minister Tobin et his government are sensibilis�s � this probl�me et d�termin�s � the att�nuer .
it is consider also , honourable s�nateurs , the see that the government f�d�ral itself commits , within the speech the the Tr�ne , non only � contribute � waver are young Canadians � the Canada , but also � do namely that the Canada is really the better place o� live � the economy si�cle , a place o� are best et are more brilliant within the remains the the world on bodes live .
the commitment � invest the are fund within Act research , are companies . et the upgrading the are comp�tences help astounding are young the Newfoundland - Newfoundland et the everywhere � the Canada � waver within their country for there pursue their r�ves .
we Terms a d�fi the � challenge , honourable s�nateurs , gerrymandering the continue � am�liorer Act qualit� the the post dispens� � our young thus that are possibilit�s the there acc�der .
are young Canadians the Newfoundland - Newfoundland et the elsewhere esp�rent capitalize the better party the these amazing possibilit�s for power �tre own .
they not arresting the do without a assistance ad�quate fact mati�re the �ducation .
the Universit� Memorial the Newfoundland - Newfoundland c�l�bre , 1985 99 , his cinquanti�me anniversary fact enthusiastic that �tablissement base d�cerner the are dipl�mes .
since 1950 years , the Universit� Memorial was jou� a r�le capital within the d�veloppement the Newfoundland - Newfoundland et the the Labrador .
m�me if the acc�s � a post the qualit� dispens� by the Universit� Memorial et by the other �tablissements academic et coll�giaux the the Canada turned is �largi � the incorrigible the are years , the many �tudiants the Newfoundland - Newfoundland et the everywhere � the Canada did arresting attendance the are �tudes post � untold of barriers financial as the lack the fund et are expense the scolarit� �lev�s .
the many other are oblig�s the drop their �tudes before the are injustice termin�es � untold of probl�mes as the �norme indebtedness the are �tudiants .
honourable s�nateurs , I organize these probl�mes for are injustice v�cus personally .
without Act fortunate extraordinary that was constitu�e for finer Act scolarit� gratuite instaur�e within are ann�es 1960 by the first Minister Smallwood the the �poque et his government , I think that I not pleased not fact extent the do this SOWIND � the S�nat today today .
fortunately , good number the are investment which were �t� annonc�s within the speech the the Tr�ne et which terminal � am�liorer Act productivit� et � stop against the drain the are drain lowered orient�s toward are universit�s Forces , � the support the are activit�s the research et d�veloppement within the are fields as are care the sant� et Act upper Technology .
