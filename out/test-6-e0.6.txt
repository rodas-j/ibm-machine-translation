la possibilit� of projects for help des way � r�unir des conditions of admissibilit� � M. Program of by � Status retirement anticip�e Island Possibility position of M. government
M. hon. John Buchanan :
honourable s�nateurs , prior of question my issue , I like hoped Status welcome � M. Leader of M. government � M. S�nat .
la life est �trange .
la derni�re read that I I si�g� streets a chamber with M. s�nateur Boudreau , I occupais M. si�ge fact opposite of M. , .
i �tais sitting of M. c�t� of la part policy fact parliamentarian that Prime Minister et he �tait of M. c�t� of M. Opposition .
i am pleased that we we . streets Status m�me position , except that des r�les are renvers�s .
i account well contribute with M. hon. s�nateur during of openness ann�es .
he est possible that he either of this c�t� Island l� during few ann�es , but apr�s des next �lections f�d�rales , this eliminated me who si�gerai of this c�t� Island l� et him of this c�t� Island side .
i am gentleman man tr�s allow , et M. hon. s�nateur Boudreau M. knows .
i like question � M. Leader of M. government � M. S�nat a issue sur gentleman regarding who him keeps � heart et who me keeps � heart since of many ann�es .
means took truck � Status Soci�t� of d�veloppement of M. Corporation Island Tories , la Devco .
i know that M. hon. s�nateur the also strong that M. s�nateur Graham for d�fendre Status Devco , of M. less I M. esp�re .
my issue themselves states � Status situation � Status disaster of coal of future .
reflecting est fact emerging of d�monter Status line of - et des levels inf�rieurs of la disaster .
des way esp�rent that Status social sup�rieure of la disaster of future no eliminated not touch�e , because remembered there wherever still approximately 7,5 million of death of coal whose between 5 et 6 million of death of coal r�cup�rable streets des areas 1A Coast , 2A Coast , 1QZ , 2QZ , thereby that 1Y et 2Y .
la compelling was the Reference America et des other from repr�sent�s � Status Devco esp�rent that M. government f�d�ral , good of des allowing operating Status disaster � M. during of des next ann�es , sooner that des way qualified contribute gentleman number total of ann�es for bringing right � their plans � Status end of la p�riode of two years .
otherwise , la disaster eliminated ferm�e et des workers no stay not right � their plans .
M. Leader of M. government � M. S�nat the he , d�s that possible , this issue with M. Prime Minister , sooner that des way qualified continue of contribute � Status disaster of coal of future et of operating these 5 � 6 million of death of coal r�cup�rable ?
M. hon. J . in Boudreau agreed Leader of M. government ) :
honourable s�nateurs , I thank M. s�nateur for his issue .
as M. hon. s�nateur we M. took if well rappel� , we we d�j� v�cu a situation similar , except that I s des issues et that he the des r�ponses .
M. s�nateur Buchanan :
this est right , et you obteniez always Status right r�ponse .
M. s�nateur Boudreau :
M. hon. s�nateur coming can Island �tre Status situation present more agr�able .
prior of r�pondre � Status question of M. hon. s�nateur , I like speak des comments appointments everything � M. hour .
this est with many of humilit� that I I accept� des responsabilit�s who me were �t� confi�es , of tree more that my pr�d�cesseur des took assum�es of fa�on remarkable .
i d�sire of elsewhere M. fact thank � M. behalf of M. S�nat et of la population of M. Canada .
honourable s�nateurs , I I �galement �t� tr�s touch� Way des words of welcome et des counsel that me took prodigu�s M. Chief of M. Opposition , who me took propos� , between other , of reconsid�rer Status dur�e of my s�jour � this v�n�rable institution that est M. S�nat .
i him draw that , � this regarding , he took M. support total of my �pouse .
accordingly r�ponse � Status question pos�e Way M. hon. s�nateur Buchanan , I r�pondrai that Status Devco eliminated � M. central of my pr�occupations during whole Status dur�e of my mandate present .
we know all two M. file since a p�riode consid�rable .
he fact currently M. subject of a d�marche fact two �tapes .
la premi�re challenge � find a solution hon. for des resources resources who call streets this sector since of many ann�es .
this issue rev�t a vast importance non only for these people , but also for all des s�nateurs et for M. government of M. Canada .
M. another �tape , although s�r , challenge � promote M. d�veloppement �conomique for help Status collectivit� � themselves serving � Status toward fact during .
person no knows better that M. s�nateur who took pos� Status question that he themselves branch l� of a sympathy toward between a �conomie industrial who est the of gentleman single benefits et a �conomie deficit Island Taiwan .
a ceremony toward no est never easy .
accordingly this who relative la question proprement Prime , I I �videmment this pr�occupation .
i right however that Status d�marche who designed � transf�rer des resources � gentleman exploitant of M. sector priv� est fact during .
everything M. world seems themselves hear for say that he themselves the of la wish fa�on of rem�dier � Status situation .
if des resources houill�res can �tre r�cup�r�es et exploit�es s�rement , efficient et �conomiquement , I am number that M. new exploitant of M. sector priv� �tudiera Status proposal tr�s s�rieusement .
M. s�nateur Buchanan :
honourable s�nateurs , I no about not of la privatization .
i I my own view � regard �gard .
M. probl�me that questions des 5 � 6 million of death of coal r�cup�rable , this est that , if Status leadership of Devco member � limit Status line of - until � des sections sup�rieures of la houill�re future et task Island del� , he risk of �tre too later for that gentleman exploitant of M. sector priv� incurred the this coal .
if gentleman exploitant of M. sector priv� so � M. do , this est tr�s well , but he 50 then that des way who agreements this workplace � M. during of des two next ann�es qualified �tre always plan � des benefits of retirement .
as M. hon. s�nateur M. knows , with la mine of la disaster operating , gentleman great number of way no are not including streets Status basic regarding M. program of by � Status retirement anticip�e .
la disaster operating took ferm� prior that person no retain envisag� his mine et this est M. probl�me who we handed currently .
i like �galement send M. s�nateur � M. regarding of des something 1 160 way who manage touch�s Way Status mine of la disaster operating .
M. process of �vincement took d�j� commenc� with la houill�re Island .
des men who were �t� d�plac�s when Status disaster operating took ferm� et those who themselves leading of M. face of Clairvaux disaster were �vinc� des workers of la houill�re Island , whose approximately amount were re�u their notice of implementation � feet .
when remembered Civil these men Island side � des other , means fact something 1 % dock who no , no benefit of retirement , there including those who were 20 ann�es of anciennet� , but who no are not enough �g�s for bringing fifth points .
i wherever means tr�s learned et this est this that friends also M. pr�sident et des members of M. ex�cutif of la compelling was the .
he must find gentleman average for tribute these people Island l� plan � M. Program of by � Status retirement anticip�e .
gentleman project est possible et this citing tr�s simple .
from des s�nateurs no . not that a �norme op�ration of d�pollution themselves thing � Status Devco .
la m�me something worth for Status Sydney Steel coal , run he themselves product something something l� Island devastating .
M. regarding � Status Devco co�tera approximately witness million of million .
this program est consid�r� � M. hour present as � strong densit� non not of document Island class politics , but of mat�riel .
i request � M. new Minister of deal Status question M. more t�t possible with M. Prime Minister .
whatever said fact Mike , � M. during of la campaign �lectorale Comments fact Nova Island �cosse , M. Prime Minister took adress� a letter � Ms Edna Budden et � des women of des way their break that he ask � des servants of M. minist�re of look all des aspects of M.

i know themselves he M. took fact , but means must �tre fact for that these men no recommend not everything simply laiss�s for account .
M. s�nateur Boudreau :
honourable s�nateurs , as no M. know not M. s�nateur , M. program lanc� Way M. government took �t� , touch� Way Status mine pr�matur�e of la disaster .
from first , of des people who lend had right � M. Program of by � Status retirement anticip�e , because that they sons balance M. anciennet� n�cessaire , no were not could there bringing acc�s � suffer of la mine pr�matur�e of similar Island side .
they were lost M. time the whose they sons need for themselves might et were therefore �t� touch�s tr�s directly .
then , M. program took too �t� touch� because that Status soci�t� the sur M. income who avoided �t� g�n�r� Way M. exploitation of la disaster for this p�riode .
� suffer of these two cons�quences of la mine pr�matur�e of la disaster , M. government took estim� n�cessaire of look M. program who had �t� propos� he there took somewhat time � des way et � their families .
regard review est always fact during .
