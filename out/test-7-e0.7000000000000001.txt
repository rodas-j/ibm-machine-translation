P�RIODE the the
la Soci�t� de d�veloppement de M. Corporation - Tories
la possibilit� de projects for help them way � r�unir them conditions de admissibilit� � M. Program de by � la retirement anticip�e - Possibility position de M. government
M. hon. John Buchanan :
honourable s�nateurs , before de question my question , I like hoped la welcome � M. Leader de M. government � M. S�nat .
la life est �trange .
la derni�re read that I I si�g� within a chamber with M. s�nateur Boudreau , I occupais M. si�ge fact opposite de M. , .
i �tais sitting de M. c�t� de la part policy fact parliamentarian that Prime Minister et he �tait de M. c�t� de M. opposition .
i am pleased that we we . within la m�me position , except that them r�les are renvers�s .
i account well contribute with M. hon. s�nateur during de openness ann�es .
he est possible that he either de this c�t� - l� during few ann�es , but apr�s them next �lections f�d�rales , this eliminated me who si�gerai de this c�t� - l� et him de this c�t� - side .
i am a man tr�s allow , et M. hon. s�nateur Boudreau M. knows .
i like question � M. Leader de M. government � M. S�nat a question sur a regarding who him keeps � heart et who me keeps � heart since de many ann�es .
means ago truck � la Soci�t� de d�veloppement de M. Corporation - Tories , la Cape .
i know that M. hon. s�nateur the also strong that M. s�nateur Graham for d�fendre la Cape , de M. less I M. esp�re .
my question themselves states � la situation � la disaster de force de future .
reflecting est fact emerging de d�monter la line de - et them levels inf�rieurs de la disaster .
business way esp�rent that la social sup�rieure de la disaster de future not eliminated not touch�e , because remembered there wherever still approximately 7,5 million de death de force whose between 5 et 6 million de death de force r�cup�rable within them areas 1A Coast , 2A Coast , 1QZ , 2QZ , thereby that 1Y et 2Y .
la compelling was the Reference America et them others from repr�sent�s � la Cape esp�rent that M. government f�d�ral , good de them allowing operating la disaster � M. during de them next ann�es , sooner that them way qualified contribute a number total de ann�es for bringing right � their plans � la end de la p�riode de two years .
otherwise , la disaster eliminated ferm�e et them workers not stay not right � their plans .
M. Leader de M. government � M. S�nat the he , d�s that possible , this question with M. Prime Minister , sooner that them way qualified continue de contribute � la disaster de force de future et de operating these 5 � 6 million de death de force r�cup�rable ?
M. hon. J . in Boudreau agreed Leader de M. government agreed :
honourable s�nateurs , I thank M. s�nateur for his question .
as M. hon. s�nateur we M. ago if well rappel� , we we d�j� v�cu a situation similar , except that I s them questions et that he the them r�ponses .
M. s�nateur Buchanan :
this est right , et you obteniez always la right r�ponse .
M. s�nateur Boudreau :
M. hon. s�nateur coming can - �tre la situation present more agr�able .
before de r�pondre � la question de M. hon. s�nateur , I like speak them comments appointments everyone � M. hour .
this est with many de humilit� that I I accept� them responsabilit�s who me were �t� confi�es , de tree more that my pr�d�cesseur them ago assum�es de fa�on remarkable .
i d�sire de elsewhere M. fact thank � M. name de M. S�nat et de la population de M. Canada .
honourable s�nateurs , I I �galement �t� tr�s touch� by them words de welcome et them counsel that me ago prodigu�s M. Chief de M. opposition , who me ago propos� , between others , de reconsid�rer la dur�e de my s�jour � this v�n�rable institution that est M. S�nat .
i him draw that , � this regarding , he ago M. support guarantee de my �pouse .
accordingly r�ponse � la question pos�e by M. hon. s�nateur Buchanan , I r�pondrai that la Cape eliminated � M. central de my pr�occupations during whole la dur�e de my mandate present .
we know all two M. record since a p�riode consid�rable .
he fact currently M. subject de a d�marche fact two �tapes .
la premi�re challenge � find a solution hon. for them resources resources who call within this sector since de many ann�es .
this question rev�t a vast importance No. only for these people , but also for all them s�nateurs et for M. government de M. Canada .
M. other �tape , although s�r , challenge � promote M. d�veloppement �conomique for help la collectivit� � themselves serving � la toward fact during .
person not knows better that M. s�nateur who ago pos� la question that he themselves branch l� de a sympathy toward between a �conomie industrial who est the de a single benefits et a �conomie deficit - Taiwan .
a ceremony toward not est never easy .
accordingly this who relative la question proprement Prime , I I �videmment this pr�occupation .
i right however that la d�marche who designed � transf�rer them resources � a exploitant de M. sector priv� est fact during .
everyone M. world seems themselves hear for say that he themselves the de la wish fa�on de rem�dier � la situation .
if them resources houill�res can �tre r�cup�r�es et exploit�es s�rement , efficient et �conomiquement , I am number that M. new exploitant de M. sector priv� �tudiera la proposal tr�s s�rieusement .
M. s�nateur Buchanan :
honourable s�nateurs , I not about not de la monopoly .
i I my own view � regard �gard .
M. probl�me that questions them 5 � 6 million de death de force r�cup�rable , this est that , if la leadership de Cape member � limit la line de - until � them sections sup�rieures de la houill�re future et task - del� , he risk de �tre too later for that a exploitant de M. sector priv� incurred the this force .
if a exploitant de M. sector priv� so � M. do , this est tr�s well , but he 50 then that them way who agreements this work � M. during de them two next ann�es qualified �tre always plan � them benefits de retirement .
as M. hon. s�nateur M. knows , with la mine de la disaster operating , a great number de way not are not including within la basic regarding M. program de by � la retirement anticip�e .
la disaster operating ago ferm� before that person not retain envisag� his mine et this est M. probl�me who we handed currently .
i like �galement send M. s�nateur � M. regarding de them something 1 throughout way who manage touch�s by la mine de la disaster operating .
M. process de �vincement ago d�j� commenc� with la houill�re Island .
business men who were �t� d�plac�s when la disaster operating ago ferm� et those who themselves leading de M. face de Clairvaux disaster were �vinc� them workers de la houill�re Island , whose approximately amount were re�u their notice de implementation � feet .
when remembered Civil these men - side � them others , means fact something 1 cent dock who not , no benefit de retirement , there including those who were 20 ann�es de anciennet� , but who not are not enough �g�s for bringing fifth CHST .
i wherever means tr�s learned et this est this that friends also M. pr�sident et them members de M. ex�cutif de la compelling was the .
he must find a average for tribute these people - l� plan � M. Program de by � la retirement anticip�e .
a project est possible et this citing tr�s easy .
de them s�nateurs not . not that a �norme op�ration de d�pollution themselves thing � la Cape .
la m�me something worth for la Sydney Steel coal , run he themselves happened something something l� - devastating .
M. regarding � la Cape co�tera approximately witness million de million .
this program est consid�r� � M. hour present as � strong densit� No. not de document - class politics , but de mat�riel .
i request � M. new Minister de deal la question M. more t�t possible with M. Prime Minister .
whatever said fact Mike , � M. during de la campaign �lectorale Comments fact Nova - �cosse , M. Prime Minister ago adress� a letter � Ms Edna Budden et � them women de them way their break that he ask � them officials de M. minist�re de look all them issues de M. Program de by � la retirement anticip�e .
i know themselves he M. ago fact , but means must �tre fact for that these men not recommend not everyone just laiss�s for account .
M. s�nateur Boudreau :
honourable s�nateurs , as not M. know not M. s�nateur , M. program lanc� by M. government ago �t� , touch� by la mine pr�matur�e de la disaster .
de first , de them people who lend had right � M. Program de by � la retirement anticip�e , because that they sons balance M. anciennet� n�cessaire , not were not could there bringing acc�s � suffer de la mine pr�matur�e de similar - side .
they were lost M. time the whose they sons need for themselves might et were therefore �t� touch�s tr�s directly .
then , M. program ago too �t� touch� because that la soci�t� the sur M. income who avoided �t� g�n�r� by M. operating de la disaster for this p�riode .
� suffer de these two cons�quences de la mine pr�matur�e de la disaster , M. government ago estim� n�cessaire de look M. program who had �t� propos� he there ago somewhat time � them way et � their families .
regard review est always fact during .
i I right seen that we able do something something for am�liorer la situation , p particular for them groups whose we represent de speak et who were �t� directly touch�s by la mine pr�matur�e de la disaster .
i esp�re that M. Prime Minister et them ministers int�ress�s able find a solution � this matter .
i I certainly your int�r�t et your comments also well that them , .

M. hon. J . in Boudreau agreed Leader de M. government agreed :

M. hon. Marjory LeBreton :
honourable s�nateurs , I d�sire , myself also , Donna la welcome � M. new Leader de M. government � M. S�nat .
et de a � concerned management something fact mati�re de p�ches � .
honourable s�nateurs , business words that I just de deal are Right de proposed other that M. former Prime Minister lib�ral de M. New - Money , nominated McKenna , literally that cit�es within M. editor consolidated Mail de M. 5 October 1999 .
he ago demagogic then :
M. subject de M. government est still less reluisant today today that he not M. �tait � M. �poque de them �lections agreed fact 1997 ) ...
this that them agreed Canadians de M. Atlantic agreed want , la miss something that they looking et were always demand�e � M. government f�d�ral , this est a hear , a court , that he reconna�t M. probl�me et a the de hope ... ... tienne .
that ago fact M. government for r�gler these serious probl�mes ?
he ago compos� 911 et demand� M. s�nateur Bernie Boudreau .
then , talking de first de la Nova - �cosse .
honourable s�nateurs , my question themselves my � M. Leader de M. government � M. S�nat .
he themselves branch de la gone possibly fact Nova - �cosse , who ago �t� M. th��tre de a v�ritable carnage et la suffer de many d�c�s .
accordingly his qualit� de Minister responsible de la Nova - �cosse , that stand do M. Leader de M. government for rem�dier � this d�plorable situation ?
est - he pr�t � themselves commitment et � budget that his government putting leaders a project de infrastructure f�d�ral � la build et � la r�fection de them sections were meurtri�res de laroute possibly ?
M. hon. J . in Boudreau agreed Leader de M. government agreed :
honourable s�nateurs , I me if when these words Mr. McKenna bound ramen�es sur M. the .
i me r�jouis de M. fact that , within M. speech de M. Tr�ne pr�sent� yesterday , he either question de fa�on tr�s own et effective de la hear that he �voquait .
de them Korea are currently fact during with M. Minister de them Transport relatively � them available routi�res .
within M. speech de M. Tr�ne , he est question de them available Len during et de Right within M. area de them communication .
i wherever means consider .
means themselves inscrira fully within M. plan de M. government f�d�ral , then that la Nova - �cosse themselves appr�te � remedy within M. new mill�naire .
i I certainly de la question with M. Minister .
M. s�nateur LeBreton :
honourable s�nateurs , M. Leader de M. government � M. S�nat share he M. notice exprim� by M. former - Prime Minister McKenna ?
good number de those who were d�j� emprunt� this gone know de talking he est question .
he themselves branch de a tron�on impact extr�mement dangerous , as he fact exists de elsewhere within de others r�gions de our country .
M. s�nateur Boudreau :
honourable s�nateurs , M. s�nateur me request if I share M. notice Mr. McKenna who , de surcro�t , wrote d�j� �t� my associ� within a practice de lawyers .
i not the not M. hon. s�nateur fact him break that , sur this developed , I not am not de agreed letter McKenna .
this est ind�niable that la prosp�rit� g�n�rale who ago �t� cr��e within our country est almost without pr�c�dent .
M. Governor de la Bank de M. Canada estimated that la growth de our �conomie � M. during de them four months trimestres est sup�rieure � per cent , this who not themselves est never seen .
gold , malgr� this growth remarkable , our rate de inflation remainder act � them objectives fix�s - this who engaged a how job .
surely , tariffs how not themselves est not concr�tis� �galement within all them r�gions de our country .
Mr. . McKenna wanted can - �tre do raises la situation de fa�on flamboyante .
i inform however say � them honourable s�nateurs that � well de them forth de M. Canada Opportunities , business donn�es sur la cr�ation de jobs et M. ch�mage story clear that la prosp�rit� themselves est �tendue .
she not est can - �tre not also important that we M. souhaiterions et not themselves can - �tre not fact feel across , but we continue de d�ployer de them efforts fact this sense .
we esp�rons that , this bad , we able rely sur M. support Mr. McKenna .
by elsewhere , I known tr�s well la gone fact question .

M. r�seau impact Main de la Nova - �cosse , who ago downsizing b�n�fici� de M. funding de M. government f�d�ral , est fact enough good �tat , m�me themselves he not est not throughout across .
he we must reconna�tre M. r�le that M. s�nateur Buchanan ago jou� � regard �gard .
la province de la Nova - �cosse poss�de a good r�seau impact , but I M. r�p�te , he not est however not throughout .
M. hon. s�nateur ago parl� de a gone who n�cessite de them am�liorations .
i not doubt not that M. Minister de them Transport lack de la question with his its Comments fact this mati�re .

M. probl�me with this fa�on de do this est that similar - side require de M. time .
he est many more quick de restrictions a solution that de consider � obtain a consensus � M. within de la collectivit� .

M. hon. Mira Spivak :
honourable s�nateurs , a consensus � M. within de la communaut� est a something wonderful .
however , within this case - side la responsabilit� de this who themselves est happened not can certainly not �tre imput�e � la collectivit� .
this est la company who ago laiss� a g�chis .

accordingly Mike , remembered ago wheelchair parliamentarian de time with them rural impos�es by M. government et without consensus structure that M. little de time that he compensated for reach � this consensus not est not a regarding de pr�occupation .
i like bringing a id�e de M. view de M. Minister de la Nova - �cosse , Leader de M. government � M.

today today , honourable s�nateurs , I like you receive a word de la fa�on whose I do our country - de his pass� , de his pr�sent et certainly de his future , socially that I M. con�ois .
this est for me a honour et a great changes de power take la speak fact r�ponse � M. speech de M. Tr�ne .
as I just de position that I . you do share de my C personal , he est significant that I la i with experts .
since my arriv�e � M. S�nat , I understand better M. v�ritable sense de these as ; then let - me de you d�crire la mani�re - or plut�t them mani�res - whose I per�ois our country .
he there ago totally de first a question de g�ographie , weekly est safety .
i institution � M. central de M. Canada .
m�me if this d�claration can choquer good number de persons within this city , et de many others � Toronto , this est n�anmoins real .
M. central - conceived de Winnipeg not est that � 20 minutes de M. central longitudinal de M. Canada .
this not est not only a singularit� g�ographique , this est �galement a r�alit� must .
means means that he there ago two fuseaux horaires � M. Coast et two et half - reputation three - � M. est .
means means that la moiti� Coast de our province refl�te M. whose foreign et la vast beaut� de them Prairies decreased that similar themselves its � M. est est per ancr�e within M. Bouclier Museum .
reflecting any can living o� I institution , between la Saskatchewan et M. Ontario , without bringing de M. country a example diff�rente de Right that fact were de them persons less favoris�es .
honourable s�nateurs , I me refer de you like de turn that you not confondiez our situation g�ographique with M. the or M. insularit� .
our links cultural et language with M. Qu�bec are per enracin�s within la communaut� franco - manitobaine �tablie � Saint - Boniface .
during whole M. history de M. Canada , she ago �t� M. a de them two communaut�s de fran et de culture fran�aises them more important � M. ext�rieur de M. Qu�bec .
our graduate written - de them areas de M. th��tre , de M. the et de la enjoy - finding are learning a renomm�e internationale et are enracin�es within a raising m�lange de groups available .
our world de them business , b�ti fact more de a si�cle de trade Covenant de products de Basic et now raising de M. making de them new establishing , est a de them more open sur M. ext�rieur .
we consid�rons M. world world as our march� continue .
our producers , 10 et n�gociants include since long la r�alit� de la economy who their r�ussit well .
la hearts de M. Manitoba within M. world ago can - �tre trouv� his ' la more �clatante within them Games panam�ricains rates r�ussis who themselves are held home we M. �t� last .
this naturally M. �v�nement M. more significant de M. kind de whole M. history de M. Canada et M. troisi�me fact importance � themselves �tre held o� that this either within M. world .
none not avoided better word we tell � M. Canada et � M. world world .
honourable s�nateurs , m�me if I seems pr�cher for my always fact bad these derni�res comments , this not �tait not my intended .
i , just � remind that M. Manitoba et Winnipeg are de them �l�ments one de M. Canada present , de o� he est significant de late et de speak them main questions who themselves questions .
Joe without malice , this heart , if she not est not grants fact question , risk de lead � a aware incompr�hension de M. country , de his needs et de his possibilit�s .
our p�res de la Conf�d�ration were including this safe et were con�u M. S�nat de mani�re � ensure a repr�sentation �quilibr�e de all them r�gions .
those de between we who not represent not de centres owned de population we M. build et la responsabilit� de speak strong et often , brilliant � M. S�nat that � them comit�s , de ceremony hallmark that all them Canadians themselves hear hear .
i say also today today as member de a g�n�ration fact particular , this who conditionne origin my developed de view .
i am n� � M. the de la War War World , de hallmark that some �v�nements et some id�es de Clairvaux �poque et de them ann�es who were imm�diatement follow are always costs � my m�moire .
i I fact my �tudes especially within them fantastiques ann�es tremendous , d�cennie whose remembered ago fact M. less de case within this si�cle .
i I began my premi�res activit�s policies just � M. payment o� Lester Pearson each la leadership de M. Party lib�ral de M. Canada .
de elsewhere , this est � M. during de a soir�e pass�e fact company Mr. Pearson , then Chief de M. opposition , et de a growers group � Winnipeg , moving la end de them ann�es tremendous , that I me am engag� for la life shown M. Party lib�ral .
i I de first travaill� as official sur la Hill � Ottawa , during Mr. Pearson �tait Prime Minister .
the , I not cannot me emp�cher de negative that , m�me themselves he ago �t� Chief de M. government during � worth five years et themselves he not ago never dirig� a government The , Mr. Pearson ago chang� et our M. Canada for always .
accordingly bad this d�claration , I think � them centres programs social that him et his government we were donn�s .
means said , he me est arriv� M. other Order still de think that he est well difficult de recognition M. Canada fact 1999 without our flag the .
for well de them Canadians , tariffs offence de any volont� policy et de fiert� for M. Canada real inclusion �re Pearson .
i I �galement �t� t�moin de M. �mergence Mr. Trudeau et de them d�buts de his remarkable exercise .
Ottawa �tait become a p�le de the for them young men et them young women , along de �nergie et de id�es , who $ that everyone �tait possible et that M. Canada �tait M. place o� this �tait r�alisable .
nil de those - et he there fact ago several within this visit today today - who �taient here � this �poque et who were partag� them exp�riences de these ann�es not declaration never them remember et , who more est , not ago never since known a ceremony effervescence within our country .
he there ago series something research that we we apprise then : not never Subcommittee - Use M. Canada et not never , � M. great never , Subcommittee - Use M. importance et la being de M. id�e de M. Canada for them Canadians et for them people de M. world world .
honourable s�nateurs , run he est a remember that I Access de them ann�es House � 1969 , this est M. remarkable Stratton de optimism who themselves d�gageait de across et who impr�gnait everyone a each .
the matter �tait M. requires own et the de la seen de M. Canada fact break et within his hearts within M. world .
� la r�flexion , I me pay now account de M. power �norme de a becomes Stratton de seen et de optimism thus that de la source increase de �nergie that he can �tre for a country et his Columbians .
today today , I not cannot me emp�cher de consid�rer la strength de M. Canada et de his �conomie , M. lack de everyone find Covenant de government , la r�volution �poustouflante who themselves pr�pare within M. area de them Sciences et de la technology thus that la puissante name de all these serious who , together , not can that am�liorer la qualit� et la foreign de la life de all them Canadians et de them almost 6 billion de �tres Agriculture who concerns our plan�te , without , a read de more , et still more intens�ment , this m�me optimism who me animait when , young man , I am arriv� sur la Hill de M. Parliament .
finally , honourable s�nateurs , I me that � printed de M. developed de view de something a who est � M. S�nat since tr�s little de time .
i am arriv� here he there ago man little more de a year adequate attendance a new carri�re .
m�me if I sworn a training de counsel , � M. during de them 30 ann�es pr�c�dentes I I �t� a man de business who themselves est efforc� de b�tir a company exer�ant his activit� � M. Canada et elsewhere .
this bad , I I many learned sur them r�alit�s de M. considerable de them business et sur M. operations de our �conomie .
i I learned that he �tait importance de bringing de them persons the et well form�es within all them have .
i I learned that M. exercise est a comp�tence exig�e et appliqu�e � all them levels by whole company prosp�re .
i I learned that la fiert� �prouv�e relatively � a company et � his products est a cl� research de M. succ�s et that la fiert� that a person �prouve � M. �gard de his country grandit without palliative when our products et services are export�s a little across within M. world .
honourable s�nateurs , we must continue de learn M. better party de our proximit� et de our links de amiti� et continue de �viter them pi�ges associ�s � them in�galit�s within la foreign et within M. �chelle social .
he fact est thus since that Sir John A . MacDonald ago fact a premi�re �valuation de our future , et means not ago never �t� also real that today today .
we , Canadians , must remain strong attach�s � our actions et � our identit� .
a soci�t� who not est �prise nor de justice nor de compassion not cannot r�ellement financial .
however , as them country de M. wonderful are de more fact more �troitement reli�s , we must we focus sur them needs duty de M. economy si�cle .
de first , he must that M. Canada retain a �conomie et a life cultural more off et more attirantes for capter M. int�r�t de them young Canadians et their offer de new encourage .
this est with these atouts that we able them address � living et � do carri�re here , � M. Canada .
honourable s�nateurs , I am always anim� de a strong society , who wherever his source within M. enthusiasm et M. optimism facing I I go�t� here he there ago more de 30 years , et I not am not M. single � grounds that we can them do revivre .

more de M. 33 de la population ago donn� de his time � de them choice de education .
business Newfoundland - one affichaient M. more strong rate de contribution financi�re � de them organizations de education � M. Canada , 84p. cent de them Columbians de Newfoundland - island de more de 15 years having fact de them supply for help is .
this g�n�rosit� de spirit , p d�pit often de time difficult , est profond�ment enracin�e within M. history de Newfoundland - island .
this est similar de people who voice de centres revers since approximately years et that M. adversit� and together � M. held de them s�parer .
�rosion :
honourable s�nateurs , he themselves going well de them things positive today today � Newfoundland - island et � M. coastal , but many de d�fis remain � reported et many de probl�mes , � r�soudre .
he est tr�s consider de see that M. government f�d�ral themselves commitment , within M. speech de M. Tr�ne , � themselves address � these probl�mes .
i wish � speak here de two probl�mes fact particular .
M. Prime est M. probl�me de M. paid de them Newfoundland - one .
many de families de Newfoundland - island et de M. coastal were la sense de see printed de them friend et de them face for de others parts de M. Canada et de M. world .
M. d�clin de la population � M. 1 July last �tait M. more devastating never enregistr� since la mine de la p�che sur M. SUCCESS , , but he est still too �lev� .
he est consider de see that M. Prime Minister education et his government are sensibilis�s � this probl�me et d�termin�s � M. att�nuer .
he est consider also , honourable s�nateurs , de see that M. government f�d�ral themselves commitment , within M. speech de M. Tr�ne , non only � contribute � remember them young Canadians � M. Canada , but also � do whether that M. Canada est really M. better place o� living � M. economy si�cle , a place o� them best et them more best within M. remainder de M. world on come living .
M. commitment � b de them funds within la research , business businesses . et M. youth de them comp�tences help address them young de Newfoundland - island et de across � M. Canada � remain within their country for there continue their r�ves .
we we a d�fi the � reported , honourable s�nateurs , Auschwitz de continue � am�liorer la qualit� de M. education dispens� � our young thus that them possibilit�s de there acc�der .
business young Canadians de Newfoundland - island et de elsewhere esp�rent learn M. better party de these new possibilit�s for power �tre own .
they not can M. do without a assistance ad�quate fact mati�re de �ducation .
M. Universit� community de Newfoundland - island c�l�bre , p 1999 , his cinquanti�me anniversary fact parliamentarian that �tablissement base d�cerner de them dipl�mes .
since tremendous years , M. Universit� community ago jou� a r�le road within M. d�veloppement de Newfoundland - island et de M. coastal .
m�me if M. acc�s � a education de qualit� dispens� by M. Universit� community et by de others �tablissements university et coll�giaux de M. Canada themselves est �largi � M. governmental de them years , de many �tudiants de Newfoundland - island et de across � M. Canada does can attendance de them �tudes post � suffer de burden financial as M. lack de funds et them costs de scolarit� �lev�s .
de many others are oblig�s de drop their �tudes before de them bringing termin�es � suffer de probl�mes as M. �norme debt de them �tudiants .
honourable s�nateurs , I known these probl�mes for them bringing v�cus personal .
without la opportunity tremendous that ago constitu�e for me la scolarit� gratuite instaur�e within them ann�es 60 by M. Prime Minister main de M. �poque et his government , I think that I not pleased not fact extent de do this Robertson � M. S�nat today today .
fortunately , good number de them investments who were �t� annonc�s within M. speech de M. Tr�ne et who points � am�liorer la productivit� et � stop against M. paid de them funding manage orient�s moving them universit�s Forces , � M. support de them activit�s de research et d�veloppement within de them areas as them care de sant� et la high technology .
combin�es � de them seems as M. fund de right de them scholarships de �tudes de M. mill�naire , these new resources part address � tribute M. education education more available � them �tudiants .
for power follow a training avanc�e , business children must power very within a considerable s�r o� their needs basic are say et they must �tre encourag�s � themselves the et � b�n�ficier � M. reduced de their �tudes living et high .
as them s�nateurs M. know , he there ago fairly de children who living within la pauvret� � M. Canada .
passing he not there had that a single child ample � M. Canada , means Honourable malgr� everyone maintained � M. tremendous senior Economic de our country .
if M. Canada wants r�ussir sur them professional Economic et �conomique within M. future , he him must come � across de la pauvret� home them children .
