the SENATE 
Tuesday , February 10 , 1998 
the Senate met at 2:00 p.m. , the Speaker in the Chair . 
prayers . 
the Late Honourable Guy Charbonneau 
tributes 
hon. John Lynch - Staunton ( Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , it is with great sorrow that I learned of Guy Charbonneau ' s death last month . 
although aware of the seriousness of his illness , which had affected him for many months , and of the deterioration that had set in the month before , his death came as a shock nonetheless . 
i knew Guy for over 20 years and held him in high regard from the beginning . 
indeed , I am proud to have been a friend of his . 
our former colleague Guy Charbonneau had many qualities , not the least of which were courage and perseverance . 
it was courage that found him serving with Les Fusiliers Mont - Royal in Europe during World War II. 
it was perseverance that was largely responsible for the victory of his political party in 1984 , a party he served tirelessly for 40 years . 
he was also an educated man , whose great courtesy and modesty served this house so well during his nine years as Speaker , whether in the house , or on official visits abroad . 
the late Senator Charbonneau ' s conduct during the GST debate in the fall of 1990 led to extreme reactions in the Senate , including verbal and even physical abuse , which brought disgrace to this institution and certainly little honour on those who behaved so reprehensibly . 
passions ran high during that period , and no doubt many would not want to be reminded of it today . 
it was a period when the Speaker ' s mettle was put to the test , and Guy Charbonneau met that test with calm and poise , with courage and perseverance . 
it was one of his finest hours as he protected the traditions of the chair from those who were ready to violate them for petty political advantage . 
there was a time , honourable senators , when it was an accusation to say , " He was a friend of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney , " with the hope that the calumny unjustly heaped upon one man would soil the record of another . 
how surely we share the blame for the excesses of those times and the responsibility for the pain that followed . 
does it not remind us that the Speaker of this chamber is provided with no shields to ward off the temper of an agitated house ? 
the Speaker remains silent while the rest of us can make statements that can be appropriately defensive . 
the Speaker remains silent while the rest of us can ask questions when we see or hear unfairness unmasked . 
our Speakers are equipped to defend every senator but themselves . 
who would have thought that Guy Charbonneau would need anyone ' s help ? 
after receiving his Bachelor of Arts from the University of Montreal , he was commissioned in 1942 and served with Les Fusiliers Mont - Royal until 1944 . 
he was promoted to captain in 1944 and named Air Liaison Officer with the French Wing of the Allied Tactical Air Forces in northwest Europe . 
he received the B ' nai Brith Canadian Award of Merit in 1986 , the Grand Croix , Ordre de la Pl � iade in 1991 , and was Commander , Military and Hospitaler Order of St. Lazarus of Jerusalem . 
called to the Senate by Prime Minister Joe Clark in 1979 , he served on four Senate committees until he was named Speaker by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney . 
as Speaker , he also chaired the Internal Economy Committee . 
i will conclude with a quotation from Longfellow which former prime minister Mulroney quoted at the memorial service for Senator Charbonneau : 
the heights by great men reached and kept , 
were not attained by sudden flight ; 
but they , while their companions slept , 
were toiling upward in the night . 
honourable senators , to his wife , Yolande , to his two sons and to his entire family , I offer my deepest sympathy . 
may Guy Charbonneau rest in the peace he so richly deserved . 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , on September 30 last , in this chamber , I paid tribute to Senator Guy Charbonneau on the occasion of his retirement from this place . 
today , such a short time later , we honour our recently deceased colleague , in fact , our longest serving speaker , who had so bravely endured a lengthy illness to the end . 
such courage was much in evidence throughout his life and was no surprise for those who knew of the great distinction with which he served as captain of the proud regiment , Les Fusiliers Mont - Royal , during active service in World War II. 
this was a courage which was a special kind of hallmark for Guy Charbonneau . 
during the 18 years he sat in this chamber , Guy Charbonneau held to his convictions , did not waver in his loyalty , and remained faithful to his party and his country . 
at the very moving memorial to our departed colleague , which I attended only a short time ago in Montreal , the deep feelings he inspired among his friends were very much in evidence , particularly during the eulogy which was given by former prime minister Brian Mulroney . 
a soldier and a gentleman to the end , Guy Charbonneau will always be remembered as a committed , unswerving patriot with a brave and passionate heart . 
to his family , we extend our deepest sympathy . 
hon. Normand Grimard : 
honourable senators , Senator Charbonneau , who died on January 18 , was Speaker of the Senate for the nine years the Conservative government was in office , after having succeeded in the business world through sheer tenacity . 
he was also a dominant figure in the Conservative Party in Quebec City for almost three lean decades . 
our party could not recruit even 600 members in all of Abitibi , Rouyn - Noranda and T � miscamingue . 
as I did on September 30 , 1997 , when the distinguished senator retired from this chamber , already feeling the effects of his terrible illness , I will again point out that my good friend Guy left this world with the satisfaction of an obligation fulfilled in many areas : in his personal and professional life , in business as in politics , and through the constant support he provided to his friends and his family , in particular his wife Yolande , to whom my wife Dolly and I send our special wishes . 
i truly regret that Senator Charbonneau ' s illness prevented him from enjoying the happy retirement wished on each parliamentarian who retires from his duties in this chamber . 
his retirement was so short as to barely have existed . 
god had other plans for him . 
if we were to look for some general phrase to sum up Senator Charbonneau ' s life , I think he would approve of the words spoken by Don Rodrigue in Corneille ' s play Le Cid : 
i would do it all over again if I had to . 
we extend our deepest sympathies to those Senator Charbonneau left behind . 
a wonderful husband , a great parliamentarian and a noble - hearted man - we have lost them all . 
hon. Brenda M. Robertson : 
honourable senators , I was especially saddened by the news of the death of our former colleague the Honourable Guy Charbonneau . 
i shall always remember the first time I met Senator Charbonneau in 1976 . 
it was at the Conservative Party leadership convention where we both worked as volunteers . 
at that time , I was struck by how quietly unassuming he was as he went about his tasks . 
i quickly realized that he was a man who did his job as efficiently as he could without making a big fuss about it . 
during that convention I also learned that Senator Charbonneau had a deep commitment to the political process and to the importance of providing Quebecers with a federal alternative to the Liberal Party . 
when I was named to the Senate , along with Senator Staff Barootes and Senator Finlay MacDonald - we three were appointed on the same day in 1984 - my friendship with Senator Charbonneau was renewed . 
he helped me at a time when I felt out of place and unsure of myself , as I suppose all new senators feel . 
his support and his kindness during those early and also very busy years was important to me . 
through his guidance and his gentle encouragement I soon developed a comfort level with this institution which he continued to enrich until his illness a few years ago . 
i shall miss Senator Charbonneau , but shall always be grateful for the friendship which he wilfully gave . 
i join with my colleagues in expressing to Yolande and his family my deepest sympathy at this time . 
hon. Fernand Roberge : 
he acted as Air Liaison Officer with the Allied Tactical Air Forces in northwest Europe . 
until he became too ill to continue , he was honourary colonel of his regiment . 
guy was a pillar of the Progressive Conservative Party for 50 years . 
i had the privilege of making his acquaintance at the 1976 leadership convention . 
over the following years we worked together , our efforts culminating in Brian Mulroney ' s successful bid for the leadership of our party in 1983 . 
the Prime Minister acknowledged his great competency by appointing him Speaker of the Senate from 1984 to 1993 . His wife Yolande was the soul of generosity and courage right up to the end , and our prayers are with her in these difficult days . 
hon. Serge Joyal : 
honourable senators , if I may , I would like to add my words to the tributes to Senator Charbonneau by my colleagues on the other side of this house . 
i do so because I had the great privilege of having been his successor as the senator for Kennebec , as well as having had the pleasure of his acquaintance for a great many years . 
i would like to pay tribute to his great civility , his great discretion , and in particular to his generous spirit . 
those of us who have been in politics long enough to have had long service within a party know how much courage , generosity and conviction are needed to get through the dark days as well as the bright ones . 
if there is one quality we can particularly associate with Senator Charbonneau , it is his vision that there are periods of grace among the day to day difficulties . 
his portrait in the Speakers ' Gallery attests to that . 
you will have seen , as I have , the determination in his eyes . 
you will have seen that his pose matches the determination he put into meeting all the objectives he set for his life : belief in a united country , family life despite the heavy demands of his political life , and finally the determination that one may , once the daily toils are over , take a well - deserved rest in the twilight of life with the assurance of a job well done . 
hon. Marjory LeBreton : 
honourable senators , I rise today to honour the memory of a friend and colleague , the Honourable Guy Charbonneau , who passed away just over a month ago . 
colleagues in this place are rightfully paying tribute to his very full life and his contribution to his beloved Canada . 
i speak of the human being and how events must surely have made their mark on him . 
no one can deny his loyalty to his country and to his political party . 
i first met him over 30 years ago . 
at the time , being a Progressive Conservative from Quebec was an act of utmost faith and loyalty . 
he was always the optimist and never gave up on our struggle to make our party a truly pan - Canadian one . 
it is to be celebrated that he lived long enough to see this happen . 
like anyone involved in politics , he had his detractors . 
why , even after his death , a Globe and Mail journalist wrote a tasteless dissertation comparing the events of his death to an event in Toronto involving former prime minister Trudeau and the launch of the English version of Cit � Libre . 
i felt that since these two Canadians were the subject of his comparison in The Globe and Mail , perhaps he should have completed the picture . 
both were young French Canadians at the outbreak of World War II. 
one chose to join other Canadians and fight Nazi oppression and to fight for freedom . 
the other , as is well known , chose not to do so . 
upon his death , I reflected on a conversation I had with Guy Charbonneau in late 1990 . 
i was then left to wonder whether , when Guy Charbonneau fought for Canada and for our freedom , including freedom of speech , he ever thought that he would be in this Parliament and have words spoken to him such as , quoting directly from Debates of the Senate back then : 
Mr. Charbonneau is no longer morally our Speaker . 
when he opens his mouth , we will not hear what he says . 
when he decides something , we will not want to know about it . 
when he enters the Senate , we will not see him . 
if he sits again on the Chair , we will only see an empty chair . 
i am sorry to say that Speaker Charbonneau has ceased to exit . 
he is a ghost . 
it is a pity that the person who uttered those words has chosen not to be here at this precise moment . 
or : 
you have been prostituted by two men : 
Lowell Murray sitting there , and Brian Mulroney . 
you , Guy , who have had a distinguished military career , a distinguished business career , have been destroyed in this House by those two individuals . 
i wonder if the thought crossed his mind , as fists were shaken in his face and this place collapsed in a cacophony of whistles and kazoos , that this scene before him did little to dignify all for which he had fought . 
seven and a half years later , most thinking people , and according to surveys , a large majority of Canadians , regret the loss of the Meech Lake Accord , and - what do you know - we still have the GST . 
throughout all of this , Guy Charbonneau maintained his gentlemanly dignity , but his concerns are as valid today as they were then . 
to his wife Yolande , his children and their families , you have my deepest sympathy . 
you have lost a loved one , but you have much to look back on with great pride . 
hon. G � rald - A . 
honourable senators , our colleague Senator Guy Charbonneau passed away in January barely a few months after retiring from the Senate . 
he was in the military in the Second World War and afterward went into business , most successfully . 
i came to know him after my appointment to the Senate in September 1988 . 
the years that followed were turbulent . 
between Christmas and New Year ' s Day , following the 1988 general election , Canada signed the free trade agreement , which came into force on January 1 , 1989 . 
then came the famous debate on the GST , which caused a lot of ruckus . 
speaker Guy Charbonneau kept the ship afloat with courage and determination . 
historians will assess this period of our history . 
he was awarded the Ordre de la Pl � iade in 1991 , among the many other honours he received . 
the death of Senator Guy Charbonneau distresses us all , and I would offer my deepest sympathy to his wife , Yolande , and his family . 
hon. Marcel Prud ' homme : 
honourable senators , I would , very briefly , like to pay tribute to my longtime friend Guy Charbonneau . 
i want to offer my most sincere condolences to his wife . 
i paid final tribute when I attended his funeral service in Montreal along with a number of our colleagues , including you , Mr. Speaker , and the leader of the government . 
i will not repeat what has already been said . 
i will let history judge the unfortunate events in the Senate . 
however , as the Right Honourable Brian Mulroney put it in his tribute at the funeral , Quebec has lost a loving son and Canada , a loyal patriot . 
this is what I want to remember of Guy Charbonneau , and I want it clearly noted . 
the Late Honourable Gerald R . Ottenheimer , Q . C . 
tributes 
hon. John Lynch - Staunton ( Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , the St. John ' s Evening Telegram , in a warm and knowing tribute to our late friend and colleague Gerald Ryan Ottenheimer , noted that he died of cancer at the young age of 63 . 
yes , young indeed . 
well into middle age , he carried with him the sparkle and enthusiasm of a newly - minted president of a junior chamber of commerce ; a man whose enthusiasms and excitements buoyed the spirits of others with him in this place , where sobriety is not the only valued ingredient of second thought . 
the Evening Telegram described that period when Premier Joey Smallwood " was at his most dictatorial " as a " rough introduction to politics for the urbane , civilized Ottenheimer , a man who even his opponents admired for his unfailing good manners . " 
senator Ottenheimer ' s good manners were on display repeatedly in this chamber as in his splendid contribution to the debate on Term 17 of the Terms of Union of Newfoundland in June of 1996 . 
it was a matter on which Senator Ottenheimer had firm convictions . 
still , he found it necessary to allow for the differences of opinion of others , or the possibilities of misunderstandings of what the Newfoundland government was hoping to do with its campaign to eliminate minority rights . 
again and again , Senator Ottenheimer made his own position clear ; there could be no doubt about that . 
he said : 
it is important that the people of Canada know what effect such a precedent might have . 
however , I do not accept that that can be the sole criterion . 
even if it is established - and I do not think it can be established without reasonable doubt - that one can alter the rights of minorities in Newfoundland without their consent without affecting the rights of anyone else as expressed in the Constitution , can that be the criterion of saying the rights of minorities in Newfoundland are less valuable and less protected than the rights of minorities elsewhere ? 
honourable senators , that speech fills most of five pages in the record of the Debates of the Senate , and reflects on the wisdom and experience of a man who had served 16 years and held two portfolios in the Government of Newfoundland . 
to anyone concerned with the role that the Senate plays in the national dialogue , a re - reading of the words of our Speaker pro tempore on that day could be time well invested . 
to his wife Alma , his children and the family , I offer deepest sympathy , with the hope that they will find some consolation in the knowledge that their grief is shared by many who were fortunate not only to know Senator Ottenheimer but to profit from a privileged association . 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
senator Ottenheimer was educated in Rome , Paris , London and New York . 
his love , passion and facility for languages was renowned . 
in spite of his very deep understanding of the global community , his heart and soul belonged to his beloved Newfoundland and , indeed , to Memorial University . 
it was in that wonderful province , a place where European seamen of Basque , Norman and Portuguese descent were fishing in the ice and fog on the Banks a century and a half before the arrival of Cabot , with the Viking presence many centuries before that , that this civilized man of unfailing diplomacy and mannerliness made his home . 
it was in that same wonderful province where the young Gerald Ottenheimer first locked horns with the late Joey Smallwood , one of Canada ' s most colourful Fathers of Confederation . 
the Leader of the Opposition referred to the fact that Senator Ottenheimer was leader of what was then referred to as the " Gang of Three " - Tories to a person , of whom it was said that they could really meet in a phone booth . 
this famous line of his may have to suffice for now : 
i am King of my own little land , and that ' s all I have ever wanted to be . 
honourable senators , there are no nuances in that . 
it took a steel will , great courage and strength of character to force a return to two party politics in that province at a time when , as someone said , " only small game laws protected opposition members in the House of Assembly . " 
without the late Gerry Ottenheimer ' s good work , it has been further said that this may never have happened . 
during his 16 - year tenure in Newfoundland ' s House of Assembly , Senator Ottenheimer served as House Leader , as Minister of Justice and as Minister of Energy . 
he brought his fair - mindedness and enthusiasm to the Canadian Senate upon his appointment here in 1988 . 
in his final days with us as Speaker pro tempore , Senator Ottenheimer continued to serve as the fair and gentle patriot who rarely let partisanship interfere with his duties . 
as an active participant in the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association , he worked hard to keep the process of democratization alive across the globe . 
he and I had many discussions about that . 
he worked hard to keep the dream alive ; the dream and the determination to build a better world . 
he worked hard to inspire the conviction and belief which sustains men and women in the struggle for freedom and human rights . 
he met with and helped advise the many parliamentarians who were setting up democratic institutions in civilian societies across the planet . 
Macaulay once said that the highest intellects , like the tops of the mountains , are the first to catch and to reflect the dawn . 
we were all privileged to serve with Gerry Ottenheimer because he brought much life , urbanity and wisdom to this place . 
however , he was a parliamentary gentleman whose heart remained - unequivocally and always - with the descendants of Europe ' s boldest seamen and fishers : the proud people of Newfoundland . 
to his family , we extend our deepest sympathy . 
hon. C . William Doody : 
honourable senators , I rise with a great deal of sorrow to add a few words to the tributes being paid to our late colleague Gerald Ottenheimer . 
i have known Gerry Ottenheimer for most of my life . 
he was so far ahead of me intellectually , scholastically and in political astuteness , kindness and generosity that it is hard to imagine a better friend and a finer man . 
his academic career was quite remarkable . 
the preceding speakers have mentioned some of his accomplishment in this area . 
he went to Fordham University in New York ; to Memorial Univeristy in St. John ' s ; to the University of Paris , the University of Rome , and Cambridge in the United Kingdom , where he obtained his master ' s degree in law . 
he had an amazing talent for languages , an ability to pick up languages that was quite extraordinary . 
i used to watch him with amazement in the House of Assembly in Newfoundland , taking notes as he listened to speeches from the other side . 
he would take his notes in Greek . 
it was certainly secure , no question about it . 
he also spoke Russian . 
early on , he decided that his vocation was to be politics - or , perhaps more precisely , public service . 
he was first elected to the Newfoundland House of Assembly in 1966 and was re - elected in each subsequent provincial election until 1985 , when he was called to this place . 
as others have mentioned , he served in a number of cabinet positions and served with great distinction as the Speaker of the Newfoundland House of Assembly . 
when Gerry began his political life , before he was first elected , and afterwards , he brought the PC Party to rural Newfoundland for perhaps the first time since Confederation . 
he prepared the way for the Moores and Peckford administrations which subsequently won election . 
Gerry was a pioneer . 
it was a long and lonely road out in rural Newfoundland in those days . 
the cheering throngs of PCs were difficult to find . 
as a matter of fact , they were non - existent . 
he persevered and pressed on with tremendous tenacity , and the results demonstrated themselves . 
Gerry was a man of tremendous accomplishments and talents but , above all , he was a modest man . 
one would be hard pressed , from speaking with him or listening to his conversations , to imagine that he had accomplished so much . 
i can never remember Gerry saying , " When I was at the University of Paris , " or , " When I was at Cambridge . " 
he was far more likely to tell you about a nomination meeting in St. Mary ' s Bay when he was introduced as " Gerry Ockentimer . " 
Ottenheimer is not a name that is easy to pronounce in some of the Irish communities like St. Mary ' s Bay . 
nevertheless , they nominated him , acclaimed him , elected him , and loved him because he was a man among men - and a gentleman above all . 
i was proud to have known him . 
i shall certainly miss him . 
i think we will all miss him . 
i offer my sincere condolences and sympathy to Alma , to his four daughters , to his brother , John , who now serves in the House of Assembly , to his son - in - law , who is currently the PC Party leader in Newfoundland , to all his family , and to his countless friends . 
hon. Bill Rompkey : 
honourable senators , I also want to remember Gerry Ottenheimer . 
there is a line in a song by Joni Mitchell that you may recall : 
you don ' t know what you ' ve got ' til it ' s gone . 
at the commemorative service in St. John ' s it occurred to me that I wished I had got to know Gerry Ottenheimer a lot better . 
as Senator Doody says , he served in a number of cabinet positions , and in the opposition when it was at a low ebb in St. John ' s . 
however , there was a time when the Tory Party was not at a low ebb . 
one of those times was during the Peckford days . 
i think Senator Doody will agree that relations between the Peckford government in St. John ' s and the Trudeau government in Ottawa were perhaps frosty , to understate it . 
perhaps that was the difficulty that accounts for the fact that I did not get to know Gerry better . 
i wish I had . 
i did get to know him better through that commemorative service . 
i got to know him from his wife and his daughters , who have all gone on to have exceptional careers . 
one is doing a Ph . D . in sociology and will be teaching at Memorial University . 
he treasured his daughters and his family . 
he treasured his books . 
his wife told me that he would be careful with each one of them . 
he was a learned man who had a love of learning and books . 
he treasured his roots . 
he was connected with the Ryan family , a historic family of merchants in our province , who lived in Trinity , the historic fishing community . 
he treasured those roots . 
he had a cottage on the sea , on Trinity Bay , which he loved to visit . 
Charlie said they would sit up into the night talking about very deep , thoughtful and philosophical questions . 
i also heard about him from his priest , Father Molloy , who also happened to be a good friend of his . 
Gerry Ottenheimer was a man of faith , a practising Catholic , who went to church regularly when he could in St. John ' s . 
right up to the end , he was in touch with his church , in touch with his priest . 
father Molloy told us that Gerry had made peace with himself and with his maker , and that he was perfectly content to leave the life that he had had , a life of great respect , a life of service , a life of work for other people . 
as a Newfoundlander , I wish to add my voice to Bill Doody ' s to say that we were proud of him . 
he was a dedicated politician . 
he was Speaker pro tempore of this place and he was known internationally . 
i should like to offer him some lines from Stan Rogers , that Nova Scotia balladeer : 
we rise again in the voices of our children . 
we rise again in the laughter of our songs . 
we rise again like the waves on the ocean . 
we rise again . 
we will remember Gerry Ottenheimer and remember him well . 
some Hon. Senators : 
hear , hear ! 
hon. Ethel Cochrane : 
honourable senators , I also was deeply saddened by the loss of Senator Gerry Ottenheimer . 
as a fellow Newfoundlander , as well as a fellow Conservative , I came to know him very well , especially during our years together here in Ottawa . 
like all who knew him , I developed a sincere respect for his intellect and his scholarly approach to the political process and the issues of public policy with which we deal . 
i admired his knowledge of parliamentary procedure and his respect for our traditions . 
i valued his gentlemanly character and his good humour . 
i know that all of his colleagues here , of whatever political persuasion , admired and respected Senator Ottenheimer for those same qualities . 
for over three decades , Gerry Ottenheimer served his party , his province and his country in public life . 
he helped to build the Conservative Party of Newfoundland in the sixties and was first elected to the House of Assembly in 1966 . 
he was Leader of the Opposition from 1967 to 1969 . 
during the 1970 s and 1980 s , he served in Conservative provincial governments as Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Minister of Education , Speaker of the House of Assembly , Minister of Justice and Attorney General , Minister of Labour , Government House Leader , and Minister of Energy . 
since 1987 , he has been a valued member of the Senate , including serving as Deputy Speaker since 1991 . 
the loss of Senator Ottenheimer will be mourned throughout the world - not just here in Canada . 
he was a former chairman of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and maintained contact with legislators in many other countries . 
i recall when I visited Australia last year , I met a number of Australian parliamentarians who knew Gerry and inquired about him . 
during his years in the Senate he served on the Foreign Affairs Committee and maintained an active and scholarly interest in both Canada ' s foreign relations and domestic developments in other countries . 
in addition to his interest and experience in international parliamentary relations , Gerry Ottenheimer spoke at least eight languages . 
because of those skills and experience , he was often called upon to represent the government in meetings with foreign delegations , both here and abroad . 
in effect , he served during the past decade as Canada ' s unofficial ambassador to foreign parliamentarians . 
i am sure that Gerry would be delighted if that was how we were to remember him . 
hon. Marcel Prud ' homme : 
honourable senators , I immediately realized that this distinguished senator was in a class of his own . 
the first time we met , this native of Newfoundland greeted me in perfect French . 
it was clear to me that there was something special about Senator Gerry Ottenheimer . 
i later found out how easy it was for him to pick up new languages . 
i discovered his incredible talent while travelling with him . 
there is one aspect of his life that may have been overlooked and that is his unconditional support for the Meech Lake agreement . 
he was in Newfoundland at the time and I think that , as a French - speaking Quebecer , I must point this out . 
he always told me that it was unfortunate - and in this respect I agree with the people in the party I served so faithfully for 40 years - that the Victoria agreements negotiated by Mr. Trudeau and the Meech Lake accord had failed . 
i got to know him better when I was in Newfoundland with him for the first referendum on the language issue . 
he worked relentlessly , determined to ensure that minority rights would be respected . 
you will recall the speech he gave in the Senate which had a great impact on me ; I am still moved by it . 
i know for a fact that , if he had been here for our last debate on the Quebec school board issue , he and I would have taken a similar stance . 
unfortunately , you know what my circumstances were ; I was unable to attend that debate . 
it was the first time in 34 years . 
incidentally , I was elected 34 years ago today . 
for the first time in 34 years , I was away from Parliament for about 15 days . 
during the difficult times I went through , who do you think was watching over me almost constantly ? 
Gerry Ottenheimer , who was fighting for his own life in Newfoundland . 
i learned from him civility , a taste for excellence and concern for the rights of minorities wherever they are . 
i also travelled with him . 
i had begged him to come to Lebanon and Koweit with me . 
even though he was my guest , I made him the leader of our delegation since he was the Deputy Speaker of the Senate . 
you should have seen him . 
you should have seen Senator Ottenheimer that evening when he told me : " After all , I do not sell arms , I sell peace , understanding and openness . " 
i visited him in Trinity . 
what a privilege it was . 
i got to know his four daughters and his wife , Alma . 
listen to the names of his four daughters : 
g � raldine , Suzanne , Bernadette and Anne - Marie . 
rather impressive , no ? 
four daughters with names like that in Newfoundland . 
today , I want to thank them for making me discover Newfoundland , and also to assure them of my everlasting friendship . 
i will get an opportunity to see them again next summer . 
i could not attend his funeral because I was prohibited from flying . 
hon. P . Derek Lewis : 
honourable senators , as a senator from Newfoundland , I should like to associate myself with and endorse the remarks made by senators with respect to the late Senator Gerald Ottenheimer . 
i do not intend to repeat what has already been said concerning his career and his achievements ; that has been expressed quite well . 
however , I regarded Senator Ottenheimer as a good friend , and I found he and his wife , Alma , to be gracious hosts . 
when he was Minister of Justice in Newfoundland - and , of course , he was a Conservative , whereas I was a supporter of the Liberal Party - I always found him approachable , and receptive to ideas that I might have had with reference to matters concerning the legal profession in the province . 
honourable senators , I must emphasize that Gerry was a good citizen of Newfoundland and Canada , and he will be sorely missed by us all . 
to his wife , Alma , and his family , I extend my deepest sympathy . 
hon. Janis Johnson : 
honourable senators , I , too , wish to add my tribute to those paid to Gerald Ottenheimer and to join my colleagues in expressing my sympathy to Alma and the family , whom I know very well from my days in Newfoundland in the 1970 s . 
Gerald was a unique man . 
he was an excellent cabinet minister , very dedicated to public service , as well as a very learned individual , whose wealth of knowledge I used to admire greatly . 
he could talk about many things , from poetry to history to language , mostly about his latest love , which was learning Russian . 
it was ironic that I inherited Gerry Ottenheimer ' s office when I came to the Senate . 
he moved down the hall to a little larger office , and apologized to me for three years because my office was smaller than his . 
my best times with him and Alma were spent in Trinity Bay at their summer home or in their wonderful house on Waterford Bridge Road . 
their hospitality was wonderful , as my Newfoundland colleagues well know . 
above all , his ability to learn and his constant quest for knowledge was an extraordinary quality . 
his wife will tell you that he always wore out the left shoe of every pair of shoes he ever owned because he would pace whenever he was thinking . 
after he sat down , he would then get up and pace some more . 
alma was always having to buy him new shoes for every occasion . 
it is very sad to lose such a wonderful colleague , someone I have known for 20 years . 
i will always remember Gerry as a devoted Newfoundlander and a true gentleman . 
i will miss him and I will miss our chats about our Senate work and Newfoundland , and I will remember all the things he taught me about my job here . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , please rise for a minute of silence . 
honourable senators then stood in silent tribute . 
senators ' STATEMENTS 
olympic Winter Games 
opening of 1998 Games at Nagano , Japan 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government : 
honourable senators , I think that all of us who heard the wonderful chorus that opened the Nagano Olympics , the glorious chorus of voices in Nagano and the massed choruses around the world which performed the magisterial Ode to Joy - choruses which performed at the Brandenburg Gate , in False Bay near Cape Town , inside the General Assembly Hall of the United Nations , in front of the Forbidden City in Beijing , as well as on the steps of the Sydney Opera House - were overwhelmed by the emotion of the moment . 
on that late afternoon in February , the spirit of a linked world captivated millions across the planet . 
it was hard to imagine that over 50 years ago , with the prospect of an allied invasion of Japan growing , the Imperial family withdrew from Tokyo for a last stand in the snowy mountains outside Nagano . 
as the Eighteenth Winter Olympics opened in the spirit of peace and under the umbrella of the Olympic Truce , it was hard to picture the rubble of several Japanese cities testifying to the devastation and horror of the atomic bomb . 
old conflicts and old wounds were forgotten as we watched the opening celebrations ; as we saw the mixture of high technology and ancient traditions ; as we saw jets soaring overhead and watched 500 - pound Sumo wrestlers stamping out evil spirits ; as we heard the temple bell ring out the first official sound of the opening ceremony from the wonderful Zenkoji Temple , a sacred place that dates back over 1,300 years . 
in Nagano , a magical frame of mind captivated the spectators and the 2,450 athletes from 72 countries as they marched into Minami Stadium , many of them moved by laughter and tears of joy . 
as our all - time largest and most ambitious Winter Olympics contingent of 154 athletes marched proudly with them into that stadium , including 41 previous Olympians , they did so under the overwhelming panorama of an Eastern culture in a place where East and West united ; in a place where the continents of the world were united in the spirit of peace and good will . 
when the final torch relay runners brought the Olympic flame into the stadium , Chris Moon , a British officer who was a victim of a land - mine which exploded when he was helping to remove mines in Mozambique , came with them , a representative of the Land Mine Survivors Network . 
i believe that at that time all Canadians , for obvious reasons , stood just a little taller . 
the Olympics mean many things . 
they are about skating faster and soaring higher ; about a new sport called " boarding , " replete with its own vocabulary ; about rock and roll sports like freestyle skiing . 
they are about the dangerous curves of speed skating and the thrill of a slapshot on open ice in men ' s and women ' s hockey . 
they are about sports with long and proud histories , like the biathlon and curling , and TV - driven events like the aerials . 
the Olympics are about a planet united , about the bonds that bring us together being stronger than those keeping us apart . 
they are about reflection on all those citizens of the world who gathered in Paris 50 years ago to sign the historic Universal Declaration of Human Rights . 
the Nagano Olympics are the last winter games before a new millennium . 
most of all , these games are about the power of the simple , timeless dignity of the human spirit , of the human heart . 
they are about a magical state of mind , about a remarkable power alive and well in the winter air of Japan . 
honourable senators , you do not have to look very far to see it , because that power is us . 
national Defence 
possible Strike by Western Nations Against Iraq - State of Readiness of Troops and Mat � riel 
hon. J . Michael Forrestall : 
honourable senators , as I speak today , an armada of some three aircraft carriers , five destroyers , three frigates , a cruiser , and one attack submarine gather in the Persian Gulf . 
more ships are on their way , including another submarine , a destroyer , an aircraft carrier , a helicopter carrier , a cruiser - primary defence for the carrier group . 
well over 300 aircraft sit at the ready , prepared to strike a deranged and very disturbed dictator . 
Saddam Hussein , armed with weapons of mass destruction , such as VX nerve gas , anthrax , botulinum toxin , and a very large conventional military , threatens his neighbours and the civilized world . 
honourable senators , our closest historic allies and our largest trading partners sit poised to strike to effect the mandate of the United Nations and this government has only a token force to offer in support . 
what has happened to our nation ; a nation which contributed so significantly to past conflicts - World War I , World War II and the Korean War ? 
have we sunk so low that we have virtually nothing to offer ? 
are we a sideshow now among our allies ? 
are we an international afterthought ? 
wither the Canadian forces ? 
so much for the 1994 defence white paper in which many of us placed so much hope . 
i will wager that that white paper is something about which Liberal left - wing thinkers would like to forget . 
i think they were scared by their own defence policy and have failed to implement any of its very urgent and required recommendations ; recommendations such as submarines , replacements for the Sea King , new multi - role support vessels for the navy , 3,000 extra soldiers , new armoured personnel carriers for the Canadian army , upgraded weaponry , and search and rescue helicopters for the Canadian Air Force . 
to date , this government has only recently chosen replacements for the Search and Rescue helicopter fleet , equipped their G - life endangered CF 18 s , and ordered some armoured personnel carriers in the form of the LAVs which we are now beginning to receive . 
the 3,000 troops for the army are in danger of being cut - and indeed are now projected to be cut . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable Senator Forrestall , I regret to have to interrupt you , but your allotted three - minute period is over . 
have you concluded your statement ? 
senator Forrestall : 
no , I have not . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
are you requesting leave to continue ? 
senator Forrestall : 
Yes. 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
is leave granted ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
senator Forrestall : 
honourable senators , I thank you for your indulgence . 
in any event , the whole thing just gets worse . 
my colleagues should glance at least once at chapter 6 of that same National Defence white paper , entitled " Contributing to International Security , " and read therein what is suggested as a possible Canadian contribution to multinational operations such as the one now underway in the Gulf - something of critical importance to this nation and to all responsible nations when a maniac has deadly weapons of mass destruction , has used them in the past and demonstrates a willingness to use them in the future . 
the 1994 Defence white paper says that the Canadian Forces should be prepared to deploy a joint task force comprising one or more of the following units : a naval task force of four ships ; three separate battle groups or a brigade group ; a fighter wing ; a transport squadron , and other personnel to support it . 
what are we offering ? 
perhaps a destroyer . 
we heard today , just a short hour ago , an announcement that one of our new destroyers , together with one aging helicopter and a few land side personnel , are being diverted to the Gulf from assignments elsewhere . 
honourable senators , to have equipment in place takes time . 
we might have been able to get there in time had we had this kind of equipment and support . 
either we continue in a cooperative defence posture with alliances such as NATO and the United Nations and fulfil our role in those undertakings , or we withdraw . 
we cannot have it both ways and expect a continuation of the kind of respect that has been shown in the past for the thousands upon thousands of Canadians who have given their lives in conflicts all over this globe . 
health 
dedication of Medical Profession - Tributes 
hon. Eugene Whelan : 
honourable senators , I wish to take a few moments to pay tribute to the medical profession of this great country of ours : the ambulance attendants , the nurses and the doctors , who all work or are on call 24 hours a day , seven days a week , for their dedication . 
without their dedication , how could we survive ? 
i know this from my own personal experience : 
one year ago today , the doctors , the nurses , the ambulance attendants , my local ambulance squad - which is made up of volunteers , much like a service club - took me from my home to the hospital at Hotel Dieu , Grace , Windsor . 
here again , the emergency staff , the doctors on duty - and we were lucky , because no one was in the emergency room at that time - if they had diagnosed my condition improperly as a heart attack , I would have died . 
however , they diagnosed it properly as a ruptured aorta . 
they then directed me to be taken to the London University Hospital Science Centre . 
there again , we were received by these expert and dedicated people who have no real known hours of duty . 
they are there on call . 
they serve . 
honourable senators , I say to you that without these knowledgeable , caring people , I never would have survived . 
this is my anniversary ; a year ago this day , February 10 , I received this wonderful care . 
the surgery that they performed on me that day was successful . 
i saw the doctor about one week ago in London , Ontario , and he looked at me as though I were a walking miracle . 
to the doctors and the medical staff , the ambulance attendants , and so on , thank you for the job you are doing for all of us in Canada . 
the Late J . B . Salsberg 
tributes 
hon. Jerahmiel S . Grafstein : 
honourable senators , last Sunday The Toronto Star reported that one J . B . Salsberg , Joe Salsberg , aged 95 , died peacefully at his home in Toronto . 
yet J . B . ' s life was anything but peaceful . 
his compelling career mirrored the turbulence and tribulations of Canada in the 20 th century . 
his life serves as a kind of mixed metaphor for the anguish and honour , the travesties and the triumphs , the paradoxes and the passions , the disasters and the dreams of our era . 
following his father ' s wishes , as a youth he studied to become a rabbi . 
with hard work , he earned quick salary increases to $ 5 a week . 
suddenly , the rules changed and he was told that he would now have to work on commission . 
this experience transformed Salsberg into a tribune of the working classes . 
he lifted a torch for labour which he carried from that time until he drew his last breath . 
he always carried the torch with humour and honour . 
while searching for political answers , he joined a Zionist workers ' group and quickly rose to leadership , including the editorship of a newspaper in New York City , speaking to groups across North America . 
this canvas was still not broad enough for Joe ; not broad enough for his ideas or his energy . 
while post - World War I in the 1920 s was booming , the working conditions in Toronto were simply appalling . 
by 1926 , Joe came to believe that communism as a means of eradicating discrimination , eradicating anti - Semitism , encouraging Jewish culture , but above all alleviating the working conditions , was the answer . 
meanwhile , he became a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Canada . 
as a speaker , he would address mass rallies from coast to coast . 
he revelled in the idea that a Jewish immigrant boy from Spadina could be at home organizing miners in Sydney or dock workers in Vancouver . 
Salsberg was invited to secret workers ' meetings across Canada . 
union organizers would conceal him in their homes and churches while his speeches and ideas ignited the passion of key organizers and small worker groups . 
about this time , J . B . married Dora Wilensky , the love of his life . 
she was a pioneer social worker who spearheaded the creation of a Jewish Family and Child Services in Toronto , which became a leader in its field in Canada . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable Senator Grafstein , I am sorry to interrupt you , but your three - minute period has expired . 
senator Grafstein : 
honourable senators , may I have leave to continue ? 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
is leave granted ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
senator Grafstein : 
thank you , senators . 
about this time , he married Dora Wilensky , the love of his life . 
she was a pioneer social worker who spearheaded the creation of the Jewish Family and Child Services in Toronto which became a leader in its field in social work in Canada . 
in 1959 , Dora died prematurely of cancer . 
they had no children , and J . B . never remarried . 
union organizing naturally led to politics , and politics was never the same once J . B . was elected to the Toronto City Council in 1938 . 
he became a tribune of the working classes , and he was re - elected . 
he became Toronto ' s most effective alderman , changing Toronto ' s living and social environment , and , in the process , even the values of his staunchest adversaries . 
in 1943 , he was elected to Queen ' s Park , becoming the lone Communist in the legislature . 
he became an eloquent advocate against discrimination of any kind , and he led the passage of the first bill outlawing discrimination in public places in Canada . 
an inspiring orator , he was usually drowned in a sea of heckling in the legislature . 
once , Salsberg , fed up , threatened to stop asking questions in Question Period , and the premier of the day , Leslie Frost , banned heckling from Question Period . 
frost so admired J . B . ' s eloquence , his wit , his commitment to his ideas , and his integrity that he named a township in Northern Ontario after him . 
j . B . held the seat for the St. Andrew ' s riding until 1955 , when he lost in one of the most bitter electoral campaigns in Canada . 
at the height of the Cold War , J . B . was accused of complacency if not complicity towards Soviet persecution of Jews in Russia . 
when rumour about purges and prosecutions emanated from Stalin ' s Soviet Russia , J . B . remained mute , neither opposing nor defending the horrendous stories seeping out from behind the Iron Curtain . 
j . B . was a true believer . 
after he lost the provincial election , he travelled to Moscow in 1956 to learn firsthand the fate of Jews and others at the hand of the Soviet state . 
this included an angry confrontation with Nikita Khruschev himself in the Kremlin . 
in 1957 , returning to Toronto disillusioned , he denounced Communism . 
as the number two person in the Communist Party in Canada , he left the party and took half the national executive with him . 
this effectively destroyed the Communist Party in Canada forever . 
supporters of all parties then wanted J . B . to run for them , but Joe had had enough of politics . 
Joe ' s heart was broken . 
he turned to business and community affairs . 
he did volunteer social work , volunteer labour work , and became a leading figure of local Jewish culture and worker ' s causes , writing a regular column for the Canadian Jewish News . 
Joe knew each member of my family intimately . 
it was in this latter capacity that I came to know and admire him when I came to Toronto to study in the late 1950 s . 
Joe had an encyclopaedic knowledge about politics and people . 
he knew each member of my family - my paternal uncles , my maternal grandfather . 
he could place each in various shades of politics or culture or learning from left to right , from observant to secular . 
he was familiar with my father ' s own military record , fighting against Bolsheviks in Europe after World War I , yet he never criticized him or his memory . 
" each man , " he said , " must do what he must do . " 
the very first day after I was appointed to the Senate , I received a call , well after midnight , at the Ch � teau Laurier . 
it was J . B . on the line , whispering to me in Yiddish . 
in hushed tones , he told me that he had decided to write a story about me , my family , and my appointment to the Senate for the Canadian Jewish News . 
i asked him , " J . B . , why so late , why in Yiddish , and why were you whispering ? " 
j . B . ' s response was , " Because ... they are still listening in Ottawa . " 
we continued to whisper our interview in Yiddish for an hour or so in the darkness of that cold , dark January night . 
as I said earlier , J . B . was a true believer . 
he learned the harsh way that radical ideology first separates , then crushes , and eventually eradicates the dreams and the hopes of those very people who promote any harsh or radical ideology . 
when he was about to turn 90 , he was asked to look back on his career . 
about his convictions , he said this : " Despite my age , I ' m still filled with faith in man ' s rise to ever higher and higher levels . 
i am still hurt when I see , or hear people being cruel to one another . " 
then he was asked , if he were to write his epitaph , what it would read . 
he said , " Here lies a man who tried to do the right thing . " 
j . B . did .

honourable senators , I am sure you have all come back refreshed and full of enthusiasm . 
i should like to introduce to you a new Page .

he is replacing Suzanne Vo , who was assigned to us before Christmas and is now working for a senator . 
welcome to the Senate as a page , Robbie .

question PERIOD 
national Defence 
possible Strike by Western Nationals against Iraq - Chain of Command on Disposition of Troops and Mat � riel - Request for Debate 
hon. J . Michael Forrestall : 
honourable senators , as I indicated earlier , the Prime Minister has now advised the nation that Canada has directed to the Gulf the Canadian patrol frigate HMCS Toronto , two C - 130 aircraft and a number of ground personnel . 
honourable senators , would the Leader of the Government in the Senate take the opportunity to enlighten this chamber as to the tasking mission , the role this group will play , and under whose immediate control they will be , so that I will not have to bother him later ? 
would he give us some kind of assurance , as I asked him to do back in November or early December , that an opportunity to discuss this question at length here in the chamber might be provided , so that we may understand and not have to learn from the news media just what actions the Canadian Armed Forces personnel are undertaking ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , it is open to all honourable senators to initiate an inquiry on this or any other subject . 
with respect to obtaining the kind of information that my honourable friend wants prior to learning from the media , I suggest that it would be impossible to hear the news any earlier than when we heard it from the Prime Minister ' s lips last night , when he informed Canadians of his intentions and of the announcements that would be made today following the cabinet meeting , by the Prime Minister , the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of National Defence . 
canada , of course , will be playing a support role , as Senator Forrestall indicated . 
he is quite correct in saying that the HMCS Toronto , which is now in Mediterranean waters , will be sent to the Gulf area , as well as two Hercules aircraft which could be used for transport as well as air refuelling . 
that is in addition to the nine Canadian Forces personnel onboard U.S. AWACS aircraft which are patrolling the no - fly zone over Iraq . 
with respect to under whose control these people , the frigate and the aircraft will be , I will have to ask my colleagues for that information . 
senator Forrestall : 
i asked for this in November of last year . 
there was much opportunity to lay such a motion before this chamber , irrespective of what decisions the other chamber might want to take . 
perhaps they might have benefited from an enlightened debate in this chamber as to conditions under which we should release troops in the first place , what should their role be , who should give them that task and who should command them . 
i ask the leader to reconsider my request of November 19 and lay before this chamber a motion that is debatable so that we might vote on it , should that be necessary . 
i should hope that we would be able to produce a unanimous decision with respect to a debatable motion . 
that could only lend strength to the commitment we have made . 
senator Graham : 
honourable senators , as I indicated earlier , I would be very happy to consider that matter and take it under advisement . 
however , at the same time it is open to the honourable senator , or any other honourable senator , to initiate an appropriate inquiry that would cover all the points that I am sure my honourable friend would want considered . 
solicitor General 
activities of Organized Crime - Money Laundering in New Brunswick - Government Position 
hon. Brenda M. Robertson : 
honourable senators , my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate . 
it concerns an aspect of organized crime which is particularly serious in New Brunswick . 
according to the RCMP , New Brunswick is a top spot in Canada for money laundering . 
apparently , New Brunswick ' s location and its geography make it a prime spot in the money laundering business . 
this report casts a dark shadow over New Brunswick ' s entire economy because organized crime typically invests or hides its ill - gotten proceeds by investing in legitimate businesses . 
if true , this dirty money scheme is undermining other legitimate New Brunswick businesses financed by honest investors and is giving the province a black eye , with a reputation as a somewhat sleazy place to do business . 
my supplementary question to the leader relates to a published report attributed to an RCMP official based in Ottawa that our laws regarding money laundering are relatively weak . 
could the minister advise whether changes in the legislation are contemplated that would allow the enforcement agencies to get tougher with these criminals ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , as usual the honourable senator raises a very important point . 
i know that this sort of thing is a matter of great concern to all the people of New Brunswick , and should be of concern to all the people of Canada . 
with respect to changes in legislation , I am not aware of any at the present time , but it might be appropriate and timely to suggest such changes to further strengthen the law where it is necessary . 
i have been made aware of the problem in New Brunswick , and I certainly will bring my honourable friend ' s representations to the attention of the Solicitor General and determine whether any specific measures are contemplated to fight this problem at the present time . 
i would be interested in receiving any information my honourable friend has in her possession that would further enforce what I would have to say to the Solicitor General . 
senator Robertson : 
i shall send all of the information I have on this issue to the office of my honourable friend . 
the Economy 
strengthening of Economy of New Brunswick - Comments of Solicitor General - Request for Particulars 
hon. Brenda M. Robertson : 
honourable senators , I have another question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate . 
perhaps he could help me understand the meaning of a report that was in the news in New Brunswick sometime over the Christmas break . 
it relates to unspecified plans that the Solicitor General , in his capacity as the regional minister for Atlantic Canada , is working on that will benefit the region . 
too often in the past - and perhaps you might not agree with this - the government down home has said things that increase expectations that something is really in the works , particularly to do with the persistent problems of high unemployment , the wage gap between the Atlantic provinces and the rest of Canada , and the overall slower growth of the region . 
too often it turns out that things are said simply for their public relations value . 
i should really like to know what the minister is talking about . 
to phrase it another way , is the Solicitor General saying that he is working on plans that would help strengthen the region ' s economy , to help people get back to work , and to help provide more dignity to those who simply cannot look after themselves as well as they might ? 
if so , perhaps the honourable leader would provide the Senate with specific details of any such initiatives , including action plans and completion dates ? 
what is the Solicitor General talking about ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , I cannot put words in Minister Scott ' s mouth , but if the honourable senator would provide me with the information that she has in her possession , I will bring it to the attention of my colleague . 
minister Scott has had many discussions . 
i have heard him on many occasions , both with colleagues around the cabinet table and in regional meetings , emphasize the need for special , innovative and creative measures to deal with the chronic unemployment situation in Atlantic Canada . 
being very specific , my honourable friend will know that we cannot have two economies , one west of the Ottawa River and one east of the Ottawa River , as many people are fond of saying . 
senator Robertson : 
honourable senators , as a supplementary , I am sure we have all read the Solicitor General ' s comments on some of these things . 
we keep reading about what he will do , but we never know what precisely it is that he will do . 
i am afraid that , at this stage in the game , we are worn out with surprises down east . 
i am sure the honourable senator would agree with that . 
we would like some honest delivery of new ideas and new development , and perhaps there will be something in Mr. Martin ' s budget . 
i have heard the Solicitor General go on at length , and I should like to know what it is precisely that he is talking about . 
justice 
young Offenders Act - Request for Changes by Province of Saskatchewan - Government Position 
hon. Ethel Cochrane : 
honourable senators , last week the Government of Saskatchewan sent a letter to the Minister of Justice calling for changes to the Young Offenders Act . 
in particular , the Government of Saskatchewan would like the right to publicize the names of violent or chronic young offenders , and the ability to transfer serious , violent or chronic young offenders to adult court . 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , I am not aware that the minister will respond specifically to problems that have been raised by a minister in one specific province . 
justice renewal , of course , is a priority of the government . 
i am sure Senator Cochrane would agree that legislative amendments alone are not enough to address the problems of youth crime . 
we need a multifaceted and cooperative youth justice strategy which includes preventive and early measures as well as legislative amendments . 
at the same time , this strategy must be fully capable of responding effectively to the full range of young offenders , including those who commit serious offences . 
senator Cochrane : 
honourable senators , youth crimes , especially violent crimes and repeated crimes against property , are a concern in many parts of Canada , including my own part of Canada . 
can the Leader of the Government tell us what other provinces or territories have requested changes to this act ? 
can correspondence from these governments on this issue be released to us ? 
senator Graham : 
honourable senators , I will attempt to obtain any such correspondence , and if it is available to be tabled in the chamber , I will be happy to do so . 
there was an extensive review of this issue last year . 
the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights in the other place released a report on what was called renewing youth justice . 
the Minister of Justice will soon be responding to this report with a strategy for the renewal of youth justice . 
i know that there have been movements in some provinces about other measures that might be taken . 
one term is widely bandied about , and that is " restorative justice . " 
at the same time , I know that my honourable friend raises very legitimate concerns , and I would be happy to see if I cannot bring forward an answer that is more particularly germane to the question she raises with respect to specific correspondence from individual provinces . 
national Defence 
possible Strike by Western Nations against Iraq - Assessment of Risk of Humanitarian Disaster from Bombing Strikes on Specific Targets - Government Position 
hon. No � l A . Kinsella ( Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , if the Leader of the Government wishes to turn back the tab to the defence file , then I should like to build on Senator Forrestall ' s questions . 
honourable senators , if the Government of Canada is now committed to supporting the American - planned intervention in Iraq should diplomatic efforts fail , I am somewhat concerned about the proposal for air strikes against strategic sites in Iraq , where biological and chemical weapons may be stored . 
i assume that there has been some risk assessment concerning that issue . 
has the Government of Canada conducted a risk assessment , or do you have assurances from the Americans on that topic ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , I am not aware of any particular risk assessment that has been made by Canada . 
however , I believe that those responsible have come to the conclusion that there is a greater risk from the weapons of mass destruction that are obviously being hidden by Saddam Hussein . 
that greater risk exists and the time has long passed for discussion - whether it is the United States , Canada , Britain and our allies or others who are concerned with the future of mankind . 
some kind of decisive action must be taken . 
as to which risk would be greater , to allow the present situation to prolong itself or to allow Saddam Hussein to build up more stores of weapons of mass destruction , President Clinton , Prime Minister Chr � tien and other world leaders have determined that action now is an absolute necessity . 
senator Kinsella : 
honourable senators , does the Leader of the Government not agree that the dropping of explosive devices - either smart bombs or stupid bombs - from 24,000 feet , or whatever altitude , involves a major margin of error in the sense that after bombing a site , these chemicals and biological materials will be totally out of control . 
if the Government of Canada is committing itself to a support role , yet to be fully defined in terms of the assets that will be designed and the effectiveness of those assets , the objective of the military intervention , if it comes to that , will involve bombing . 
we are told that it will not be a ground force intervention . 
what happens to the biological and chemical weapons which are in storage in silos , or wherever they store them ? 
what assurances do we have that they will not be released in a totally uncontrolled fashion , which could cause a humanitarian disaster the likes of which this world has yet to see . 
senator Graham : 
honourable senators , I understand perfectly well . 
that is a concern of the entire world . 
it is a question of whether you act now or delay again while Saddam Hussein continues to build up his arsenal of mass destruction . 
there are no winners in a situation of this kind . 
we still hope that a diplomatic solution will be found . 
however , we cannot prolong a decision . 
i support the decision that Canada play a supporting role if , indeed , a diplomatic solution is not found and further action must be taken . 
senator Kinsella : 
honourable senators , has Canada consulted with our friends in countries such as Jordan , Saudi Arabia , Israel , Syria or Lebanon ? 
these countries are immediately adjacent to those sites , should a bombing exercise release that biological material into the environment . 
they are the people who will be immediately affected . 
has Canada been in diplomatic contact with those countries ? 
senator Graham : 
the answer is a very definitive , " Yes ; on a continuing basis . " 
national Finance 
proposed Merger of Royal Bank and Bank of Montreal - Government Position 
hon. Norman K . Atkins : 
honourable senators , my question is to the Leader of the Government . 
a merger is being proposed between two of Canada ' s banks , namely , the Bank of Montreal and the Royal Bank of Canada . 
there was also a task force established by the federal government some time ago to study the future of financial institutions in Canada , including recommendations for possible changes to the Bank Act . 
is it the intention of the government to deal with this proposed merger prior to the final report of its financial task force being made public ? 
if so , what criteria will be applied to its decision - making process ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , the Minister of Finance has made it clear that no action will be taken until the task force report has been submitted . 
senator Atkins : 
will the task force be making an interim report before the summer break , and will it set out criteria for possible approval ? 
when can we expect to see such an interim report or government action on this matter ? 
senator Graham : 
honourable senators , I am not aware of any interim report that is planned at the present time . 
i would be happy to determine if an interim report is contemplated , and I will bring that information to my honourable friend . 
senator Atkins : 
honourable senators , does the government not consider that the announcement of the banks regarding this merger is more important than putting it off until next fall ? 
senator Graham : 
honourable senators , the process was set in motion when the task force was established . 
the government still believes that that is the correct route . 
science , Research and Development 
cuts to Funding of Medical Research - Government Position 
hon. Terry Stratton : 
honourable senators , I have a question for the Leader of the Government , and it refers to the 1993 Liberal Red Book promise to provide stable funding for research granting councils . 
the Medical Research Council helps to fund vital medical research in Canadian universities . 
in spite of that promise of stable funding in 1993 , the budget of the Medical Research Council has been cut by $ 20 million . 
according to last year ' s estimates , a further $ 40 million will be cut by 1999 . The Globe and Mail reported on February 4 , 1998 , that the government now plans to at least cancel plans for their cuts as part of the learning initiative . 
assuming that this report is true , is the government prepared to commit that any new funding announced in this coming budget will represent stable funding and that medical research will not be cut again ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , as I indicated , the budget will be brought down on February 24 . 
the government assigns very high priority to addressing the issue of funding for the Medical Research Council and other granting councils . 
we can look forward to the budget on February 24 and determine at that time what will be done with respect to future funding . 
senator Stratton : 
honourable senators , I am delighted that the Leader of the Government in the Senate has met with the President of the Medical Research Council . 
honourable senators , I had to see a doctor in December for a quick checkup which took three minutes . 
the doctor then spent 15 minutes pleading with me to make a case , federally and provincially . 
senior researchers are pleading for more money . 
they receive their grants 50 per cent of the time , but they are still desperately short . 
the young researchers do not have a hope , because the seniors are receiving all the grants . 
can the honourable senator give us any assurance that he will try , to the greatest extent possible , to ensure that funding is stabilized , if not increased ? 
senator Graham : 
senator Stratton spent 15 minutes with his doctor hearing about pressures with respect to the need for increased funding for medical research . 
i spent an hour and a half with Dr. Dickson and Dr. Friesen and I did not get the benefit of a checkup . 
however , I listened very carefully and I wish to assure my honourable friends that their representations were brought to the attention of my colleagues . 
the situation to which Senator Stratton alludes has led to strong representations and pressures on the government to restore or increase Medical Research Council funding . 
if I recall correctly , the House of Commons Finance Committee has recommended for the last three years that funding for the MRC and other councils be increased . 
if I recall correctly - and I may regret saying what I am about to say - the Minister of Finance indicated in October of 1997 that MRC funding would not only be restored but would be increased . 
the government ' s position will be made known in the 1998 budget . 
senator Stratton : 
may I remind the honourable leader of his words if that does not happen ? 
senator Graham : 
i know you will . 
revenue Canada 
possible Postponement of Income Tax Deadline Dates for Victims of Ice Storm - Government Position 
hon. Marjory LeBreton : 
honourable senators , my question relates to the recent ice storm in Eastern Ontario and Quebec , and it is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate . 
the decision of the government to extend the RRSP deadline this year by one month is welcome news to those living in the area ravaged by January ' s ice storm , as was the decision made following the postal strike to extend by one month the deadline for charitable donations . 
however , there is another group of taxpayers who is also greatly in need of help . 
many small businesses and self - employed workers in areas hit by the ice storm are having a hard time paying their bills and meeting financial commitments . 
many have missed up to a month ' s income and many have suffered significant losses due to either the damage caused by the ice storm or the lack of electricity . 
march 15 looms as the deadline for these Canadians to make the first of their quarterly tax instalments to Revenue Canada , a deadline that many will have a hard time meeting . 
could the minister advise the Senate of whether any consideration will be given to extending the quarterly income tax payment deadline for those in the affected areas ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , I am not aware of any present proposal along those lines , but I should be very happy to make such representations on behalf of small businesses . 
i am sure that the officials responsible are quite cognizant of the need . 
while I am on my feet , I wish to pay special tribute to all the people in Quebec , Ontario , New Brunswick and other parts of Canada , and indeed our friends from south of the border , who came to assist in a remarkable demonstration of togetherness , helpfulness and community among Canadians . 
you had only to be in the Corel Centre on Sunday afternoon to see an indication of that spirit of community and that it is alive and well in Ottawa and the surrounding communities . 
hon. Senators : 
hear , hear !

investigation Into Sale of Airbus Aircraft to Air Canada - Status of Letter to Swiss Authorities - Government Position 
( response to question raised by Hon. Marjory Lebreton on October 30 , 1997 ) 
the Department of Justice took appropriate action to ensure that there was no misunderstanding concerning the Letter of Request which was sent to the Swiss authorities in late September , 1995 . 
on November 14 , 1995 , a second letter was forwarded to the Swiss authorities re - emphasizing that the Letter of Request contained allegations only , and that it was sent in the context of a police investigation . 
in January , 1997 , subsequent to the out - of - court settlement with Mr. Mulroney , a third letter was sent to the Swiss authorities , informing them that the Government of Canada apologized for some of the language in the Letter of Request and clarifying once more that the letter contained allegations pursuant to a police investigation . 
it is noteworthy that in the Settlement Agreement , 
Mr. Mulroney specifically acknowledged that the RCMP and the Department of Justice , in sending the Request for Assistance to Switzerland , had acted within their legitimate responsibilities in this matter ; and , 
Mr. Mulroney also acknowledged that the RCMP must continue to investigate any allegations of illegality or wrongdoing which are brought to its attention . 
( response to question raised by Hon. John Lynch - Staunton on October 30 , 1997 ) 
the Letter of Request has not been withdrawn because there is an ongoing police investigation , and the Letter is part of that investigation . 
on November 27 , 1997 , RCMP Commissioner Murray stated that the Airbus investigation is " ongoing and active . " 
( response to question raised by Hon. John Lynch - Staunton on November 5 , 1997 ) 
regarding the request to remove Mr. Mulroney ' s name from the letter , the Department of Justice took appropriate action to ensure that there was no misunderstanding concerning the Letter of Request which was sent to the Swiss authorities in late September , 1995 . 
on November 14 , 1995 , a second letter was forwarded to the Swiss authorities re - emphasizing that the Letter of Request contained allegations only , and that it was sent in the context of a police investigation .

private Wood - Lots in Maritime Provinces - Task Force Recommendations - Government Position 
( response to question raised by Hon. Brenda M. Robertson on November 19 , 1997 ) 
in September 1997 , the National Round Table on the Environment and Economy ( NRTEE ) released a report entitled , State of the Debate on the Environment and the Economy : 
private Woodlot Management in the Maritimes . 
after the release of this report , the NRTEE sponsored a workshop in October in Ottawa to discuss specific economic instruments to encourage sustainability on private lands . 
this included a roundtable session on encouraging sustainability for private wood - lots . 
the purpose of the workshop was to develop specific proposals on tax and other measures which could be included in the NRTEE ' s pre - Budget 1998 submission to the Minister of Finance . 
the Department of Finance participated in the NRTEE workshop and has now received the NRTEE ' s specific recommendations relating to private wood - lots . 
the Minister of Finance will consider the NRTEE ' s recommendations in preparing the Federal Government ' s 1998 Budget .

investigation into Sale of Airbus Aircraft to Air Canada - Officials Responsible for Wording in Letter to Swiss Authorities - Government Position 
( response to question raised by Hon. Marjory LeBreton on November 20 , 1997 ) 
the International Assistance Group receives and reviews all Letters of Request presented by investigating police agencies . It 
is a matter of public record that the Senior Counsel of the International Assistance Group reviewed and signed the Letter of Request which went to the Swiss authorities . 
no one in the Department of Justice outside the International Assistance Group worked on the Letter of Request . 
a general description of the process followed in the drafting of the Letter of Request is found in the Statement of Assumed Facts which was filed in the Mulroney court proceedings . 
the Environment 
identification and Documentation of Federal Contaminated Sites - Government Position 
( response to question raised by Hon. Fernand Roberge on December 2 , 1997 ) 
under the current government accountability framework , departments are responsible for managing the contaminated properties under their custody . 
this includes the identification and listing of contaminated properties , as well as the assessment and ultimate remediation of these sites . 
timetables , along with action plans for dealing with contaminated sites should be provided by departments in their sustainable development strategies which were tabled in the House on December 10 , 1997 . 
the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development may then monitor the progress achieved across the federal government . 
the Treasury Board Secretariat is responsible for maintaining information on federal real property holdings as well as developing central policies dealing with the general management of the federal land portfolio and the reporting of liabilities in the Public Accounts . 
for its part , Environment Canada has contributed , and continues to develop , scientific and technical guidance useful for federal stakeholders in managing their environmental issues . 
in the Auditor General ' s follow - up evaluation , preparedness was addressed for marine oil and chemicals as well as non - marine chemicals . 
environment Canada was primarily involved with the follow - up on non - marine chemicals . 
a number of initiatives have been undertaken in the last five years to ensure a higher level of emergency preparedness in Canada . 
MIACC is a national voluntary multi - stakeholder forum comprising several federal departments , the provinces , industry and first responder organizations . 
since 1995 , over 1500 sites and approximately 500 such communities have been identified . 
environment Canada co - chairs the Federal Committee on Environmental Emergencies . 
this body coordinates the activities of affected federal departments in the event of a major environmental emergency . 
finally , the government has indicated that it is committed to reintroducing the CEPA legislation early in its mandate . 
the Bill contains provisions for environmental matters related to emergencies . 
environment Canada is currently considering input from stakeholders on the various provision including emergencies , before re - introduction of the Bill . 
environment Canada will produce a report to Parliament in early 1998 on the destruction of federal PCB wastes . 
over 95 % of the federal PCB wastes that were in storage in 1995 were destroyed under a national contract between Public Works and Government Services Canada and BOVAR Waste Management Inc. 
immigration 
estimate of Overall Costs of Processing Refugees - Timetable for Presentation to Parliament - Government Position 
( response to question raised by Hon. Donald H . Oliver on December 3 , 1997 ) 
the Immigration and Refugee Board identifies in its 1997 - 98 Main Estimates an amount of $ 39.46 M. with respect to Refugee Determination . 
however , the Department has previously indicated it will undertake a review of the in - Canada refugee processing costs . 
it was decided that the study would commence following the completion of the recent Departmental re - engineering exercise in order to capture costs associated with new ways of operation . 
the study has recently commenced and it is planned that results will be available in the 1998 - 99 fiscal year . 
monitoring of Progress of Refugee Claims - Government Policy 
a ) The Department does monitor the progress of individual refugee claims . 
information concerning the status of a refugee claim is exchanged between the Department and the Immigration and Refugee Board . 
however , the Department does not have the capability to produce collective statistics on some aspects of the process . 
b ) With respect to determining the eligibility of a refugee claimant upon entry to Canada , all refugee claimants are photographed and fingerprinted at the time the initial claim is made . 
photos and prints are then sent to the RCMP to be checked against the criminal history data bank . 
this check determines whether the claimant has a criminal record in Canada or whether a previous refugee claim has been made . 
the majority of persons who claim refugee status are undocumented . 
immigration officers must rely on information provided by the claimant in a sworn declaration and their fingerprints . 
in 1997 , immigration officials asked the RCMP to complete additional checks against foreign data banks on claimants where background information gave reason to conduct further investigation . 
over 1,900 such checks were made . 
obtaining background information on refugee claimants is a major challenge . 
however , even where a claimant has committed a serious offense , they are eligible to be heard by the Convention Refugee Determination Division ( CRDD ) unless the Minister has issued an opinion that they are a danger to the public . 
likewise a claimant described for a security violation is eligible to have a claim heard unless the Minister issues an opinion that it would be contrary to the public interest . 
the passage of Bill C - 44 in 1995 enacted legislative changes which enhanced the power of the Minister to deal with the misuse of the refugee protection system by serious criminals and by persons making fraudulent or multiple claims . 
for example , Bill C - 44 allows a senior immigration officer to re - visit positive eligibility decisions in claims pending before the Immigration and Refugee Board ( IRB ) where there is a conviction for a serious crime . 
it also allows a senior immigration officer to determine , in cases where a person has made multiple claims to be a refugee which of the claims is the official claim and to nullify all other claims . 
it must be remembered , however , that a very small number of claimants are found to be ineligible after the results of these checks are completed . 
in 1996 , only 31 cases out of more than 25,000 had to be reconsidered after the results of these checks were received . 
given these numbers , it is sound management to refer claims to the Convention Refugee Determination Division ( CRDD ) while we await the results of these checks so as not to delay all cases for the small proportion that will be found ineligible . 
the criteria to access the refugee determination process were designed to ensure that Canada ' s protection would be extended to all those with a genuine claim to persecution . 
the Department is exploring ways to expand and enhance our ability to conduct background investigations , without jeopardizing the safety of claimants and their families . 
as the Auditor - General himself noted , the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration established an Immigration Legislative Review Advisory Group tasked with formulating recommendations to improve immigration legislation . 
this review includes a thorough examination of the current refugee determination process . 
recommendations on ways to protect the integrity and efficiency of the system were made in the Advisory Group Report . 
in the coming months , the Minister will be holding public hearings and consulting on the report ' s recommendations in order to give as many interested parties and stakeholders as possible the opportunity to be heard . 
solicitor General 
community Services for Offenders - Eligibility of Non - violent Criminals - Request for Clarification 
( response to question raised by Hon. Brenda M. Robertson on December 8 , 1997 ) 
in the September , 1997 , Speech from the Throne , the Government pledged to develop alternatives to incarceration for low - risk , non - violent offenders , through sentencing reforms , community diversion programs and alternative sanctions . 
for some offenders and some offences incarceration is the only appropriate sanction . 
for a smaller number of offenders a very long period of incarceration may be our only viable alternative . 
society has the right to be protected , Canadians have the right to be safe . 
but we need to be clear about whom we want and need most to be protected from and how we can most efficiently ensure that protection . 
we should avoid what we are seeing in some other countries where prison has become the response of first choice to crime of almost all types . 
in May , 1996 , Federal / Provincial and Territorial Ministers Responsible for Justice reviewed the " Corrections Population Growth " paper and endorsed a number of recommendations , including a set of principles to guide future direction . 
one of the principles contained in the paper states : 
determining when an alternative to incarceration may be appropriate requires a thorough evaluation of each potential case . 
some of the factors that should be taken into consideration include : 
the criminal history of the offender ; 
the nature of the current offence ; 
the social history of the offender ; 
the substance abuse history 
the availability of suitable programs in the community , and numerous other factors . 
public safety remains the Government ' s number one priority , but our criminal justice system must be organized to be more effective and efficient in order to contribute to the long - term protection of the public . 
canada - United States Relations 
implementation of Law Requiring Visas for Canadians to Enter United States - Possibility of Exemption - Government Position 
( response to question raised by Hon. Senator Norman K . Atkins on December 8 , 1997 ) 
from the outset , Canada ' s Embassy in Washington has been vigilant in its efforts to protect Canada ' s interests . 
although the new immigration legislation was introduced in 1995 , Section 110 was not part of the original House and Senate bills . 
in fact , Section 110 did not publicly appear in the legislation until the Conference Report was released for printing on September 24 , 1996 - three business days before the Act was signed by President Clinton . 
the Embassy and the U.S. Administration ( Justice Department / Immigration & Naturalization Service ) discovered Section 110 in mid - October after an exhaustive review of the 251 page Conference Report . 
the Embassy consulted the Administration ( INS ) who confirmed that the unfortunate use of the word alien could affect Canadians and the northern border . 
the Embassy immediately contacted the Chief Counsels of both the House and Senate Immigration Subcommittees to clarify the meaning of the legislation . 
they both confirmed that the intent was to develop an overstays monitoring system for nationals of countries who enjoy a visa exemption under the 1986 Visa Waiver Programme and nationals of countries who require a visa . 
they also confirmed that the measure was never intended to target Canadians who , incidentally , were visa - exempt well before the introduction of the 1986 Visa Waiver Programme . 
the Chief Counsels proposed the exchange of letters between the Ambassador and the two Chairs as a means of clarifying legislative intent and allowing the Administration to exempt Canadians from Section 110 ' s implementation . 
at that stage , the Administration indicated that an exchange of letters clarifying the legislative intent could be sufficient to exempt Canada from the measure . 
the Embassy and Congressional staff worked closely , through numerous drafts and consultations , to develop what became the exchange of correspondence between the Ambassador and the two Immigration Subcommittee Chairs in December 1996 . 
unfortunately , INS changed its view and considered further Congressional direction was required . 
as a result , the Government of Canada , in cooperation with Congressional allies , launched a public advocacy campaign to restore the status quo ante . 
as part of the advocacy strategy , the Embassy and consulates have been speaking to key government officials , U.S. business interests , and to over two dozen newspapers , journals and magazines from all regions in the U.S. , including the New York Times , the Detroit Free Press , the Seattle Times and the Miami Herald . 
at the same time , the Prime Minister , Ministers Axworthy , Marchi , Robillard , Collenette and Dhaliwal , and Parliamentarians have raised this issue with their U.S. counterparts . 
as a result of Canada ' s advocacy initiative , the U.S. administration has publicly stated its concern that implementation of Section 110 would be very problematic and detrimental to efforts made to simplify cross - border travel . 
it is , therefore , clear that the Embassy took immediate action to address the Section 110 and has continued to defend Canadian interests . 
as a result of their activism , Michigan Senator Spencer Abraham took up the fight against the border measure and introduced a bill to repeal the effects of Section 110 . 
on a parallel track , Representative Solomon has also introduced an amendment that delays Section 110 ' s implementation for one year . 
canada is concerned that Solomon ' s bill would maintain Section 110 and prolong the uncertainty surrounding its potential implementation . 
the two different approaches reflected in the bills will be addressed when Congress reconvenes in January 1998 . 
we are encouraged by the support being generated for Canada ' s position and will continue to put pressure on the U.S. Congress and Administration in a concerted manner to advance the legislative approach adopted by Senator Abraham .

search and Rescue Helicopter Replacement Program - Possible Cabinet Discussion on Awarding Contract for Helicopter Purchase - Government Position 
as of December 16 , 1997 , 29 of 30 Sea King helicopters have been inspected . 
one has yet to be inspected as it is at sea ; it is expected to return to port on December 18 , 1997 at which time it will be inspected . 
27 of 29 inspected helicopters have been deemed serviceable . 
2 . At the time the special inspection of the Sea King fleet was ordered , three aircraft were deployed at sea . 
there was no impact on training with our allies , and Canada received no criticism from them regarding this special inspection . 
federal Provincial Relations 
( response to question raised by Hon. Fernand Roberge on December 9 , 1997 ) 
Quebec will receive $ 6.8 billion ( cash and tax transfer ) this year under the Canada Health and Social Transfer ( CHST ) . 
this will increase by almost $ 400 million to $ 7.2 billion in 2002 - 03 . 
figures that suggest that transfers to Quebec will decline ignore the tax point transfer which is an integral part of the CHST . 
it is necessary to include both the tax point transfer as well as the cash transfer component when calculating the total - tax points increase in value over time and thus represent a growing source of revenue for provinces . 
in 1997 - 98 , Quebec will receive almost $ 3 billion under the CHST tax point transfer . 
there are no separate cash floors for each province and territory . 
the $ 12.5 billion cash floor applies to the country as a whole - all provinces benefit from the protection offered by the floor .

efficacy of Tracking System on Unsuccessful Refugee Claimants - Government Position 
( response to questions raised by Hon. Donald H . Oliver on December 8 , 1997 ) 
at the outset , it is important to state that Canada does not have exit controls at the border . 
it is important to note that removals are a high priority for the Department of Citizenship and Immigration , with the greatest focus being given to the removal of foreign criminals and failed refugee claimants . 
there has been a 38 % increase in removals to the end of September of this year , compared to the same period last year . 
of the total outstanding removal orders , the vast majority are failed refugee claimants and those who have overstayed their visitor status . 
the majority are NOT criminals . 
CIC is committed to reducing impediments to removals and over the past two years has introduced a number of measures which demonstrate this commitment . 
for example , bi - lateral removal agreements have been signed with a number of countries to facilitate removals and negotiations are continuing for new agreements with others . 
the Immigration Regulations have been changed to streamline certain review processes ( PDRCC ) . 
CIC has increased dialogue with provincial and municipal authorities to obtain agreements for sharing information on persons to be removed , and is examining ways to encourage voluntary compliance with removal orders . 
a ) Bonds are only requested for refugee claimants where there is reason to believe the person is unlikely to appear as directed . 
the Immigration Act provides the authority to require cash bonds , performance bonds or a combination of both where necessary to ensure a person ' s compliance with terms and conditions of admission or release from detention . 
our current system does not break down the number of bonds taken for refugee claimants versus other enforcement cases . 
b ) Bonds are not posted by groups or corporations on behalf of individuals so there is no record of church groups posting bonds for refugee claimants in Canada . 
church groups may sign an undertaking to support a refugee ( s ) who has been selected abroad for the initial period of settlement in Canada . 
however , this agreement is to ensure that the refugee ( s ) will receive the support they require to integrate into Canadian society . 
federal - Provincial Relations 
reduction in Transfer Payments to Provinces - Effect on Atlantic Provinces 
( response to question raised by Hon. Mabel M. DeWare on December 9 , 1997 ) 
the less well - off provinces receive far more transfers from the federal government than the better - off provinces precisely so that they can provide their residents with the same kind of services as other provinces - including health , education , and social assistance . 
this redistribution is accomplished primarily through the Equalization program which provides over $ 8 billion a year only to the less well - off provinces . 
Ontario , Alberta and B.C. receive no Equalization . 
the Canada Health and Social Transfer ( CHST ) is intended to help all provinces with the costs of health , post - secondary education and social assistance . 
thanks to the fiscal progress the federal government has made , the CHST will increase in Atlantic Canada , Saskatchewan and Manitoba , next year , the year after and , in fact , every year as far as projections are available out to 2002 - 03 . 
over the next five years , the CHST will grow by 2.5 % per year , on average , from $ 25 billion this year to over $ 28 billion in 2002 - 03 . 
the CHST is made up of a cash component and a tax point transfer . 
tax point transfers must be included when calculating the total amount . 
they increase in value over time and thus represent a growing source of revenue for provinces . 
immigration 
tracking and Detention of Unsuccessful Refugee Claimants - Government Position 
( response to questions raised by Hon. Donald H . Oliver on December 9 , 1997 ) 
it is misleading to assume that 78 per cent of failed refugee claimants cannot be found anywhere in Canada or have either not been or cannot be removed . 
some failed refugee claimants who are subject to effective removal orders cannot be removed due to the existence of a statutory prohibition against their removal from Canada or a Court order prohibiting Citizenship and Immigration Canada from executing the removal order . 
in other words , removal cannot legally occur until the statutory prohibitions or court orders expire . 
statutory prohibitions against removal are set out in the Immigration Act . 
these include prohibitions against the removal of failed refugee claimants who are pursuing an application to the Federal Court for judicial review of the negative refugee determination , and against removal of failed claimants who have pending applications for membership in the Post - Determination Refugee Claimants in Canada ( PDRCC ) class . 
in addition , given that Canada does not have exit controls , there may a good number of failed claimants who have already left the country but who have not confirmed their departure . 
existing provisions in the Immigration Act provide that a person may be detained for the following reasons : 
there are reasonable grounds to believe the person poses a danger to the public ; 
there are reasonable grounds to believe the person would not appear for the examination , inquiry or proceeding in relation to the decision or for removal from Canada ; 
a person is unable to satisfy an immigration officer with respect to that person ' s identity ; or 
the department is also revising its detention guidelines to encourage a more strategic use of resources while maintaining the safety and security of the public . 
it is important to note that Citizenship and Immigration Canada does not normally detain refugee claimants or persons determined to be convention refugees unless the person is a danger to the public . 
in some cases , failed refugee claimants who have exhausted all recourse are detained prior to removal from Canada . 
CIC has three detention centers located in Mississauga , Laval and Vancouver . 
immigration detention centers are minimum security facilities that provide for the detention of persons who have demonstrated a low security risk and who have a non - violent background . 
persons considered high security risks and those who have demonstrated violent backgrounds would normally be detained at a provincially run institution . 
detention Facilities for Refugee Claimants - Request for Particulars 
the number of detainees fluctuates ( frequently for example , non - claimants are detained for 48 hrs and then removed ) and CIC does not differentiate between detainees who are refugee claimants and non - claimants when keeping track of the overall numbers . 
these three regions account for approximately 94 % of total detention . 
in all other areas , we detain at facilities owned and operated by provincial governments . 
for their services , we are charged a per diem rate , which varies between provinces . 
provincial detention centers are also used in areas where we lease facilities for cases requiring a higher level of security than we are able to provide in our immigration holding centers . 
in fiscal year 1996 - 97 , the department of Citizenship and Immigration detained 6,401 persons for a total of 138,481 detention days and at a cost of $ 20,490,132 . 
fisheries and Oceans 
negotiations on Multilateral Agreement on Investment - Continuation of Limit on Foreign Ownership of Commercial Licences - Government Position 
( response to question raised by Hon. G � rald J . Comeau on December 9 , 1997 ) 
canada has tabled a draft reservation to the Multilateral Agreement on Investment ( MAI ) that will allow the government to maintain a 49 percent foreign - ownership limit on companies that hold commercial fishing licenses in Canada . 
this reservation preserves the discretionary authority of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to issue commercial fishing licenses pursuant to the Fisheries Act and the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act . 
foreign fishing vessels are prohibited from fishing in Canada ' s 200 - mile Exclusive Economic Zone unless they are authorised to do so under a license issued by the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans . 
canada has tabled another reservation preserving the authority of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans to grant port privileges only to fishing vessels from countries with which Canada maintains favourable fishing relations , based primarily on adherence by those countries to Canadian and international conservation practises and policies . 
these reservations are the same as those Canada secured under the NAFTA . 
since the outset of the negotiations , Canadian officials have been consulting extensively with the provinces , the private sector and other organisations . 
specific industry sectors have been consulted primarily through the sectoral advisory groups on international trade ( SAGIT ) . 
the Minister for International Trade has written to the chairs of all SAGITs , including the Fish and Seafood Products SAGIT , seeking their views on Canada ' s approach in the MAI negotiations . 
canada ' s position in the MAI negotiations respecting the fishing industry is best seen in light of Canada ' s overall negotiating objective which is to secure the same rights and obligations that Canada exchanged with the United States and Mexico under the NAFTA . 
federal - Provincial Relations 
reduction in Transfer Payments to Atlantic Provinces Equal to Increase in Social Transfers - Government Position 
( response to question raised by Hon. Brenda M. Robertson on December 9 , 1997 ) 
the Canada Health and Social Transfer ( CHST ) will increase in Atlantic Canada next year and the year after and every year in fact as far as projections are available , out to 2002 - 03 . 
fiscal progress means the federal government can now re - invest in priority spending such as health and education . 
the increase in the CHST cash floor from $ 11 billion to $ 12.5 billion is the largest single reinvestment made by the federal government . 
it represents close to $ 7 billion more over 6 years for provincial governments - all provinces will get more money . The 
CHST will grow by 2.5 % per year , on average , over the next five years - from $ 25 billion this year to $ 28 billion in 2002 - 03 ( cash and tax transfer ) . 
plus , the higher cash floor is being put in place one year earlier than previously announced - it begins in 1997 - 98 and gives the provinces an extra $ 143 million this year .

united Nations Committees - Possible Change in Government Policies - Government Position 
( response to questions raised by Hon. No � l A . Kinsella and Hon. A . Raynell Andreychuk on December 10 , 1997 ) 
canada is party to the six principal United Nations human rights treaties and submits regular reports to the UN committees responsible for overseeing their implementation . 
every five years , Canada reports on progress made in realizing the rights contained in the Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights . 
input was also requested from interested Canadian non - governmental organizations during preparation of the document . 
in the normal course of events , we would have expected to present this report in 1999 or 2000 because of the lengthy backlog of reports for consideration by the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights . 
however , the Committee , in response to a request from Canadian non - governmental organizations who object to the introduction of the Canada Health and Social Transfer , agreed to early consideration of Canada ' s report . 
after a careful review of the situation , Canada concluded that there are no special circumstances which require early consideration of Canada ' s report by the Committee . 
early consideration is only justified when there are sudden changes or exceptional circumstances in a country ' s situation which require immediate attention . 
last year the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) human development report again rated Canada the best country in the world in which to live . 
this is not the sign of a social situation which demands immediate attention . 
although Canada does not agree with this Committee ' s procedural decision , the government has continued to seek ways to cooperate and find an acceptable solution . 
canada strongly supports the work of the UN treaty committees . 
further discussions have led to a satisfactory compromise regarding when Canada will appear before the committee , now scheduled for the session 16 November to 4 December 1998 . 
in response to the request by Senator Kinsella , here follows correspondence from Andrew McAlister , Charge d ' affaires of the Permanent Mission of Canada to the United Nations in Geneva to Philip Alston , Chairperson of the Committee for Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , on this topic . 
it would be inappropriate for the government to provide letters originating from another organization . 
canada has always taken its obligations under human rights treaties very seriously and will continue to do so . Submitting reports is an important part of that process , and Canada has fulfilled that obligation .

dear Mr. Alston , 
i am writing further to your letter of May 27 , 1997 , regarding Canada ' s third periodic report to the Committee on Economic , Social , and Cultural Rights . 
in your letter you indicated that the Committee intends to consider Canada ' s third periodic report at its eighteenth session , in the spring of 1998 . However , it has been brought to my attention that under the normal , established procedures this report would be considered no earlier than 1999 . 
after a careful review of the situation , Canada has concluded that there are no special circumstances which might necessitate early consideration of Canada ' s report by the Committee . 
given this , and taking into account our other reporting obligations at this time , I must inform you that Canada is not prepared to appear before the Committee at its eighteenth session . 
naturally , we will be happy to present our report at a time consistent with the regular , established procedures of the Committee . 
yours sincerely ,

APEC Summit - Domination by Trade and Economic Issues - Government Position 
( response to question raised by Hon. Donald H . Oliver on December 10 , 1997 ) 
chief Gail Sparrow had an unprecedented opportunity to personally greet every Leader entering the Museum . 
she was the only person other than the Prime Minister to do so . 
agreement had been reached that the length of Chief Sparrow ' s remarks was to be 4 to 6 minutes . 
when the ceremony was rehearsed the day before , Chief Sparrow ' s remarks took 12 minutes . 
it was on this basis that the remarks were removed from the programme . 
the prayer was also removed from the programme , due to last - minute time constraints . 
these decisions are unrelated to the content of Chief Sparrow ' s remarks . 
in fact , the Leaders ' Declaration contains language that reflects the links between economic development and the well - being of people and the responsibility of Leaders to be accountable to their population .

agreement on International Humane Trapping Standards - Provision for Industrial Adjustment Program - Government Position 
( response to question raised by Hon. Mira Spivak on December 12 , 1997 ) 
the Agreement on International Trapping Standards , which has been signed by Canada and the European Union and will soon be signed by the Russian Federation , commits the parties to make certain changes to their wildlife regulations and to carry out trap research / testing of commonly used traps against the new humane standards . 
canada has agreed to immediately ban " conventional steel - jawed leghold restraining traps " for seven fur - bearing species and for another five species over the next three years from the date of final ratification of the Agreement . 
the parties also are obligated to test the most commonly used traps for the listed species ( 19 in total ) over the next five years , and to then phase out those traps which fail to meet the new humane standards . 
the Department of Human Resources and Development , the department responsible for industrial adjustment programs , is negotiating with the Fur Institute of Canada to enter into the development of Occupational Standards for trappers ( either Aboriginal or non - Aboriginal ) in adjusting to the regulatory / technical ( traps ) changes which might come about as a result of the Agreement . 
a research phase could be looked at in order to bring all the partners to the table and to look at all the profiles already developed . 
this will also determine whether such a program will be needed and the time framing for the development . 
DIAND has committed funding to support consultations between national / regional Aboriginal groups , and between them and the provincial / territorial governments on what the Agreement entails , what governments are obligated to do , and then as the research results start to emerge , what changes are likely to be required ( if any ) in both trapping regulations and practices .

Manitoba - SOWIND Air Crash at Little Grand Rapids - Response of Rescue Team - Availability of Necessary Equipment - Request for Departmental Statement 
( response to questions raised by Hon. Terry Stratton and Hon. Janis Johnson on December 12 , 1997 ) 
the search and rescue ( SAR ) response during SAR SOWIND was organized by controllers at the Rescue Coordination Centre ( RCC ) in Trenton , Ontario . 
additionally , because this accident had the potential to be a major air disaster ( ie . an incident involving a large number of victims ) , an emergency operations centre was established at 1 Canadian Air Division Headquarters in Winnipeg in the event that a larger military response was needed . 
the SOWIND accident took place at an airfield where there was an immediate and effective community response . 
by the time the Hercules aircraft arrived from Winnipeg with nine SAR para - rescue personnel and a medical team on board , the situation had been stabilized . 
the two Griffon helicopters from Cold Lake also encountered severe weather that delayed their arrival . 
a decision was made that the Labrador helicopter from Trenton would not be launched because it had to travel nearly 500 miles further ( about 5 - 6 hours longer ) than the Griffon helicopters as well as attempt to fly through worse weather . 
it is important to note that a response to a SAR incident does not always require the use of Canadian Forces aircraft . 
in fact , of the over 7,000 SAR cases coordinated each year by Canada ' s three Rescue Coordination Centres , Canadian Forces aircraft only participate in roughly 20 % . 
in other incidents , the RCCs will use other federal resources ( primarily Canadian Coast Guard ) , volunteer groups , or contracted services . 
a civilian helicopter was not hired for SAR SOWIND because the crew of the Hercules advised that the weather conditions at Little Grand Rapids were so severe that a helicopter would have extreme difficulty flying into the site . 
the RCC controllers , therefore , determined that they could be putting a civilian helicopter crew at undue risk if they chartered one . 
the final result of SAR SOWIND must also be assessed . 
no lives were lost because Canadian Forces aircraft did not arrive at the crash site earlier . 
a civilian helicopter penetrated the poor weather to land at Little Grand Rapids nineteen hours after the crash ( 90 minutes before the Hercules landed ) and air - evacuated two ambulatory survivors . 
the Hercules evacuated the remaining nine survivors plus one more patient , an urgent dialysis case . 
2 . The basing of Canadian Forces primary SAR aircraft is tied to historical SAR incident locations and their severity . Less 
then 10 % of SAR cases , which include marine and humanitarian assistance incidents as well as air incidents , take place in the Prairie Region . 
in fact , nearly 80 % of SAR cases are marine - related . 
thus most SAR aircraft are located near the coasts or near the Great Lakes . 
there has always been a SAR squadron located in the Prairies and it has served the region very well . 
435 Squadron , which moved from Edmonton to Winnipeg in 1994 , has the same fixed - wing capability and equipment as the other three fixed - wing SAR squadrons in Canada . 
additionally , every Canadian Forces aircraft can be used to assist in a SAR mission . 
in the Prairie Region , 417 Squadron in Cold Lake has Griffon helicopters and SAR specialists . These 
rescue personnel can also serve as crew with other Canadian Forces aircraft , including with the Griffon helicopters from 408 Squadron , Edmonton or with the Twin Otters from 440 Squadron , Yellowknife .

the Environment 
reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions - Commitment Made at Kyoto Conference - Consultations Between Prime Minister and Provincial Premiers on Ratification - Government Position 
( response to question raised by Hon. Lowell Murray on December 12 , 1997 ) 
first Ministers had a fulsome discussion on the issue of climate change at their meeting in mid - December . 
they undertook to work together on implementing the Kyoto agreement and directed Energy and Environment Ministers to " work together to consider jointly the appropriate course of action to establish a process , in advance of Canada ' s ratification of the Kyoto Protocol , that will examine the consequences of Kyoto and provide for full participation of provincial and territorial governments with the federal government in any implementation and management of the Protocol . " 
at their meeting on January 29 - 30 , Environment Ministers also agreed that the federal government should take a leadership role on a joint analysis of impacts , and that all jurisdictions will commit the resources necessary to complete this joint analysis . 
provinces did express concern that the federal government did not adopt the " consensus " position of stabilization of greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by 2010 . 
however , they were aware that the purpose of the Regina meeting was to provide advice on the final negotiating position , and that establishment of this position was a federal responsibility . 
the federal government considered the views of the provinces , plus the positioning of the international community in formulating the final negotiating position . 
at this time , it is presumed that Canada will ratify the Kyoto agreement . 
two important considerations will be the development of an effective domestic implementation plan , and the actions of major trading partners with respect to ratification and implementation of measures to meet their commitments . 
the challenge now turns to developing an appropriate policy framework with the federal government ' s partners - the provinces and industry - that encourages energy efficiency and innovation , and enables Canadians to take action on climate change in a way that benefits both the environment and our economy . 
this work is underway . 
transport 
further Imposition of Tolls on Trans - Canada Highway 
( response to question raised by Hon. Donald H . Oliver on December 15 , 1997 ) 
under the Canadian Constitution , highway matters are a provincial responsibility . 
transport Canada ' s only involvement in Highway 104 was to match , dollar for dollar , $ 55 million with the province ( $ 27.5 million each ) . 
the remaining funds were provided by a bond issue to Highway 104 Western Alignment Corporation . 
since highways are a provincial responsibility , there is no requirement for the provinces to inform the federal government of any plans they may have of introducing tolls on their highways . 
nevertheless , it is the federal government ' s understanding that besides the Confederation Bridge and Highway 104 in Nova Scotia , the only other planned toll section of the Trans - Canada Highway is the proposed new section of highway between Fredericton and Moncton , in New Brunswick . 
solicitor General 
publication on Internet of Hate Propaganda and Child Pornography - Public Consultations - Request for Information 
( response to question raised by Hon. Brenda M. Robertson on December 15 , 1997 ) 
federal - Provincial - Territorial Ministers Responsible for Justice discussed the issue of child pornography and hate propaganda on the Internet . 
ministers agreed that this was an area which warranted close attention . 
industry Canada is working with the Canadian Association of Internet Providers ( CAIP ) in developing a voluntary code of conduct that addresses the issue of offensive content ( obscene and hate materials ) and the safety of children . 
under consideration is a Code of Conduct that would be pro - active and provide for public education and awareness measures . 
two milestones on this issue will soon be reached . 
in March 1998 , the OECD is hosting a forum on self - regulation , in Paris , and the federal government will be represented . 
in October 1998 , there is a OECD Ministerial Conference on Electronic Commerce , in Ottawa , and the issue of offensive content is expected to be on the agenda . 
canada ' s criminal legislation dealing with obscenity , pornography , and hate - propaganda already applies the appropriate offences when computers or other hi - tech media are used to create , import or distribute such materials in the same way as when other methods are used . 
the Supreme Court has held that transboundary offences can be prosecuted in Canada if any significant part of the offence took place here ( R . v. Libman , 1985 ) . 
the agenda is currently focused on ensuring that mutual legal assistance and extradition instruments apply to these crimes . 
ministers also asked officials to develop multilateral principles governing the investigation and prosecution of trans - boundary " hi - tech " offences . 
the Eight is also actively working on setting standards for the training of law - enforcement officials and the production of computer evidence in court in order to facilitate multi - jurisdictional investigations and prosecutions . 
minister ' s Report and Annual Statement on Organized Crime - Seniors Victims of Telemarketing Fraud - Request for Clarification 
the Solicitor General has indicated that he considers this to be a very important issue within the context of the overall fight against organized crime , because many frauds are carried out by organized groups operating within and outside Canada . 
it is a serious crime which plays upon the vulnerable members of our society . 
the Government has been involved in numerous initiatives aimed at fighting criminal telemarketing and other fraudulent activity . 
for example , the Canada - United States Binational Group on Telemarketing Fraud was created by Prime Minister Chr � tien and President Clinton following their meeting in April 1997 . 
one of the many recommendations from the Group is that governments work closely with other interested groups in developing and disseminating educational materials , and on coordinating education and prevention efforts . 
the Deceptive Telemarketing Prevention Forum , chaired by Industry Canada , includes members from federal and provincial law enforcement agencies and private industry . 
two of the key objectives of this Forum are to educate the public about deceptive and fraudulent telemarketing practices , and to suggest measures that members of the public can employ to avoid being victimized . 
in addition , the Government has contributed , through the Royal Canadian Mounted Police , to the production of a video entitled " Scams . " 
the video is aimed at educating people about telemarketing fraud , and is currently being shown on television stations in Ontario and British Columbia . 
the Environment 
reduction in Greenhouse Gas Emissions - Ratification of Undertakings made at Kyoto - Commitment Related to Position of United States - Government Position 
( response to question raised by Hon. Lowell Murray on December 16 , 1997 ) 
the ratification of the Kyoto agreement must be authorized by the Federal Cabinet through an Order - in - Council . 
Canadian practice is for the federal government to ratify a treaty only after it is assured that Canada can meet its obligations under the treaty . 
the federal government will not ratify the Kyoto Agreement without broad - based support , without a clear path to implementation and without extensive involvement of provincial and territorial partners . 
a process will be established prior to ratification to provide for full participation of provincial and territorial governments with the federal government in any implementation and management of the Agreement . 
canada will also monitor what its major trading partners are doing to ratify and implement the Kyoto Agreement . 
treasury Board 
millennium Computer Phenomenon - Effect on Government Computers - Government Position 
( response to question raised by Hon. Fernand Roberge on December 16 , 1997 ) 
treasury Board considers the Year 2000 issue to be a high priority and has formulated an aggressive action plan to ensure compliance of key systems across government . 
the government has completed two surveys of all departments and agencies . 
the latest survey indicates that all departments are now 100 % aware of the Year 2000 problem and of its impact on their IT environment and service delivery . 
the role of the Year 2000 Project Office within Treasury Board Secretariat is to provide leadership and assistance to departments to help them accomplish Year 2000 priorities and conversion work . 
computer systems that support delivery of key services - those that are concerned with the health , safety , security and economic well being of Canadians - are the government ' s top priority . 
the loss or interruption of any of these systems , even for a short period , is unacceptable . 
in March of 1997 , the Treasury Board Secretariat contacted all Deputy Ministers and agency heads to assess the progress made so far in preparing for Year 2000 . 
they were asked to provide information on critical systems , external interfaces and system dependencies , the price tag for fixing their computers , and their funding and staff requirements . 
responses showed that most departments were making reasonable progress . 
the remaining departments were encouraged to accelerate their efforts . 
a report by the Auditor General in October expressed concern about the level of preparation by government departments . 
the Auditor General ' s report was based on the assessment of only a small number of departments ( 9 ) and examined the situation as of April 1997 . 
a great deal of progress has been made since then . 
preparation for the changeover continues to be a standing item on the agenda of Deputy Ministers ' meetings . 
in addition , the CIO Year 2000 Project Office has accelerated the pace of its government wide efforts . 
nevertheless , the average completion rate for all departments surveyed was 44 per cent . 
according to the industry benchmark , a large organization should have completed 45 per cent of its conversion work by now to have a reasonable expectation of meeting the Year 2000 deadline . 
because departments differ in size and the extent to which they depend on information technology , the rate of progress within government varies . 
three quarters of the departments offering the most vital services have completed or nearly completed their inventories . 
more than half have developed plans covering the complete scope of Year 2000 problems , and all departments have formal plans in place . 
the CIO Year 2000 Project Office is working on common , horizontal initiatives for departments . 
these efforts include : 
- a dedicated procurement office that has been set up at Public Works and Government Services Canada ( PWGSC ) . 
a Request for Proposal ( RFP ) has been developed , in consultation with the private sector , to secure resources for government departments . 
the new initiatives developed will also expedite the procurement process for departments by at least 8 weeks . 
- steps that are being taken in collaboration with the private sector to ensure that the government can obtain the skilled technical and human resources required . 
in a reversal of normal procedures , qualified students at technical institutions are receiving conditional offers of employment . 
the establishment of government - wide testing facilities . 
- the examination of over 2,500 software and hardware products used throughout government by PWGSC who will have a repository of over 5,000 products by spring of 1998 .

Sable Island Gas Projects - Possibility of Subsidies for Building Spu Pipelines to Additional Areas of the maritime Provinces - Government Position 
( response to question raised by Hon. Eymard G . Corbin on December 16 , 1997 ) 
canada ' s energy policies have evolved significantly over the last decade since the North American deregulation of oil and natural gas prices . 
current energy policy is based on allowing market forces to work . 
although the construction of natural gas pipelines is subject to the necessary federal or provincial regulatory approvals , the federal government does not determine which projects are ultimately constructed . 
to this end , studies are being undertaken , by commercial interests , to determine to what extent natural gas could be used in various regions of eastern Canada . 
the results of these studies will dictate the pace at which secondary natural gas pipelines will be developed . 
as in other regions in Canada where natural gas was introduced , the construction of the Maritimes & Northeast pipeline will undoubtably serve as the impetus to the development of a natural gas distribution networks where natural gas has a competitive advantage over other energy sources . 
government assistance to construct natural gas infrastructure in the 1980 s was one of many initiatives created as part of the National Energy Program ( NEP ) . 
this program was created in an era when security of energy supply was a major concern . 
at that time , a number of programs within the NEP were designed specifically to address the energy needs of Atlantic Canada .

bay of Fundy - Destruction of Infected Salmon on Fish Farms - Progress in Establishing Recovery Program for Growers - Government Position 
( response to question raised by Hon. Brenda M. Robertson on December 17 , 1997 ) 
on December 11 , 1997 , New Brunswick Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture , the Honourable Donald D . Gay , announced measures to control Infectious Salmon Anemia ( ISA ) in farmed salmon in the Bay of Fundy . 
this included issuing an order to eradicate all 1997 year - class salmon at clinically affected cages . 
it is the federal government ' s view that the Province has acted appropriately and within its jurisdiction , given its responsibilities for controlling diseases in its fish farms , as set out in the New Brunswick Aquaculture Act . 
the federal government agrees with the Province that ISA poses no threat to human health , and would also point out that ISA poses no demonstrated risk to wild fish stocks , or to cultured stocks in other provinces . 
for these reasons , the federal government is not mandated to provide compensation for this preventive eradication action under any of its legislation ( the Fisheries Act and the Health of Animals Act ) . 
existing infrastructure support programming of the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency , as well as access to financing provided by the Farm Credit Corporation , remain available to eligible salmon growers for industry recovery purposes . 
in addition , the Department of Fisheries and Oceans has dedicated over $ 100 K in the 1997 - 98 fiscal year to scientific research on the ISA problem , and will continue to provide scientific research services to salmon growers .

request for Funding to Develop Vaccine for Flesh - east Disease - Government Position 
( response to question raised by Hon. Stanley Haidasz on December 18 , 1997 ) 
Dr. Maxwell Richter , Chief of Immunology , Ottawa Civic hospital has written to a former Minister of Health ( Diane Marleau ) on two occasions ( August 16 , 1995 and October 25 , 1995 ) . 
the Department is committed to an action plan to address this problem . 
in fact , a Consensus Conference on " Controlling Antimicrobial Resistance : 
health Canada in conjunction with the Canadian Infectious Disease Society organized the meeting held in Montreal . 
approximately 200 participants represented a wide constituency of stakeholders including the consumer , professional organizations and the media . 
the implementation of the final recommendations will result in a National Strategy to improve the benefits of antibiotics and reduce the risks associated with our current use .

bay of Fundy - Destruction of Infected Salmon on Fish Farms - Arrangements for Control of Outbreak - Government Position 
( response to question raised by Hon. Janis Johnson on December 18 , 1997 ) 
on December 11 , 1997 , New Brunswick Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture , the Honourable Donald D . Gay , announced measures to control Infectious Salmon Anemia ( ISA ) in farmed salmon in the Bay of Fundy . 
this included issuing an order to eradicate all 1997 year - class salmon at clinically affected cages . 
it is the federal government ' s view that the Province has acted appropriately and within its jurisdiction , given its responsibilities for controlling diseases in its fish farms , as set out in the New Brunswick Aquaculture Act . 
it is too soon to tell whether the Province ' s control measures have worked . 
however , when used in combination with other measures such as separation of salmon year classes and disinfection of slaughterhouse effluents , eradication has proved effective in arresting similar outbreaks in Norway . 
there is no evidence that this outbreak is occurring in other parts of Atlantic Canada . 
however , there are reports that salmon growers in the State of Maine are finding evidence of ISA in some of their operations . 
the federal government agrees with the Province that ISA poses no threat to human health , and would also point out that ISA poses no demonstrated risk to wild fish stocks or to cultured stocks in other provinces . 
for these reasons , the federal government is not mandated to provide compensation for this preventive eradication action under any of its legislation ( the Fisheries Act , and the Health of Animals Act ) . 
existing infrastructure support programming of the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency , as well as access to financing provided by the Farm Credit Corporation , remain available to eligible salmon growers for industry recovery purposes .

orders OF THE DAY 
excise Tax Act 
bill to Amend - Second Reading - Debate Adjourned 
honourable senators , I rise today to begin debate on second reading of Bill S - 10 , to amend the Excise Tax Act . 
as you are probably well aware , Canada is one of the few industrialized countries that taxes reading material . 
the United States has no such system , nor do Australia , Great Britain or Japan . 
it is my hope that Canada will soon join these other countries and follow the lead of the European Parliament , which banished such taxes a couple of years ago . 
honourable senators , the issue of the GST is one that has been filled with acrimony since it was proposed . 
much has been said and denied on both sides of this chamber . 
it is my hope that this bill will be allowed to escape this animosity , despite what has been said in the past . 
in this vein , my remarks will not be partisan , for my intention is not political . 
my objective is to appeal to common sense , to good politics . 
we have told Canadians that we oppose taxing reading material and that we would like to see it stopped . 
we owe it to ourselves to act on that commitment . 
when I look about me today , I think I can say with a fair degree of certainty that there are few if any of us in this chamber who seriously oppose the principle of this bill . 
we know through our work and our contacts within our respective communities that many people want the GST on reading material removed , so many , in fact , that I do not think I would be incorrect to suggest that a consensus has emerged in this country in favour of such an action . 
i do not mean a consensus among interested parties only . 
obviously groups directly affected by the tax , such as the Association of Canadian Publishers , the Canadian Booksellers Association and the Canadian Daily Newspapers Association , all support the idea . 
however , those groups alone do not make a national consensus . 
for this you need people , lots of them . 
i think such a group of people exists . 
they are from all walks of life and every part of Canada . 
they are people who have stated repeatedly , " Yes , we can live with a broad - based consumption tax , but , no , we are opposed to taxing reading material . " 
the desire of these many Canadians to see the GST on reading material removed has been echoed here in Ottawa . 
members of all parties have , at different times and to different degrees , endorsed the idea . 
more important , at this particular juncture of our national history , the Liberal Party , indeed the entire Liberal family , clearly supports the idea . 
in 1992 , the Prime Minister , then leader of the Liberal Party , wrote the Don ' t Tax Reading Coalition . 
in his letter he reiterated his party ' s recent policy resolution calling for the removal of the GST on reading material . 
i am extremely happy to see that the honourable senator still feels strongly about this issue , and I hope that she will vote for this bill . 
i am equally hopeful that Senator Corbin , now that his previous objections have been overcome , will see fit to vote in favour of it . 
in addition to the Prime Minister , members of his cabinet and Liberal senators , there is the Liberal caucus . 
i read recently that over one - half of the previous caucus was on record as supporting the principle enunciated in this bill . 
it seems unlikely that these numbers have changed drastically since the last election . 
of course , there are also Liberal premiers like Brian Tobin . 
the Premier of Newfoundland is a strong supporter of removing the GST from reading material . 
i seem to remember he was particularly eloquent on speaking about this issue , saying something to the effect that taxing reading was a violation of the concept of freedom of speech . 
i would be very surprised if he has since changed his mind . 
last , but not least , are the different liberal newspapers in this country . 
i am certain that The Toronto Star and other papers have printed any number of articles and editorials in favour of abolishing the GST on reading material . 
honourable senators , when you add it all up , support for this bill is quite widespread . 
for the longest time , Mr. Martin told Canadians that to chop the GST on reading material would be too expensive . 
he said it would cost the treasury something in the area of $ 140 million , and that we simply could not afford it . 
however , as I pointed out before , and as the Auditor General points out every year , $ 140 million is easily found when boondoggles and political spending are properly controlled . 
Mr. Martin ' s arguments are further undermined by the close attention he has paid to lowering the country ' s deficit . 
for the first time in many years , Canadians are seeing the light at the end of the deficit tunnel . 
i do not wish to get into a long and detailed description of the economic benefits of abolishing the GST on reading material . 
i am sure most of you are aware of all of these . 
suffice it to say that , as it stands now , the GST on reading material is a tax both on reading and on learning ; therefore it is a tax on investment . 
this is never a good idea . 
it is also , in some ways , a tax on jobs . 
eliminating the GST on reading material will bring increased sales to a host of businesses , including magazine publishers , printing companies and bookstores . 
this means more jobs ; jobs for the , unfortunately , still high number of unemployed , particularly among the young . 
a further point I should like to make concerns literacy or the lack thereof . 
a recent OECD study indicates that 42 per cent of Canadians are presently below minimum literacy standards . 
an additional 34 per cent can only use simple reading material . 
in the Maritimes , as Senator DeWare advised before Christmas , illiteracy rates are 20 per cent higher than the national averages . 
in Ontario , something called the International Adult Literacy Survey has shown that 20 per cent of the province ' s adults have no basic literacy skills , and an additional 24 per cent have poor skills . 
i am sure you will all agree that these figures are startling . 
they should give all of us pause to reflect , and to ask ourselves what it means when over one - third of our fellow citizens have difficulty reading . 
we should be asking ourselves what are the consequences , who are the losers , and what can be done to rectify the situation . 
questions like these and the statistics that provoke them underline the fact that literacy is not simply a question of how much tax is applied to books or magazines , nor is it just about who can or cannot read . 
in reality , it is a far more wide - ranging issue , one directly linked to our economic self - interest . 
broadly speaking , this is because literacy affects our productivity . 
it affects our competitiveness . 
it influences our ability to do business successfully in the global economy . 
in short , an uneducated or undereducated workforce is an impediment to our progress and a drag on our national economic well - being . 
it is therefore vital that we ensure that our fellow citizens know how to read . 
here we get to the crux of the issue . 
if we wish to encourage people to read more , we must ensure that they have easy and affordable access to reading material . 
it makes good sense . 
we must stop taxing those materials that they use most , whether it be newspapers , magazines , books , or other reading material . 
this is particularly true for our youth . 
young people are our future . 
they are our single most important asset . 
for them , far more than was the case for our generation , literacy is crucial to a successful life and a profitable career , largely because our economy has evolved . 
today , it is based on service and technology . 
each of these areas demands a high rate of literacy and the ability to think and write clearly and coherently . 
i hardly need remind you of the important role reading plays in the acquisition of these skills . 
if we are to encourage our young people to read and keep reading , then we must ensure that they have access to the materials they need at affordable prices . 
i would summarize my remarks by saying that taxes , consumption or otherwise , are a necessary evil . 
they provide for the many services we have and need in our society . 
however , taxes on reading material should be exempt from this general rule . 
this is no longer the case , as I mentioned a moment ago . 
in any case , it is not a question of affordability ; it is one of spending priorities . 
the removal of the GST from reading material is , or should be , a priority . 
it makes economic sense . 
equally important , literate citizens make for a better and more informed democracy , and that is a goal towards which we can all strive , independent of partisanship . 
i should like to conclude by urging honourable senators opposite to give concrete expression to their public support and their party ' s long - standing promise regarding this issue . 
let us send a strong message to the Minister of Finance that removal of the GST on reading material should be one of the first dividends Canadians receive from the elimination of the deficit . 
i urge you to show your commitment to literacy and to the future well - being of the young people in our country by voting in favour of this bill . 
on motion of Senator Carstairs , for Senator Adams , debate adjourned .

that the Committee present its final report no later than April 15 , 1998 . - ( Honourable Senator Carstairs ) . 
hon. William M. Kelly : 
honourable senators , I believe it is possible for me to do what I am about to do . 
i should like to adjourn further debate on this motion until Tuesday - 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable Senator Kelly , if you do that , you preclude any other senator from speaking . 
this is your motion . 
senator Kelly : 
honourable senators , there are reasons why it would not be possible for this matter to be discussed before the week of March 3 . 
i am persuaded that if I can adjourn the order at this stage , then the numbers do not move from 8 to 15 , which they will do before March 3 . 
this would put the order in limbo until March 3 . 
if you feel I am fully out of order , please consult the Deputy Clerk , because he is the one who has told me to do this . 
senator Carstairs : 
since this order now stands adjourned in my name , perhaps it would be possible for me to ask the Senate if we could adjourn debate on this motion until March 3 ? 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
is it agreed , honourable senators ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
on motion of Senator Carstairs , debated adjourned . 
reports on Social and Economic Development 
inquiry - Debate Adjourned 
hon. No � l A . Kinsella rose pursuant to notice of December 4 , 1997 : 
honourable senators , I should like to say a few words , and then I will adjourn the debate on this inquiry . 
honourable senators , the particular report to which I wish to call the attention of the Senate is a report that Canada has submitted to the United Nations pursuant to the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights . 
that report constitutes the manner in which Canada meets its obligation under that international human rights treaty . 
this particular report , and a number of other reports that Canada submits to international bodies to which we are members , are excellent reports in many instances . 
however , unfortunately , very few Canadians are aware of those reports . 
last fall , a number of the members of this house joined with members from the other place in participating as Canadian parliamentarians in a hemispheric conference of parliamentarians that was held in Quebec City . 
at the end of the conference , which had as one of its themes the study of the protection and the promotion of human rights in the hemisphere , we took note of the fact that many of the countries - indeed , all of the countries of the hemisphere - are parties to one or another of these international human rights treaties which require the state party to submit a report . 
the Quebec conference of the hemisphere agreed that we , in our respective countries and Parliaments , should give attention to the reports that our own countries are submitting to these oversight committees . 
this particular report is a very important report . 
it is speaks to and provides a detailed analysis of the steps that Canada has taken , whether federally , provincially or territorially , to meet its obligations in the area of economic , social and cultural rights . 
we do the same thing ; we submit a country report with the collaboration of all the provinces and the two territories , under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights . 
honourable senators , this particular report that we submit periodically is especially important when one considers that economic , social and cultural rights , such as the right to education or the right to health , require the intervention of the state , whereas rights such as freedom from arbitrary arrest or freedom of the press , in effect , are self - executory . 
what they require is that the state or people in power do not interfere with those rights in order for them to be enjoyed . 
this report , on social , economic and cultural rights in Canada , on issues such as what steps we have taken to promote or guarantee to give meaning to the right to education , is a report prepared by the provinces , territories and also a section prepared by the federal government . 
it is an excellent view of the situation ; of the progress that Canada has made , all the partners in our confederation , towards the fulfilment and the giving of greater meaning to economic , social and cultural rights . 
that report is very much a social audit . 
just as we have an audit in fiscal matters , the report of the Auditor General is only as good as the debate that it stimulates in the House of Commons or in this place . 
being also a social audit , this model of soft justiciability is nevertheless a method of implementation , promotion and protection . 
it is important that we begin to look at these reports that Canada is submitting . 
on motion of Senator Carstairs , debate adjourned . 
canada Marine Bill 
second Reading - Debate Adjourned 
leave having been given to return to Government Order No. 2 : 
honourable senators , it is a pleasure to speak to you today on a bill that will prepare maritime transport in Canada to face the challenges of the 21 st century . 
this bill is the result of two and a half years of major consultations with shippers , carriers , other levels of government and commercial associations . 
it has considerable support from the marine transport sector . 
the bill is being reintroduced as a priority of the government after undergoing a number of major changes in the last legislature in response to suggestions and concerns expressed by the various partners . 
this legislation provides a new outlook and direction for many of our key marine institutions and facilities . 
the government ' s objective is to strengthen the Canadian economy and to establish a climate favouring job creation and investment . 
only with a solid economic base will we be able to maintain the living standard we have taken for granted . 
in support of this goal , the government has taken steps to modernize Canada ' s transportation network . 
to this end , it has commercialized transport activities , eliminated useless subsidies and changed legislation . 
in all forms of transport - air , surface and marine - we have made great progress toward greater efficiency , more power to system users and greater local and regional autonomy . 
a lot has been done , but we have yet to put in place the benefits of these improvements for the marine sector . 
turning to ports , the 1995 national marine policy calls for the federal government to focus on ports that are vital to domestic and international trade , and to preserve access to remote regions . 
the remaining ports are being transferred to local interests which are in a better position to manage them efficiently and in response to local needs . 
to become a Canada Port Authority , a port must be financially self - sufficient , have diversified traffic , have strategic significance to Canada ' s trade , and have a link to a major railway line or highway . 
port authorities will be incorporated or continued by letters patent for the purpose of operating a particular port . 
they will have power to engage in activities related to shipping , navigation , transportation of passengers and goods , and handling and storage of goods , as well as other activities deemed necessary to support port operations . 
each board of directors will be composed of between seven and eleven members and will select its own chief executive officer . 
the majority of each board will be appointed by the federal government after consultation with port users . 
the remaining directors will be appointed by the municipality or municipalities adjacent to the facility , involved provinces and the Government of Canada . 
perhaps the most important accountability mechanism in the bill is the provision that representatives of ports must approach the private sector for financing . 
as a result , all port development projects requiring investment will be subject to commercial risk assessment . 
during the last Parliament the biggest change introduced by the House was to give the new port authorities crown agent status for their core activities . 
crown agent status gives port authorities a clear exemption from property taxation and would enable them to be covered by the municipal grants act . 
then they will pay grants in lieu of taxes to the municipalities at the same levels as other federal facilities and installations . 
in most cases , this represents a continuation of the status quo . 
any new obligations arising from agent status would come mainly to the federal government and not the agent . 
that is why the bill was amended to clarify the restrictions that would apply to port authorities with crown agent status . 
for example , crown agent status does not apply to non - core activities that ports may undertake . 
to make sure third parties know when they are dealing with a crown agent , the legislation requires port authorities to make this clear in all contracts signed as non - agents . 
the bill prohibits ports from borrowing as crown agents and requires them to borrow in their own name and not in the name of the crown . 
this emphasizes to lenders that the crown does not stand behind these obligations . 
the need to borrow must be justified on a commercial basis . 
turning to the issue of divestiture , most public ports administered by Ports Canada are regional ports performing operations which range from large facilities supporting significant commercial activity to small facilities with little or no commercial traffic . 
the government ' s intention over the next four years is to continue with the transfer of such ports to local management . 
at the same time , the government is sensitive to the special concerns from some sectors about the future of ports . 
many options exist for the future of ports aside from transfer to the private sector . 
provincial , municipal and community groups can develop innovative arrangements . 
the government is providing a $ 125 million port divestiture fund to facilitate the transition . 
it is important to note that the Minister of Transport will report back to Parliament every year during the transition program to explain the status of port transfers , and the minister will continue to manage all public ports that are not transferred . 
the second initiative I will address is the part of the legislation that will permit us to commercialize the operation of the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence seaway system . 
this system is a crucial waterway but it is also a business . 
the seaway faces formidable challenges , including high asset renewal costs . 
bill C - 9 enables the minister to enter into agreements with a not - for - profit corporation or any other private sector interests to operate and maintain all or part of the seaway . 
the federal government would retain regulatory control over navigation in the seaway . 
the existing seaway authority would be dissolved in due course . 
the new , not - for - profit seaway corporation would be responsible for operating and maintaining the seaway system and for asset renewal costs up to a specified limit , with incentives in place to achieve operating efficiencies and lower costs . 
transport Canada is negotiating the transfer of seaway operations with groups representing the major shippers and carriers on the seaway . 
the more efficient they are in the management , the less fees they will pay to use the seaway . 
having the users of the system performing operational and management tasks will help to make the seaway a more efficient and competitive link with our international trading partners . 
the government believes that the user - based , not - for - profit corporation is best suited to take over the system because users want to minimize their seaway tolls and ensure the long term integrity of the system . 
in particular , the steel industry and the marine carriers require the seaway for their long - term survival . 
honourable colleagues , the government also remains committed to the long term integrity of the St. Lawrence Seaway . 
safeguards in the agreement will ensure sufficient asset renewal to protect Canada ' s interest in the system . 
third , Bill C - 9 allows the Minister of Transport to improve the way pilotage authorities operate in Canada . 
this bill will make it possible for the authorities to recover their costs from those who use their services . 
it will also streamline the appeals process for new pilotage rates and provide a mechanism for settling disputes concerning the contract renewal process . 
it will also require the minister to review pilotage issues and report his findings to Parliament . 
next , human resources . 
in preparing these changes , priority was placed on ensuring that all employees affected by the changes are treated fairly , and that the appropriate Canada Labour Code requirements are observed fully . 
government has taken the position that marine employees who are now members of federal pension and benefit plans will be covered under comparable replacement arrangements when they are transferred . 
the result is that marine employees leaving the federal plans will be offered comparable benefits until such time as they and the new employer agree to changes . 
honourable senators , the bill also requires the new employer to take all reasonable steps to negotiate a pension transfer agreement with Treasury Board . 
pension transfers and pension transfer agreements would allow benefits to continue to grow as service time accumulates with the new employer . 
in conclusion , honourable senators , I should like to point out that Bill C - 9 meets the goals of the national marine policy and strikes a balance in how we manage our marine institutions and facilities . 
hon. J . Michael Forrestall : 
honourable senators , I appreciate very much the introductory remarks of our colleague . 
we on this side look forward to getting at this bill . 
we remain somewhat disappointed and discouraged with the way in which it was handled in the other place . 
there was neither sufficient time for the calling of adequate witnesses nor for the exposure of the more sensitive parts of some of the areas upon which the senator has just now touched . 
we will want to have this bill examined , but not in all respects . 
we can certainly deal with some of its aspects because they are straightforward , and we do have a history of process and procedure with respect to them . 
however , with respect to the ports themselves , the seaway and the expansion of liability , and so on - I can think of 10 or 12 items immediately - we reserve the right to advise you at this time and to act accordingly . 
we will want the standing committee to call witnesses . 
we also reserve the right , should it be necessary - and I have a strong feeling that it will be , particularly with respect to the ports - for the standing committee to do some travel in relation to this legislation . 
the bill has been a long time in preparation . 
this bill is too important to hurry . 
it may need some recommendations for changes , but we will not know that until we have examined it , particularly in concert with the community of marine users in Canada .

senators ' STATEMENTS 
the Senate 
yesterday ' s Attendance 
hon. Marie - P . 
honourable senators , I am pleased to see some members of the press in the gallery today . 
as chair of the Senate Liberal caucus , as a member of the Senate and as a former broadcaster , I welcome and appreciate the interest that is being shown in our work . 
as we know , there are 104 seats in the Senate of Canada . 
currently , four are vacant . 
out of 100 sitting senators , 75 were in the chamber yesterday while 11 were holding hearings as members of the Standing Senate Committee on Banking , Trade and Commerce . 
that is , 86 senators out of 100 were present , an 86 per cent attendance rate . 
that is not the 60 per cent rate indicated by some journalists this morning . 
i thought I would set the record straight . 
telecommunications 
Rogers Cablevision - Unjustified Raise in Service Charges 
hon. Jean - Robert Gauthier : 
honourable senators , I am grappling with an illness that it takes time to cure , but the time will come . 
i would first like to thank all of you who through your expressions of sympathy , by letter , by telephone or in person , have helped me through these very difficult years . 
this disease , which has had me in its grip for nearly two years , seems to be under control . 
as you can see , there have been improvements . 
the point of my remarks today , honourable senators , is to make you aware of a situation I consider unjustifiable and unacceptable . 
Rogers Cable is going to impose unacceptable rate hikes on all its subscribers . 
this is an unjustified increase in service charges . 
in order to put a better face on things , Rogers will suspend this increase for a year if the subscriber signs up for a new group of channels which the company has dubbed MeTV . 
Rogers loses absolutely nothing in the deal . 
as you know , the Rogers monopoly is currently experiencing serious financial difficulties and it hopes to overcome those difficulties by imposing an additional charge on taxpayers . 
you will note as well that there will be only one French - language channel in this MeTV package , Canal famille . 
i have written to Ted Rogers as well as to Fran � oise Bertrand , the Chairman of the CRTC , to protest this increase and to demand its immediate withdrawal . 
it is unacceptable and reprehensible that a monopoly like Rogers Cable can impose a surcharge after the fact . 
who is protecting the consumers ? 
we have recently learned that the minister responsible for this matter , Sheila Copps , has washed her hands of it . 
she will not interfere either . 
so whom can the consumer turn to for protection ? 
whom are we to contact ? 
routine PROCEEDINGS 
privileges , Standing Rules and Orders 
senator Andrew Thompson - Second Report of Committee Presented and Considered - Debate Adjourned 
hon. Shirley Maheu , Chair of the Standing Committee on Privileges , Standing Rules and Orders , presented the following report : 
Wednesday , February 11 , 1998 
the Standing Committee on Privileges , Standing Rules and Orders has the honour to present its 
second REPORT 
on December 16 , 1997 , the Senate ordered Senator Andrew Thompson to attend in his place when the Senate resumed sitting in February 1998 following the Christmas adjournment . 
a letter dated December 18 , 1997 , from the Clerk of the Senate , enclosing a certified true copy of this order , was personally served on Senator Thompson . 
pursuant to the terms of the December 16 , 1997 Senate order , since Senator Thompson failed to attend the Senate , the matter of his continuing absence is now referred to the Standing Committee on Privileges , Standing Rules and Orders for the purposes of determining whether his absence constitutes a contempt of the Senate . 
the Committee is to report its findings and any possible recommendations within two weeks from the day the matter was referred to it . 
the Committee met on February 10 , 1997 , when the Senate rose , to consider this matter . 
this is based on the traditions of the Senate , and a desire that he be given every reasonable opportunity to provide an explanation or any relevant information and present reasons as to why his actions did not constitute a contempt the Senate . 
that the Honourable Senator Andrew Thompson be ordered to attend before the Standing Committee on Privileges , Standing Rules and Orders at its next meeting scheduled for Wednesday , February 18 , 1998 , at 7:00 p.m. in Room 160 - S . 
respectfully submitted , 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , when shall this report be taken into consideration ? 
senator Maheu : 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , is leave granted ? 
hon. Edward M. Lawson : 
honourable senators , while listening to the CBC news this morning , I heard an interview with Senator Rompkey on the subject of this report . 
how does it come about that a senator can make a public announcement of a committee ' s decision and a penalty to be imposed before the committee has had the opportunity to have its hearing ? 
the constitutional experts say that this penalty is not achievable . 
is this merely Senator Rompkey pre - empting the committee , or had the committee made a decision before holding the hearing ? 
second , the Clerk of the Senate is quoted as saying that , in the fall , Senator Thompson filed with the Senate a report from his doctor which indicated that for six months Senator Thompson would not be well enough to come to the Senate . 
every other senator facing a serious medical problem has followed this same procedure in the past . 
is the committee or the Senate now challenging Senator Thompson ' s doctor ? 
are we substituting the opinion of a reporter who saw Senator Thompson walking his dog and concluded that the senator was in good health ? 
that was the reporter ' s medical opinion . 
are there any other senators on medical leave of a similar nature with medical reports from their doctors ? 
is the committee or the Senate challenging their medical reports , and if not , why not ? 
senator Maheu : 
honourable senators , no decision has been taken by the committee . 
eighteen members sat last night and listened to possibilities and legal ramifications to determine whether we have that right and to find out what is contempt of the Senate . 
the question that we were discussing last night and the reason for our letter is not the absenteeism but the contempt of the Senate . 
we are dealing strictly with that one point for now , although the committee ' s order of reference from the Senate goes a little further . 
we did not question the doctor ' s report . 
i do not think anyone on that committee would put the doctor ' s report in question . 
it was not a subject of discussion . 
doctors ' reports have been filed , but we did not put them into question last night . 
we are not challenging them at all , and as far as I know , no one else is being challenged in either the Internal Economy Committee or the Rules Committee . 
i do not know of another senator who falls into the same category . 
the committee is merely requesting that Senator Thompson come and tell us why he has not appeared , why he will not listen to an order from the Senate , why he will not answer any mail that we have forwarded to him , even mail delivered by hand with a notary public ' s letter accompanying it . 
does that answer the questions ? 
senator Lawson : 
is the answer contained in the doctor ' s letter ? 
senator Maheu : 
we do not know . 
senator Lawson : 
the doctor says that he is not able nor well enough to be here for six months , effective November . 
senator Maheu : 
that has nothing to do with contempt . 
senator Lawson : 
what is the basis of the contempt ? 
senator Maheu : 
that is what we are considering . 
motion in Amendment 
hon. Ron Ghitter : 
that the report be amended by deleting all of the words following the second paragraph and substituting thereof the following : 
that Senator Andrew Thompson be expelled from the Senate forthwith and that no further amounts be remitted to him for either his sessional indemnity or incidental expense allowance . 
senator Lynch - Staunton : 
that will take care of it . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
it is moved by the Honourable Senator Ghitter , seconded by the Honourable Senator Stratton : 
that the report of the Rules Committee be amended by deleting all but the preamble , and that the following be substituted therefor : 
that Senator Andrew Thompson be expelled from the Senate forthwith , and no further amounts be remitted to him for either his sessional indemnity or incidental expense allowance . 
is it your pleasure , honourable senators , to adopt the motion in amendment ? 
senator Ghitter : 
honourable senators , I should like to speak to the amendment , if I may . 
i do not take what I am suggesting lightly or without due regard for the very serious nature of this motion . 
in fact , I know of no other such act that has ever been taken in this chamber . 
i have never met Senator Thompson , and those who know him have told me that he is a very pleasant and gracious individual . 
however , the point of the matter is that he has brought this institution into disrepute , he has ignored the order of the Senate , and he has outrageously abused the privileges of this place . 
let me first explain the legal basis upon which I regard this institution as having the authority to expel a member . 
section 18 of the Constitution Act , 1867 , reads as follows . 
the privileges , immunities , and powers to be held , enjoyed , and exercised by the Senate and by the House of Commons , and by the Members thereof respectively , shall be such as are from time to time defined by Act of the Parliament of Canada , but so that any Act of the Parliament of Canada defining such privileges , immunities , and powers shall not confer any privileges , immunities , or powers exceeding those at the passing of such Act held , enjoyed , and exercised by the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland , and by the Members thereof . 
in dealing with the matter of expulsion , Beauchesne states as follows on page 16 of the 6 th edition , at paragraph 47 : 
that is , a member of the House of Commons . 
... to run again and be re - elected . 
then it carries on to speak of two occasions in the history of the House of Commons where there has been expulsion . 
most of us know of the situation of Louis Riel , and those who are familiar with Nova Scotia will know of the expulsion that took place in the legislature in Nova Scotia . 
there is no doubt in my mind that this chamber has the authority to expel a member . 
this is not a remedy to be used in a frivolous or a political manner . 
it is a remedy of last resort , in my opinion , and it is an action that should only be taken in the most grievous of circumstances . 
in my mind , and in my submission before you today , this is one of those situations . 
let me give you the reasons . 
i have before me the attendance record of the Honourable Andrew Thompson for the years 1980 to 1997 . 
until 1984 it seems his attendance was reasonable . 
i do not profess that everyone can be here all the time , nor should we be . 
it does not hurt to be in our communities . 
there is no perfect standard for attendance . 
it ridicules the Senate and is inappropriate , and a person in this situation should certainly resign . 
with regard to whether or not an individual should sit in the Senate , it is my submission today that Andrew Thompson ' s actions have brought the Senate into tremendous disrepute in the eyes of Canadians and have severely damaged the work and reputation of the Senate of Canada . 
all one needs do - and you have all read the editorials - is examine what people are saying about the Senate . 
that is not to say that before people were always saying favourable things about the Senate . 
that is not to say that this is a perfect institution with a perfect reputation . 
indeed , it is not . 
however , what Senator Thompson has done by his actions and by thumbing his nose at the Senate - and I will come to that in a moment - has become a lightning rod that has brought this institution and its work into great and tremendous disrepute . 
all of us in this chamber who believe in the Senate cannot and must not sit by and do nothing while this is occurring . 
let me read for the record some of the highlights of what is being said about the Senate as a result of the actions of Senator Thompson . 
early on , The Ottawa Citizen of October , 1997 , sported the headline : " Top Senate Truant Wants to Keep His Job . " 
next , in November of that same year , The Ottawa Citizen had the headline : " Searching for Mr. Thompson " : 
Mr. Thompson who was appointed to the Senate in 1967 , was booted out of the Liberal caucus Wednesday by Prime Minister Chr � tien ... 
good for Prime Minister Chr � tien ! 
between 1990 and this fall , he showed up a total of 12 times out of 459 sittings in the past two Parliaments - just enough times to collect his annual salary of $ 64,000 plus a $ 10,000 tax - free expense allowance . 
next , The Edmonton Journal in November : " Long Absences Bring Shame to the Senate . " 
this editorial states : 
being named to the Canadian Senate is a national honour . 
senators are given a guaranteed job till age 75 , with all the money and perks that national office bestows . 
in return , the Canadian people should at least be able to expect honourable behaviour from its senators . 
and later on it states : 
the great frustration with the Senate is the fact that real change - either an elected Senate or total abolition - is impossible because of our constitutional gridlock . 
we seem destined to be burdened with this embarrassing institution for years to come . 
that gridlock , however , is no excuse for the senators themselves not to tighten their rules . 
by setting higher standards , they could signal that the Senate is no longer a free ride . 
they might even convince Canadians the institution is worth preserving . 
yes , Sen . Thompson has become this year ' s poster boy for all that ' s said to be wrong with the chamber of sober second income . 
the Toronto Sun : " Adios , " it says : 
as for his service to Canadians , well , only a cynic would say that Thompson ' s career as no - show hasn ' t delivered . 
on the contrary , he may have succeeded where years of debate and endless rounds of constitutional talks have failed - that is , by convincing Canadians the Senate is a farce that must be overhauled or , better yet , abolished . 
the Ottawa Citizen : " At home with Senator Thompson , " is the heading , as it visits Mexico and describes the lifestyle . 
a lengthy article in The Globe and Mail , wherein Senator Thompson is saying , " I really do not care what they are saying about me . " 
he then speaks about the Senate , and he speaks of his disdain of the institution . 
that article states : 
he had few kind words about the Senate - 
" he " being Senator Thompson - 
- which he says is desperately in need of reform . 
" it could be so effective in helping people . 
it ' s like a morgue , " 
so says Senator Thompson . 
on and on it goes . 
honourable senators , I am sure , have all read it . 
i could go on all afternoon , reading what is being said about the Senate . 
however , honourable senators , it is not just what the media is saying about the Senate , not for one moment . 
it is what Main Street Canada is saying about the Senate . 
it is what we hear when we go home . 
it is the comments we receive from people , even our friends who jokingly say : " Why are you here ? 
why are you not in Mexico ? " 
we have all heard those comments , and we all know how demeaning this situation has become , from the point of view of this institution that we very much believe in and that we serve . 
what does Senator Thompson do ? 
when the Senate gives him that opportunity , and after a resolution that was passed in this chamber , he is then personally served with a document that says to him , " You shall appear by order of the Senate when it opens in February . " 
he is served with that document personally . 
honourable senators , have we heard from Senator Thompson ? 
did he come yesterday ? 
have we seen a lawyer , a doctor , a letter , or anything ? 
will he plead that he has not received the document when he was personally served with it ? 
will he say : " I did not know when the Senate would start . 
i had a document , but it did not say February 10 , so I do not know " ? 
is that credible ? 
of course it is not . 
what has our colleague Senator Thompson done to us ? 
i will not use the parlance of the street , but let us just say he thumbed his nose at us . 
he has thrown sand in our face , and he says that the Senate is a morgue for which he has no regard - not that he is here to help it any . 
he could not care less about this place . 
honourable senators , here we are today , talking in legal niceties about another order and serving him again . 
we say , " Let us be fair ; let us do all these things . " 
i say enough is enough . 
i say it is time that we showed some guts in this place . 
you are expelled . 
you will no longer abuse the privileges of this house and bring this house into disfavour . " 
some Hon Senators : 
hear , hear ! 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , before I can permit any further debate , I must ask for some clarification from Honourable Senator Ghitter . 
if I understood him correctly , when he rose and gave the amendment he said " After the two first paragraphs ... " 
however , the motion that he sent me in writing says , " ... deleting all but the preamble . " 
i must have clarification as to which one is correct . 
senator Ghitter : 
confusion arose in that I did not see the material until it was just presented to me . 
the amendment relates to what was said by me , not what is in writing . 
after the first two paragraphs , everything should be deleted , and the amendment that I have described should be put in its place . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , is it agreed that we will change what I have read to what Senator Ghitter wants , as he describes it " after the first two paragraphs " ? 
some Hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
point of Order 
hon. Shirley Maheu : 
honourable senators , I rise on a point of order . 
the last four words in the suggested amendment by Senator Ghitter are obsolete , since the incidental expense allowance has already been cancelled . 
perhaps the Clerk could clarify that . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
are there any other comments on the point of order raised by Senator Maheu ? 
honourable senators , I believe that the Honourable Senator Maheu ' s point is valid . 
to simplify the situation , is it agreed that we delete " or incidental expense allowance " ? 
some Hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
hon. John Lynch - Staunton ( Leader of the Opposition ) : 
i think that Senator Ghitter wanted to include the tax - free monthly allowance that senators receive . 
i believe that is what he intended , not the general expenses for running the office . 
i think we would all agree that those last words be deleted and replaced with the words " special indemnity and tax - free allowance . " 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , rather than get into more points of order , can we have agreement to do that - delete " or incidental expense allowance " and replace it with the words " or tax - free allowance " ? 
is that agreeable ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , I am advised that the time allotted to the Honourable Senator Ghitter has expired . 
there can be no questions to him , except with leave of the Senate . 
is such leave granted ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
hon. Paul Lucier : 
honourable senators , far be it from me to stand here in this chamber and defend Senator Thompson or his behaviour . 
i believe that his behaviour has been to the discredit to all of us . 
i do not think it was necessary . 
the man lives in Toronto , and he could have found his way here at least a few times over the years . 
however , honourable senators , I have a problem with the way in which we are dealing with this issue . 
we keep referring to Senator Thompson ' s attendance . 
senator Thompson had legal , doctor ' s certificates , many of them , before the Clerk of the Senate covering his days of absence . 
last night our legal counsel , Mr. Audcent , made a very good presentation before the Rules Committee and pointed out very clearly that the Parliament of Canada Act , wherein is discussed Senate attendance , makes it very clear that when a senator has a doctor ' s certificate and is away for medical reasons , he is in attendance . 
he is not absent . 
for every day that Senator Thompson had a legal medical certificate before the Senate and the Clerk of the Senate stating that he was away because of illness , he was in attendance . 
honourable senators , I do not want to speak about the issue of contempt . 
i believe there may be a case for contempt . 
if you want to deal with Senator Thompson on the issue of contempt , do so . 
however , let us be governed by our own rules . 
let us follow the Parliament of Canada Act , which states very clearly that when a senator is absent - that is , he is not in the chamber or is not wherever someone might think he should be , as we think Senator Thompson should have been here yesterday - if he has a valid medical certificate , he is considered to be in attendance . 
that is the law . 
i am not making it up . 
it was pointed out to us last night by the Law Clerk and Parliamentary Counsel , Mr. Mark Audcent . 
we should be very careful when issuing press releases and so on , and expelling Senator Thompson for something of which he is not guilty . 
hon. Marcel Prud ' homme : 
your Honour , earlier , you said that Senator Ghitter had exhausted the time allotted for his speech on this debate , and you asked if there was consent for a question . 
there was then some side discussion . 
i only have one question for Senator Ghitter on his speech . 
i thought that we had consent from the Senate to do so . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , I was under the impression that the Honourable Senator Lucier was rising to ask a question . 
it turned out that he wanted to make a speech , which would normally mean that further questions have been precluded . 
however , I admit that the Senate had agreed to questioning . 
if it is agreed , I will hear the question . 
is it agreed ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
senator Prud ' homme : 
honourable senators , if I heard Senator Ghitter properly , he said that there are precedents in the House of Commons . 
could he kindly repeat that ? 
the only precedent that I hope would not be thrown into this debate is the manner in which the Louis Riel matter was handled and the reasons for that . 
could the honourable senator give me other examples so that I may reflect further on this point ? 
i do not want to start a debate on Louis Riel today . 
i am not in good shape to do that but I am more than ready to do so , should the occasion arise . 
hon. Ron Ghitter : 
i am not equating Louis Riel with Senator Thompson or the facts . 
it is the legal precedent of the basis of the expulsion . 
there have been other cases . 
Beauchesne also quotes from the case of Fred Rose in 1946 . 
again , that one is somewhat different in fact . 
the House of Commons has the right to expel . 
Beauchesne ' s says , without a doubt , that the House has the right to expel a member for such reasons as it deems fit . 
Billy MacLean is another case , where the legislature in Nova Scotia expelled a member . 
clearly , it is the right of a legislative chamber to do so on grounds it deems fit . 
i am not comparing this situation to Louis Riel or to Fred Rose , but the right is there . 
i hope I have answered the question satisfactorily . 
hon. Jerahmiel S . Grafstein : 
honourable senators , this is an important question for all of us . 
therefore , we should deal with it in transparent fairness . 
the question that I have for the Honourable Senator Ghitter is this : 
Beauchesne ' s , Sixth Edition , page 17 , states : 
in any case where the propriety of a Member ' s action is brought into question , a specific charge must be made . 
the Speaker will not allow the Standing Committee on Elections , Privileges and Procedure to examine the actions and statements of a Member relating to the question to report generally on the matter . 
as a precondition , there must be process and a specific allegation . 
second - and I have not looked at this completely - the British North America Act , section 31 , states that the Place of a Senator shall become vacant for not appearing for two consecutive sessions , for aligning with a foreign power or for being adjudged bankrupt or insolvent . 
the pertinent one is found at paragraph ( 4 ) , which states : 
if he is attainted of Treason or convicted of Felony or of any infamous crime : 
i think we are caught here . 
i understand the feelings of all senators . 
we are caught between trying to do the appropriate thing and the right thing . 
that is my question . 
senator Ghitter : 
honourable senators , on the reference relative to the ways senators automatically lose their seats , section 31 states : 
the Place of a Senator shall become vacant in any of the following Cases : 
if any of those cases occur , the seat becomes vacant . 
i am told by counsel - and I discussed this section this morning - that there may be an argument to the effect that that section is exhaustive and there are no other grounds . 
however , the better opinion of that section relates to the section that I quoted , which deals in terms of the privileges , immunities and powers held and enjoyed by this chamber and the House of Commons as passed on from the British Parliament . 
we have all those powers . 
if Parliament wants the legislation to be more specific , " A senator ' s seat becomes vacant in the event of , " they have that power . 
however , our powers are broader than that . 
that is the argument . 
if I am wrong , then I invite Senator Thompson to deal with the matter through the courts . 
i cannot specifically say that I am right . 
i will only say that the better opinion that I have received is that we have the power . 
senator Grafstein : 
the honourable senator has answered the second part of my question , but the first part concerns the question of the specific charge . 
assuming that his conduct is egregious , there is still a question of due process and giving a senator an opportunity to respond to a specific charge . 
i do not want to prejudice my vote on this matter , but I do not think the world will come to an end if we give Senator Thompson a specific charge and a specific time to respond to that charge . 
i assume that the committee has done that . 
they have given him a short period of time to respond . 
having done that , as far as I am concerned , we have not done the right thing for the wrong reason . 
we want to do the right thing for the right reason . 
deal with the process question for me now . 
senator Ghitter : 
the process question can be established by this chamber in any manner it wishes . 
if this chamber determines that it wants to give notice and it wants to go through a process , then this chamber can do so . 
if Senator Grafstein wishes to be more gracious and sympathetic to this gentleman , he can say , " I want to give him notice again . " 
however , Senator Thompson has already thumbed his nose at us . 
he has already received the order of this place to appear . 
i was here yesterday . 
i do not know where his seat is , but he was not there . 
that is enough for me . 
others may have a different view , but the chamber can do as it wishes in that regard . 
hon. P . Derek Lewis : 
honourable senators , I notice in the honourable senator ' s amendment he suggests that Senator Thompson be expelled . 
what do you mean by " expelled " ? 
do you equate that with vacating his seat ? 
you may have answered that question a few minutes ago , but there may be quite a difference in the interpretation of that word . 
senator Ghitter : 
i use the term " expelled " based on what I have read of the authorities , limited as they are . 
it means that you are gone . 
you are out . 
that is fine . 
i think Mr. MacLean ran again in Nova Scotia . Nevertheless , in this place , " expelled " means that you are gone . 
the Prime Minister can reappoint him if he chooses to , but by that time he would be 75 . 
senator Lewis : 
what you are saying is that the seat be vacated ? 
senator Ghitter : 
Yes. 
senator Lewis : 
there might be some legal implications there . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , does that exhaust the questions ? 
are we ready to proceed with the debate ? 
senator Grafstein : 
i am sorry to belabour this point , but it is important . 
i cannot equate the power of this chamber to expel with the law of the Constitution which says " vacate . " 
there is no difference in my mind between " expulsion " and " vacation . " 
that appears to be the remedy that the honourable senator is suggesting for this chamber . 
essentially , he is saying that this chamber should decide what the definition of vacation is . 
i think there is an alternative that reaches the same result , but that is for another time and another place . 
i am not sure from reading this statute , namely the British North America Act , 1867 , whether we have the power to expel when the statute says that we can only vacate under certain preconditions . 
are we taking the Constitution into our hands ? 
i think the Constitution is above us . 
this chamber has to do its work under the Constitution . 
i am not here to defend Senator Thompson . 
he is an old friend of mine , but I am not here to defend his egregious conduct . 
in my heart and in my mind , I want us in this chamber to do , and to appear to do , the right thing . 
i am not sure that this is the right thing . 
hon. Philippe Deane Gigant � s : 
is Senator Ghitter basing himself on that section of the state papers of 1867 which say that the rules of the House of Commons in Britain should apply to the Canadian House of Commons and the Canadian Senate ; and , further , on descriptions of those powers in Britain , which are also our powers , which say that we shall make our own rules on how to discipline people , and for what reasons ? 
senator Ghitter : 
Yes. 
i read section 18 of the act . 
that is what I understood it to say , and I have been advised that that is what it says . 
hon. Sharon Carstairs ( Deputy Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , I do not think that in this chamber there is a great deal of sympathy for , or empathy with , Andrew Thompson . 
i think Senator Thompson has , in many ways , reflected the things which Senator Ghitter has expressed so eloquently this afternoon . 
it did not give me any comfort when I read my morning paper to learn of interviews with Senator Thompson , or visits by reporters to Senator Thompson in La Paz , Mexico . 
there is no reason for any of us in this chamber to feel diminished . 
there is , however , a reason for us to feel diminished if we do not act with respect to our own rules . 
we passed an order in this chamber on December 16 . 
we informed Senator Thompson , by an order which was followed by a letter , that we wanted him to appear , and that if he did not appear the Standing Committee on Privileges , Standing Rules and Orders would deal with the issue of whether he should or should not be held in contempt of this chamber . 
the Rules Committee met last evening for a considerable length of time . 
i understand that 18 of our members attended that meeting . 
i also understand that they formulated a unanimous report . 
that unanimous report says that we want to ensure that due process is respected ; we want to order Senator Thompson to appear before us next Wednesdays evening ; we want to put to him questions on whether he should or should not be held in contempt . 
the committee , in its wisdom - or perhaps lack of wisdom - made a decision . 
i respect that decision . 
i was not present at that committee meeting . 
i did not participate in the debate . 
i therefore must conclude that they did the very best job that they could do in coming to the conclusion that they did . 
having come to that conclusion , they have asked this chamber to pass a resolution on an order , an order which I will support because of my respect for this chamber , and because it is not Andy Thompson who diminishes me ; it would be the work of the entire chamber and , as I respect the committee , I respect the chamber . 
hon. Terry Stratton : 
honourable senators , I am not a lawyer , and I do not pretend to be . 
i do not think that what we are debating here is unimportant . 
it is critically important . 
i appreciate the position that the committee took with regard to this issue . 
however , the fact is that the Canadian public is absolutely disgusted with how this man is treating the Canadian people , aside from his treatment of this place . 
he is thumbing his nose at them , in essence . 
he is saying , " You can ' t catch me . " 
Canadians are fed up to the eyeballs with this kind of behaviour . 
he demeans not only this place but Parliament as a whole , and the country as a whole . 
we all know that he has a medical certificate . 
get it done . 
let him come after us . 
let him sue and say that we do not have the right to do this . " 
that is what Canadians want , and that is what we should put on record . 
let him come to us . 
why should we be polite and go to him when he has treated this place , and this country , with utter and total contempt ? 
let us put the onus on him to come back to us and defend his position , that he deserves to get paid for being absent for this length of time . 
that is absolute and total nonsense , as you know . 
we have discussed the appropriate thing and the right thing . 
i believe that I have spelled out to you the right and appropriate thing to do today . 
if by next Wednesday he does not appear , what will you do then ? 
will we have another debate like this ? 
get it done now . 
senator Gigant � s : 
honourable senators , I am terribly anxious to get Andy Thompson out of here . 
i feel the way you do . 
however , let us suppose that he turns up , or that he does not turn up , and we find out that he really is ill . 
is it not worth one more week to give him the chance to come and explain himself before us ? 
i would prefer to throw him out today . 
senator Stratton : 
you need only look down the way to Senator Gauthier . 
look at what he is going through in order to come here . 
senator Gigant � s : 
of course . 
jean - Robert Gauthier is an example to all of us . 
he is a particularly fine senator and he was a particularly fine MP and we are proud of him . 
not one of us in here is proud of Andy Thompson , but we are proud of the Senate . 
senator Carstairs was right - I must say that against all my gut instincts - when she said we must respect the procedures and rules of our institution . 
the rules of the British House of Commons say we can determine what to do with a member whom we want to discipline . 
we can determine his offence and what punishment we shall mete out for that offence ; that is clear . 
we cannot do that leaving some ambiguity . 
some members in the committee pointed out that we did not specify which day in February . 
i know it is splitting hairs , but those people who were splitting those hairs are good lawyers and they know what they are saying from the legal point of view . 
do we want to set a bad example regarding the respect for the other rules we have . 
there is a rule that says that if you declare you are sick you must produce a medical certificate . 
he has produced medical certificates from many doctors . 
i can fool any doctor and convince the doctor that I am suffering from everything if I so choose . 
i can walk in like a poor little old 75 - year - old senator , trembling a little on my feet , and say that I have back aches , which cannot be disputed . 
it is our rule that he must send medical certificates . 
he has sent them . 
we have some doubts and we say , come and explain yourself . 
we have said that once , but we said it without specifying a date . 
the lawyers on the committee , who are as anxious as the honourable senator to throw him out , said it was not a specific date . 
much as it hurts me , much as it twists my stomach and makes me want to vomit , I am afraid I will vote the way my deputy leader says I should . 
hon. J . Michael Forrestall : 
the senator raises an interesting point . 
we have , as now suggested , set a date certain that can be communicated to our colleague . 
what position is this chamber in should a lawyer or someone on his behalf produce a certificate saying he is not able to attend this chamber , nor his agents or his representatives , for a period of six months or two years ? 
what happens then ? 
senator Lewis : 
that will be for the Senate to decide . 
senator Gigant � s : 
what happens then ? 
what happens if we throw him out today and he comes tomorrow with that particular certificate ? 
whether today or a week from now , we must take that decision . 
if we take it in a week , after having given him notice to appear by a specific date and at a specific time , at least we will have set aside the possibility of being told we did not give him fair warning . 
that is all . 
hon. A . Raynell Andreychuk : 
i have a question for Senator Gigant � s . 
i am having the same problem of trying to come to the right conclusion here . 
you have pointed out the rights of Senator Thompson . 
you have said that we should do the right thing . 
perhaps the honourable senator should look at it as I am beginning to look at it , as Senator Thompson ' s responsibility . 
he has a responsibility to be here . 
hon. Senators : 
hear , hear ! 
senator Andreychuk : 
he has a responsibility to know what is going on here . 
he has a responsibility to do his duties correctly . 
he got a notice . 
he had a responsibility to come here . 
we have a responsibility to the people of Canada . 
do I weigh Senator Thompson ' s rights as more important than bringing this house , the justice system and the whole parliamentary system into disrepute , because that is what I am doing if I bend to the rights of Senator Thompson ? 
senator Gigant � s : 
senator Andreychuk and I are on the same side . 
you talk about not bringing the system under disrepute . 
that is what worries me ; this little lingering fear that if we do it today rather than a week from now , some lawyers may turn up and argue in law journals that we did not follow the procedure to the letter . 
it has no implications for me , I retire soon , but it is too serious a matter for us to disregard . 
senator Andreychuk : 
do you not agree that we should worry about the broad principles for which we are responsible . 
if we err , if we do anything wrong to Senator Thompson , he can come here and we can , as a body , take that into account and reverse ourselves . 
we have given the benefit of the doubt to Senator Thompson for too many years . 
perhaps we should give now some credence to the entire principles of this institution and to the whole concept of justice . 
senator Gigant � s : 
senator Andreychuk , on the last point you raise , if we voted him out today for contempt , his seat would be vacant . 
he does not want him anywhere near . 
if the Prime Minister could send him to Antipodes he would do so , in a coffin . 
honourable senators , I was at the Rules Committee meeting last night . 
i must say that I opposed coming to the Senate today with the text of the letter that we are sending to Senator Thompson . 
i opposed it because of what I thought would happen , and it has happened . 
i have been spending some time explaining to some of my French - speaking colleagues the definition of a Mexican stand - off . 
i thought , first , that it was unnecessary , and second , that we would end up in a Mexican stand - off . 
i think most of us have the same goal , which is to deal with the problem of Senator Thompson . 
i do not think that at the meeting of the committee last night there was any disagreement that we should deal with the Thompson problem . 
that is not the issue . 
the issue is that he has not shown up for years , he has abused the system , and that situation must be dealt with . 
i understood that the motion that the Senate passed , to which he did not conform , put him in contempt . 
i am not a lawyer , but I have been in Parliament for 25 or 26 years , and I know that Parliament generally makes its own rules . 
we are a court . 
i understand that there is a difference , but I also understand the concept of natural justice . 
it seemed to me at the committee meeting last night that we were in the process of dealing with this issue in a fairly effective way , and I think most of us from both sides agreed . 
we did not have an argument . 
we would give Senator Thompson an opportunity to answer soon . 
we know that we are dealing with some place in Mexico . 
we could certainly send the notice to wherever his address is in Ontario ; we all understand that . 
however , in the spirit of natural justice , we decided that we would allow time enough for a message to be sent to him , requesting his presence at our committee to explain himself - I think we were intending to deal with this on Tuesday of next week , and it became Wednesday . 
this was done in the spirit of natural justice . 
i do not believe that anyone at the meeting last night had the idea that we would come in here today to this chamber and expel him . 
it is not a question of our being sued . 
we will not be sued . 
you cannot sue Parliament . 
what are you talking about ? 
the plain fact of the matter is that the man has certain rights . 
i believe it was generally understood by the committee last evening that those rights included having a message delivered from the committee , a request to appear before that committee . 
somehow - and certainly against my wishes - that turned into another appeal to the chamber as a whole to approve this letter . 
that has taken place , and I certainly would argue that we should approve the letter now that we have gone this far . 
if he does not obey that letter , I suppose that would be another contempt of the Senate . 
that has led into what I thought it would lead us into : a Mexican stand - off . 
some people here are friends of Senator Thompson , so naturally they might be defensive about this action . 
that is reasonable . 
that is natural . 
we must accept human nature . 
in any event , we brought the matter here , and time has gone by on something that , in my opinion , should not have been here in the first place , because we do not have to command him to come . 
we could have just requested him to come . 
on the excessively legalistic issue of what we do next , I know that he has not actually broken any rules . 
he has supplied a medical certificate . 
we have been into all of this background . 
there is a history to this situation . 
this is not something that has just arrived here today , or in the recent past . 
senator Thompson is entitled to a full pension . 
if he cannot attend , he should take his pension , in my opinion . 
i hope this letter goes out following this unnecessary procedure , which has led us into this debate that we did not need to have . 
we can send the letter . 
if he attends , that is another story , but if he does not attend , then I certainly would support the concept that , for this session , he does not get paid . 
i think that is reasonable . 
he can decide that he does not want to get paid for the next year or two - sessions now can last much longer than they used to - or he can take his pension . 
that seems to me to be a very reasonable resolution to the problem . 
in my opinion , we should not spend any more time here this afternoon firing away at each other , trying to be holier than holy , trying to make extra hay out of a very bad situation that we would all like to see cleared up because , of course , it reflects on us all . 
none of us like the situation . 
most of us are hard - working parliamentarians . 
we do not go in for this kind of thing . 
let us just get on with it , deal with it , get him to stay in Mexico with his pension , and end this problem . 
hon. Pierre Claude Nolin : 
honourable senators , a number of distinctions need to be made to help clarify the debate . 
first , in December , when this house unanimously approved the order to show up at the next sitting of the Senate at the resumption of the session , there was no need to specify a date . 
i heard someone say a moment ago - I think it was Senator Gigant � s - that the date was uncertain . 
i am sorry but the date was certain . 
senator Gigant � s : 
senator Nolin : 
it was a definite date : the day this House resumed sitting . 
that is not a valid argument . 
we do not give orders very often . 
very seldom in fact . 
he had every latitude to act after December 16 , the day this order was issued or , to be more precise , the day he was served with it . 
legalities aside , I am sure Senator Thompson reads Canadian newspapers every morning . 
by the morning of December 17 , he knew that he had been ordered to take his seat in this house when it reconvened . 
he chose to do none of this . 
last night , we found out he had contacted the Office of the Clerk to tell them he might be back in February . 
that ' s it ! 
he is therefore in contempt . 
nothing else matters . 
medical certificates no longer matter . 
all this stuff does not mean anything any more . 
yesterday , we heard the two experts who told us that he was in contempt . 
it is very simple . 
for example , when a court order is issued , if the person does not show up to testify , that person is automatically held in contempt . 
the judge then has the power to impose a penalty . 
today , we are dealing with a similar situation . 
we have various options , including a forced departure under section 18 . 
do not confuse it with other sections of the Constitution dealing with forced departures . 
i am referring to a section of the Constitution that gives us privileges which existed in the British House of Commons in 1867 . 
natural justice had until yesterday , at 2 p.m. , to prevail . 
senator Thompson did not show up , and he was fully aware of the circumstances . 
do not come and tell me that a senator who has been here for 31 years does not know when the Senate reconvenes , or how to find out the precise date when we resume sitting . 
he was instructed to be here at 2 p . m , yesterday . 
he did not come . 
he is in contempt of this institution . 
now , will we have the courage to go through with our decisions ? 
when we decided to issue an order to Senator Thompson , we knew that if he did not comply , we would have to find him guilty of contempt . 
it is up to us to do so , and we will do it today . 
senator Grafstein : 
honourable senators , again I find myself in the same difficult position as every senator does here . 
it is very difficult for any senator to defend Senator Thompson ' s conduct in the absence of a clear explanation . 
it is almost impossible to do so . 
if it were one session or two sessions , that might be understandable , but a lengthy , systemic absence is tantamount to abrogating his responsibilities . 
i think that was the point that the Honourable Senator Andreychuk was attempting to make . 
perhaps the Honourable Senator Ghitter was attempting to make the same point in his argument , although not in his conclusion , that systemically we have a failure to exercise responsibility . 
perhaps one session , two sessions or three sessions are all understandable because of illness , but if it goes on for a long period of time , where do we draw the line ? 
on the facts , the conclusion seems to be almost inexorable . 
i say " almost inexorable " because we have yet to hear from Senator Thompson . 
having said that , Senator Ghitter ' s proposition is very appealing . 
let ' s get it over ; let ' s get it done ; let ' s satisfy this outrage in the public and the outrage in the media . 
i would love to do that . 
why not ? 
then we can get on with our business ; we can clear our clogged veins . 
unfortunately , honourable senators , it is not as easy as that . 
what happens to Ontario ? 
do we have one seat less ? 
many people in the media , many people in the west , and many people outside of this chamber would love to see this chamber destroyed . 
they would love to pick away at it . 
i disagree with that , but I hear it . 
i have concluded that we cannot carry out this action unless we can conform with the British North America Act . 
the Prime Minister said the other day that he would like to kick Senator Thompson out , but cannot . 
he would like his colleagues on this side of the Senate to kick him out , but we do not believe we can do so without due process - and then there are questions . 
i say to Senator Beaudoin , a man whose entire life is built on the rule of law , and I say to Senator Jessiman , a great lawyer , and I say to senators on the other side who are respectable and honourable people as well as senators , let us think about this situation , not only to satisfy ourselves , not only to satisfy the public , but to satisfy the rule of law . 
i do not believe at this moment , unless I hear a compelling reason from the other side , that we can support this most appealing , most attractive and most spontaneous solution to the demands of our innermost conscience . 
my conscience says , yes , let us follow the committee ' s advice . 
senator Thompson should do the right and honourable thing by either appearing or offering an explanation . 
i think the onus to explain is upon him beyond a reasonable doubt . 
that should satisfy the conscience of the members of this chamber , and it should satisfy the Constitution . 
honourable senators , I believe in the Constitution , and I want to live under it . 
i do not want this chamber to be criticized for abusing the Constitution . 
i have argued and agreed with Senator Beaudoin , time and time again , that this Senate is responsible for upholding the Constitution . 
having said that , how can we fly in the face of it and then impose a standard on others outside of this chamber ? 
senator Nolin : 
perhaps the Honourable Senator Grafstein could tell me which section of the Constitution we are breaching ? 
which one ? 
senator Grafstein : 
i refer Senator Nolin to section 31 of the British North America Act , 1867 , which , as amended , is really the Constitution Act of 1982 . 
we are clear on that now ? 
senator Nolin : 
would the honourable senator explain it to us ? 
senator Grafstein : 
section 31 reads as follows : 
( 1 ) If for Two consecutive Sessions of Parliament he fails to give his Attendance to the Senate : 
that is the factual question yet to be determined by the committee . 
on the face of it , prima facie , he has not attended , but there is conflicting evidence about that . 
we have heard that from other senators . 
that is proposition number 1 . 
( 2 ) If he takes an Oath ... to a Foreign Power ... 
that is not the case . 
( 3 ) If he is adjudged Bankrupt or Insolvent ... 
that is not the case . 
( 4 ) If he is attained of Treason or convicted of Felony or of any infamous Crime : 
( 5 ) If he ceases to be qualified in respect of Property or of Residence ... 
those appear to be the provisions under the act . 
as I say , I would like to follow this act . 
senator Nolin : 
what if I told you to read section 18 of the same Constitution ? 
under that specific section , we have been told that the doctrine is very clear . 
as a chamber , we have the power to expel someone . 
that power was there in the U . K . in 1867 , and we have had that power since . 
that is what we were told last night , namely , we have the power to expel . 
forget section 31 . 
it is not in question here . 
section 18 is the basis of our right today . 
senator Grafstein : 
this is an important question . 
i have not had the opportunity of counsel and I have not read the opinions that were available to the committee . 
having said that , when I read section 18 about the privilege and immunities and powers held and enjoyed by the Senate , I thought that the process that we had undertaken here , collectively , was to move towards a remedy that would be consistent with the Charter and our powers . 
the remedy that I thought we were moving towards was the suspension of the senators rights and privileges because he has been held in contempt . 
first , we must make a finding of contempt . 
we then suspend his rights and privileges and then let him decide how he wants to get himself back in good standing or do whatever else he chooses . 
i thought that was the course that the committee was moving towards . 
i am not comfortable with moving to section 31 to vacate or expel , which is tantamount to vacating the seat . 
i think that is a material distinction . 
senator Nolin : 
the honourable senator is a lawyer , and he knows the difference . 
the result is the same ; the process is not . 
you have to agree on that . 
senator Ghitter : 
honourable senators , Senator Grafstein has appropriately pointed to Senator Beaudoin as the guru in this chamber relative to our powers . 
i should like Senator Beaudoin to give us his opinion . 
that is the question . 
motion in Subamendment 
hon. Edward M. Lawson : 
honourable senators , notwithstanding the point that Senator Ghitter has made , sufficient doubt has been raised by the presentation given by Senator Grafstein as it applies to the British North America Act ; and by Senator Lucier , so that no layman or non - lawyer such as myself is prepared to make a decision without His Honour making a ruling on proper legal advice from the Senate lawyers . 
i do not mean legal advice from Senator Beaudoin or others , but from legal counsel for the Senate . 
they should make a decision and report to us about whether or not we have the legal right to proceed to expel , or to cause the seat to be vacated . 
i am asking for that advice now . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , the Speaker cannot become involved in legal decisions . 
i cannot get involved in that matter . 
however , if it is the wish of the Senate , someone can put forward an amendment that we hear from counsel . 
that is for the Senate to decide , not the Speaker . 
senator Lawson : 
therefore , I move : 
that we seek the Senate legal counsel to advise us whether we have the legal right to proceed in the manner being proposed . 
hon. Sharon Carstairs ( Deputy Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , that is exactly what the committee was doing . 
hon. Herbert O . Sparrow : 
honourable senators , I have a question for Senator Ghitter . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , is there a seconder ? 
this is a subamendment . 
we already have a motion in amendment but there is still the possibility of a subamendment , which would be the last . 
please give me the motion in writing . 
we must be very precise . 
hon. Marcel Prud ' homme : 
your Honour , I have a point of order . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
i can hear a point of order on the subamendment , although it is not before us at the moment . 
senator Prud ' homme : 
honourable senators , what I have read for 35 years about the Senate chamber is that order excludes haste and precipitation . 
today , we are faced with a resolution with amendments and subamendments . 
we are even challenging each other , in a very unfair way , to put Senator Beaudoin on the spot by saying , " Here is our guru . 
why do you not get up and tell us what you think . " 
the matter demands reflection . 
i suggest to the Senate that we take 24 hours to reflect and make a decision on the entire matter tomorrow . 
that would be more appropriate for senators . 
i am impressed with what Senator Grafstein and Senator Lewis have said . 
if you have read Mr. Crosbie ' s memories , you will know that he referred to Senator Lewis as a quiet but great legal mind . 
all of that put together makes me believe that 24 hours will not harm anyone . 
i understand the press . 
there is a major preoccupation with this issue , but we must deal with it . 
i wish to take my responsibility now - although it may be unpopular with the press and with public opinion - and move the adjournment of the debate . 
if I am not here tomorrow - that is , if I am not healthy - you may proceed without me . 
i am sure that all senators would like to reflect on this serious matter . 
that is what the Senate is all about . 
i am sure that all Canadians will understand that 24 hours , in an orderly debate , would not be unreasonable to deal with this matter , namely , the absence of Senator Thompson . 
hon. Peter A . Stollery : 
point of order ! 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
a point of order was already raised by the Honourable Senator Prud ' homme . 
however , he has made a suggestion . 
if honourable senators wish to follow that suggestion , the Senate is free to do so . 
senator Stollery : 
i do not quite understand what has happened . 
has the other side withdrawn the unanimous support that it gave last night ? 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , I do not see a valid point of order in the comments of Senator Stollery . 
they may be valid comments in the debate but they are not a point of order insofar as a challenge of the rules . 
the Honourable Senator Lawson has his subamendment ready now . 
we will hear that first . 
senator Lawson : 
honourable senators , I move , seconded by Senator Lucier : 
that the Senate obtain from legal counsel available to the Senate whether the Senate has the legal right to deal with the motion before us to expel Senator Thompson from the Senate . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
that is not a valid subamendment in its present form . 
senator Lawson : 
we will change the form , then ! 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
we would have to amend the amendment by adding " thereto " and then see if it fits . 
senator Lawson : 
with the same seconder , then , I move : 
that the debate on the motion in amendment be adjourned until the Senate Law Clerk has rendered an opinion on its legality ; and 
that the Law Clerk report his opinion to the Senate by tomorrow . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
it is moved by the Honourable Senator Lawson , seconded by the Honourable Senator Lucier : 
that the motion in amendment be amended by adding thereto : 
that the debate on the motion in amendment be adjourned until the Senate Law Clerk has rendered an opinion on its legality ; and 
that the Law Clerk report his opinion to the Senate by tomorrow . 
hon. G � rald - A . 
honourable senators , I have no objection to waiting for twenty - four hours . 
we are dealing here with a fundamental legal problem . 
i have no doubt that a legislative assembly may expel a member . 
this is what we call , in constitutional law , an inherent right . 
however , the jurisprudence is only about the House of Commons in London and the House of Commons in Canada , and some historical cases such as that of Louis Riel . 
to my knowledge , this is the first time that the Senate has had a debate such as this . 
in the British North America Act , there are sections dealing with the vacation of a seat . 
the idea of having an expression of opinion in 24 hours from someone not of this house would be quite acceptable to me , although I think that if we look clearly at the facts of the case before this chamber , we are probably waiting for nothing at all . 
the situation has remained the same for many years . 
if a person is prepared to go to Mexico , why not to Ottawa ? 
in that sense , perhaps we are discussing this matter for nothing . 
however , as a jurist , I would like to have an independent opinion . 
nevertheless , I still think that , in extraordinary cases - and I believe that everyone in Canada agrees that is the case here - a legislative house , within its sphere , has the inherent right to expel a member . 
that is my conclusion . 
i may be wrong , but I am inclined to think that way . 
i should like to look at some precedents in the House of Lords , or some other second chambers in the world . 
in that sense , it might be good to have 24 hours in which to think more about the matter . 
however , for the moment , that is my opinion . 
senator Prud ' homme : 
honourable senators , I sat in the House of Commons for 30 years . 
we have expelled members from the House of Commons , but we have not vacated their seats . 
we must be very precise . 
senator Lewis , strongly supported by the Honourable Senator Grafstein , drew our attention to the fact that " expel " and " vacate " may mean different things . 
before we vote , we will need to read the motion very carefully . 
" expel " could mean " expelling " or it could mean " no pay , " which may be a good proposal . 
senator Thompson could not receive his pension because he has not resigned , but also he could not be paid because he does not show up . 
that is a decision which has previously been made for staff . 
we would be punishing him by saying that he is a nobody . 
if he wants to receive money , he will need to resign and then he will get his pension . 
i have a question for Senator Beaudoin . 
honourable senators , there is not a lot of difference between " expel " and the term used by Senator Lewis , with his very precise legal mind , " vacate . " 
haste and precipitancy may be useful for public opinion , but we are supposed to be very serious people , and I think we are . 
the action that we take should be that upon which we all agree . 
there are many other alternatives . 
the press has reason to say that the man never shows up and therefore does not deserve to be paid . 
we started to punish him . 
perhaps we did not punish him well enough , and should go all the way . 
perhaps we should say that if he does not show up there will be no pay , for the indicated reasons . 
or we could say that if wants to receive money , he need only resign in order to receive his pension . 
i believe that this debate needs to be conducted in an orderly manner . 
haste , in this case , is not leading to good order . 
we are not answering to the mob . 
we want to do what is best in the interests of Canada , and surely 24 hours of reflection will hurt no one . 
we may come up with a clearer solution . 
hon. No � l A . Kinsella ( Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , if the subamendment were to be adopted , I would hope that senators would agree that we resolve ourselves into a Committee of the Whole and have the Law Clerk appear before us in order that we might have an opportunity for exchange with legal counsel . 
as they say in the House of Lords , if there is content for the subamendment , I would ask my colleague opposite whether she would agree that we would receive that opinion in Committee of the Whole . 
if we cannot have agreement and a motion is necessary , I would seek the opportunity to move such a motion . 
senator Lawson : 
the 24 hours is not cast in stone . 
i have no problem with changing that aspect . 
hon. Michel Cogger : 
senator Beaudoin , I have listened to your speech and I have more questions . 
lacking a clear distinction between the power to expel and to declare vacant , do we not run the risk of ending up in a situation where the power of the Prime Minister to be the only one to select and appoint senators would be frustrated ? 
what would there be to prevent such a thing ? 
is there not an inherent contradiction in this motion , which would , when it came down to it , mean that we would have the right , by majority vote , to declare a vacancy ? 
i am no longer referring to expulsion for various lengths of time . 
senator Beaudoin : 
obviously , if there is a by - election - I think this was what happened in Nova Scotia - the individual who was expelled ran again . 
if memory serves , he was re - elected . 
so that sorted out the problem . 
senators are not elected , and appointments are made by the Governor General on the advice of the Prime Minister . 
once a senator is expelled , does the seat necessarily become vacant ? 
i would like to hear an opinion on this as well . 
but if it is not challenged , and the Prime Minister appoints a replacement , that solves the problem . 
but obviously it can be challenged later . 
i will not take this any further . 
obviously , this will set a precedent and cause an uproar . 
if I were asked if a legislative chamber may take this action , I am inclined to think it has the inherent right to do so . 
however , the opposite argument is that the Constitution already has sections 18 and 31 , which set out the privileges enjoyed by the Senate and contain provisions regarding Senate vacancies . 
is this exhaustive ? 
does this prevent the exercise of an inherent right ? 
i will not take it further for now . 
hon. Philippe Deane Gigant � s : 
if there is no appeal , the Prime Minister could appoint someone else . 
appeal where ? 
before what court ? 
that is the first question . 
the courts traditionally do not meddle in the internal affairs of Parliament . 
second , is Senator Beaudouin aware of the fact that we had two legal opinions yesterday at the meeting of the Committee on Privileges , Standing Rules and Orders to the effect that we can expel a senator . 
the Senate ' s legal advisor said that historical documents from 1867 indicate the rules of the British House of Commons apply to the Canadian House of Commons and Senate . 
senator Beaudoin : 
on the first point , it is true that the courts do not meddle in the legislative process . 
however , the courts have the right to give an opinion on the application of the Constitution . 
in this regard , if Senator Thompson says no , the Senate ' s action is ultra vires , he can of course appeal to the courts . 
the court would decide . 
if he does not , and the seat is filled , the matter is resolved . 
that is all I am saying . 
senator Gigant � s : 
whether we decide today or next week , what we are saying at the moment is relevant , and I hope that we will not have to debate it again next week . 
if the senator appeals our decision , the court will be obliged to find that the action taken by this chamber to discipline one of its members was not correct . 
British law that applies to the British House of Commons and to the Canadian House of Commons and Senate makes no provision for intervention by the courts with respect to a legislative chamber that says : " You have not done your job well . " 
i am not talking about the interpretation of a section of the Constitution on the reasons for expelling a senator . 
i am speaking of the inherent right you refer to . 
and with this inherent right , would the courts dare intervene ? 
senator Beaudoin : 
according to Canada ' s Constitution , a Canadian court has the right to decide whether a legislative assembly has the inherent right to expel a member . 
it will not express an opinion in a specific instance , but it will on the right of the legislative chamber to expel a member . 
the Fathers of Confederation provided a special system for the Senate that differs from that of the House of Commons . 
house of Commons precedents may apply here but only so long as they are consistent with the Constitution of the Senate . 
i think that , in a truly extraordinary case , the right to expel is inherent . 
now , should we exercise that right ? 
that is another matter . 
do the lawyers agree that the right is inherent ? 
if they said so yesterday , that confirms what I am saying today . 
hon. Jerahmiel S . Grafstein : 
i have a question for Senator Beaudoin . 
as always , he makes a compelling analysis of a situation which forces us to again think through our original proposition . 
i have looked briefly at an opinion which was available to the committee last night . 
i was not at the committee , but one of my colleagues gave me an opportunity to look at Dawson ' s view on this . 
i hope I am not taking his view out of context , but Dawson essentially says that we are pretty well stuck to section 31 . 
there are many things we can do , but we do not have the same powers as the other place , for good and appropriate constitutional reasons . 
while we can compare ourselves to the House of Lords in England , I think it is more appropriate to compare ourselves to the situation here in Canada . 
i do not think we have the same inherent powers or remedies . 
i am intrigued by Senator Beaudoin ' s inherent rights notion , but Dawson , who is a compelling authority , as far as I am concerned , makes no reference to this . 
he wrestles with this problem , as other senators at other times have wrestled with this issue , and all have come to the conclusion that they were caught by the Constitution and those provisions . 
the nice question that arose from that discussion dealt with the definition of infamous crime . 
is it systematic abrogation of responsibilities for a senator to not attend ? 
it is a nice question . 
i leave it for other finer minds to chew over in the foreseeable future . 
for me , the course of conduct made available to us by the committee , which , I am delighted to say , was unanimous , is a safe course of conduct for all of us . 
senator Beaudoin : 
i am impressed by the opposite argument that there is no such thing as an inherent right . 
however , the fact remains that the Constitution refers to many rights which the Senate has . 
we have the same rights as the House of Commons except the vote of non - confidence , money bills , and the Constitutional amendment , on which we have only a six - month veto . 
otherwise , we have the same powers . 
we are a legislative house , as is the House of Commons . 
history shows that the House of Commons has expelled people . 
i am inclined to think that we also have such a right . 
i respect an opinion to the contrary , of course , because it is a difficult point . 
it is interesting , mind you , but it is difficult . 
senator Carstairs : 
honourable senators , I wish to address the subamendment proposed by Senator Lawson and seconded by Senator Lucier . 
this subamendment presupposes to some degree the work that the committee was going to do . 
it is my understanding that the report presented by the Rules Committee today demands the appearance of Senator Thompson . 
they wanted an order of this house to have him appear . 
if he chose to appear , he would give reasons why he should not be held in contempt . 
if they decided , with or without his appearance , he was in contempt , they would then debate the particular penalties that would apply ; whether it would be expulsion or whether it would be suspension for the remainder of the session of this Parliament , which would more or less coincide with his retirement because he will have reached the age of 75 , thereby giving him the option to retire early if he chose to do so . 
the committee heard last night from the clerk . 
they also heard from other constitutional opinions . 
it was on that basis they prepared the report for today . 
they want to deal further with constitutional opinion on penalties . 
therefore , it would appear to me that the most appropriate thing for us today would be to not support this amendment , as much as we may wish at some time in the future to sit in Committee of the Whole and hear the Law Clerk , after the committee has made a recommendation on penalty . 
now is not the appropriate time to do it . 
we should send the order today to demand that Senator Thompson appear , allow the committee to sit , allow them to deliberate on penalty , and allow them to bring those deliberations to the chamber . 
then we can have a debate in this chamber as to the appropriate votes we should be taking , including deliberations in Committee of the Whole , if that is the will of this chamber at that point in time . 
some Hon. Senators : 
question ! 
hon. P . Michael Pitfield : 
honourable senators , I wish I could speak with the natural dignity and the eloquence of so many of our colleagues . 
let me simply put a few thoughts . 
one of the main purposes of this house is to do justice , to protect against tyranny ; the tyranny , amongst other things , of the majority . 
this is a chamber of sober , second thought . 
we are concerned with protecting the citizen as an individual , and we also are very concerned to protect the individual senator , to protect one another , so that we can be sure that each is bringing his or her best judgment to the questions before us . 
i wish to speak for a moment simply of the procedure that we are following . 
i make no remarks with regard to the particular case . 
it seems to me that we are engaged in a rush to judgment . 
i get nervous when I hear some of our colleagues saying , " We have the power . " 
there is no doubt that we have the power , but we must use it very responsibly , all the more so . 
i have heard , " We must do it now . " 
there have been some very serious doubts raised in this matter . 
we have heard doubts of facts that have been raised by Senator Lawson . 
we have heard doubts of equity that have been raised by Senator Grafstein . 
we have heard doubts about the conflict of the supreme constitutional law with the parliamentary practices of the house . 
honourable senators , I suspect that we are acting as the sharpest and strongest amongst our critics would wish us to act . 
we are giving and we are asking for off - the - cuff legal opinions . 
i urge that we proceed calmly , deliberately , fairly . 
i assure you that if we do not , this matter will be in the courts for years . 
there is the substance here for problems and questions that will keep lawyers writing articles for time immemorial . 
let us not fulfill the worries of Senator Stollery about a Mexican stand - off ; dragging this thing out , spreading the uncertainty , making ourselves a laughing - stock of the country , Canada ' s response to President Clinton . 
we wish to deal with this matter . 
we must deal with this matter , but let us do it in a manner that stands as an example of how legislators should proceed , not as a standard to be referred to in the future of how things should not have been done . 
it is coming to the close of a long afternoon . 
i wonder - it may not be possible - if sometime during the evening , our leaders could have a word with one another to consider how this house , with its manifold and sensible concerns , can draw together and deal with this question in the deliberate manner in the morrow . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
does any other honourable senator wish to speak ? 
hon. Lowell Murray : 
honourable senators , I presume nobody will take up the suggestion that Senator Pitfield has just made and try to move the adjournment of the debate ? 
i see no takers . 
then , honourable senators , if this is going to come to a vote , I think I had better explain myself , not least to my friends and colleagues on this side of the house . 
before I do that , I note that it is 3:40 and we are still at Presentation of Reports from Standing or Special Committees , and that we may be heading for a recorded vote . 
that being the case , in my capacity as chairman of the Standing Senate Committee on Social Affairs , Science and Technology , I want to advise colleagues that I am taking it upon myself to postpone until next week the meeting scheduled for this afternoon . 
i apologize in particular to Senator Haidasz whose Bill S - 8 would have been considered this afternoon with him as principal witness . 
i trust that colleagues and staff within the sound of my voice will take note that I am taking it upon myself to postpone that committee meeting until next week . 
honourable senators , what we have before us is a report from a standing committee , a report which we are led to believe was passed unanimously by that committee last night . 
when the report was brought in this afternoon by the chairman , she sought leave to debate the report at once . 
i pause for a moment to say that our first mistake today was in granting leave . 
what has transpired since we granted leave only goes to prove the wisdom of the rule that it is a good idea to leave committee reports on the table for 24 hours before attempting to deal with them . 
perhaps we will know better next time . 
however , leave was granted , whereupon our friend Senator Ghitter proposed a motion in amendment - but to do what ? 
to do something that the Senate , in its 130 - year history , has never done , to do something for which our authority is not clear . 
i might , at some point , be willing - quite willing - to vote in favour of the expulsion of Senator Thompson , but , not having heard any of the legal or constitutional opinions adduced to the committee last night , and being , as I am , quite unclear as to our authority in this matter , I would certainly not vote in favour of such a motion this afternoon . 
with regard to part of our friend Senator Lawson ' s amendment , I do not know that I would be ready to vote for it in 24 hours ' time . 
this is an unprecedented step we are taking , and if it is to be taken , then I think we should , as Senator Pitfield has said , proceed deliberately and cautiously . 
we should know fully what it is we are doing and with what authority we are doing it . 
there is potentially another problem here . 
i put this to our friend Senator Ghitter . 
if we are satisfied with the authorities , and satisfied that it is the right thing to do , I am not sure , and if his amendment comes to a vote and is defeated today , we could return in due course and take that step , which is a step we might want to take . 
for all those reasons , and for the reasons of process and constitutionality that have been invoked by other honourable senators in the debate , I could not vote for those amendments to this report . 
i simply say that by way of explanation . 
if the matter is forced to a vote now , I will have to vote against it . 
i think a more desirable course for all of us is the one suggested by Senator Pitfield , that there be an opportunity for some discussion among the leaders to agree , if not on what action we should take ultimately , then at least on what the process is that we should follow , because it is fairly clear to me that there was an agreement at the committee meeting last night as to the process that was to be followed , and the various amendments that have been presented today rather derail the process that was contemplated . 
some Hon. Senators : 
hear , hear ! 
hon. John Lynch - Staunton ( Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , I have a few brief remarks . 
as Senator Murray says , the Senate has not been faced with such an issue in 130 years , so we are navigating uncharted waters , to use a well - worn clich � . 
all of us feel uncomfortable with the situation before us , although I think we are unanimous in the intent that is expressed in Senator Ghitter ' s amendment . 
it is a question not only of how we get there but of how we get there properly and expeditiously . 
we have had the situation with us now for many years . 
all of us have been conscious of the fact that Senator Thompson has not been with us , except on those occasions when the law required . 
when asked , we were told that there was a medical certificate . 
never would I challenge a medical certificate of one of our colleagues . 
however , when a colleague cannot present himself for a decade , we have a right to ask what contribution he is making to this place . 
again , I think we all want to see Senator Thompson leave this chamber , unless he can come to us suddenly and say , " Now I am able to work and finish my two years that are left , actively , as I should . " 
that , however , seems to be highly unlikely . 
as I say , we must do this properly and as legally as the experts can tell us we should do it , although , as far as I know , there are no precedents to this situation . 
i am in agreement with Senator Lawson ' s suggestion that we ask our legal counsel for advice . 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
if we were to expel Senator Thompson from this chamber today , what would be the effect of the expulsion ? 
does he continue to be a senator ? 
we are not clear on that . 
i am not here to defend the rights of one particular senator ; I am here to defend the rights of all senators , each and every one of us . 
last December we set in motion what is commonly called " due process " in respect to the case of Senator Thompson . 
we had the motion of Senator Kenny . 
we had hoped Senator Thompson would show up yesterday . 
that committee met last night and brought in a unanimous report , which was presented today . 
leave was given to consider the report today . 
the report proposed a process . 
if we are not satisfied with the opinions given by legal counsel last night , we can explore the legal issues further in that process . 
what concerns me more than anything is the kind of precedent that we may be setting or that we could be setting here today . 
if we vote to expel Senator Thompson in a day , who would be next and why ? 
i am conscious of the honest concern of every member in the chamber , that we , individually and collectively , want to do the right thing . 
however , we want to make sure that when we proceed we are absolutely right and that we are being fair , not only to Senator Thompson , but to one another . 
senator Stratton : 
what about the Canadian public ? 
senator Graham : 
i heard Senator Nolin ask if we have the courage . 
well , I am wondering if we could better serve the institution and the Canadian public by asking if we have the guts and the courage today to follow due process and wait until next Wednesday , as recommended by the committee . 
the process has been set in motion . 
that is why we have committees . 
the final judgment , however , is made in this place , where it should be made . 
honourable senators , I am quite conscious of the remarks made by Senator Pitfield about fairness . 
people have used the words " diminished " and " demeaned " , and we hear the question " What about the public ? " 
i think that as representatives of the public , we have a responsibility to ensure that this institution , a vital and essential part of Parliament under our present Constitution , takes action , but not simply on a whim or because of what the press is saying as it influences public opinion . 
rather , in our hearts , our minds and our souls , we should use common sense , reason , good judgment and fairness in reaching our conclusions . 
hon. C . William Doody : 
honourable senators , I have two questions of clarification . 
i do not know if I am more scared about the road we are heading down without thinking it through properly , or if I am more disgusted with Senator Thompson ' s conduct . 
it has been a very troubling afternoon . 
i am more inclined , personally , to think favourably of Senator Pitfield ' s recommendation . 
that may not be possible . 
however , I am faced with the 24 - hour subamendment that has been offered to us and one which has been recommend by my leader . 
do we start the Committee of the Whole tomorrow at 4:30 p.m. or 4:25 p.m. , or are we talking in terms of the next sitting of the Senate ? 
it would seem pointless to come in here , go through the process of sitting around until 4:30 , and then start a Committee of the Whole . 
if this must be done , let it be done when we sit . 
second , will we be forced to vote on Senator Ghitter ' s amendment tomorrow when this thing is finished without having heard , perhaps to the satisfaction of everyone , all of the testimony we would like to have heard ? 
i am a little uncomfortable with the idea of a Committee of the Whole . 
we have already referred this matter to a committee of the Senate . 
the committee has reported and given us a unanimous recommendation . 
having gone that far , the recommendation I have received from our leadership is that we go along with Senator Lawson ' s recommendation of a 24 - hour response . 
can we tidy that up as to whether it is really a 24 - hour period or is it the next sitting ? 
how will we proceed tomorrow ? 
will we be required to vote on Senator Ghitter ' s motion tomorrow , even if we are satisfied that we have heard the testimony and before we have had a chance to read the committee report ? 
could someone help me with some of these problems ? 
senator Graham : 
perhaps I can make a point by asking Senator Doody a question . 
would he not agree that according to the house order that was passed - Senator Kenny ' s motion in December - we still have two weeks in which to act on the particular motion and matter before us today ? 
senator Stollery : 
honourable senators , the committee was very conscious last night of the fact that we have to comply with the order of December within 14 days . 
that includes the problem of making sure that Senator Thompson receives the communication and that it is done in a reasonable manner . 
i would caution our colleagues against letting too much time go by because it would infringe on the concern addressed by the committee , that there are only 14 days in which to complete this process . 
it is very important to remember that . 
some senators could have said that we should have done this on Friday and that Senator Thompson be asked to appear on Friday . 
the consensus was that it should be Wednesday because of the possible difficulties of Senator Thompson receiving the communication . 
i repeat that all of these things were done unanimously . 
senator Doody : 
honourable senators , I am obviously completely adrift . 
i asked two questions of the leadership relative to the procedure in dealing with this thing . 
he , in turn , asked me a question concerning what I thought about Senator Kenny ' s motion , which is not in my area of interest at this particular time . 
i am interested in whether 24 hours means 4:30 tomorrow afternoon , and whether we will be required to vote on the subamendment and perhaps on the motion tomorrow . 
we may or may not have enough information tomorrow to satisfy us to follow that course . 
maybe I am remiss . 
maybe the report from the committee was delivered to me earlier today . 
i have not seen it . 
i certainly have not had a chance to read it , nor have I had time to look at what they have decided . 
with these uncertainties in mind , I am asking for guidance from the leadership . 
if , somewhere down the road , they want an opinion on what I think of Senator Kenny ' s motion , perhaps I might be prepared to give it then . 
senator Carstairs : 
honourable senators , I will do my best , although I may do it with the clarity of mud . 
what we have before us now is the subamendment of Senator Lawson . 
i have indicated that I cannot support that proposal , because I think this debate should take place in committee before it takes place on the floor of the chamber . 
if , however , Senator Lawson ' s subamendment passes in the chamber , we would then make a decision to hear from legal counsel . 
we would then have to make a decision as to when we would have the Committee of the Whole hear that presentation . 
however , it is essential for us to take the vote on the motion first , and then to set in place the procedure concerning when , exactly , the Committee of the Whole would convene . 
it would be tomorrow afternoon if the matter goes before Committee of the Whole , or we could ask legal counsel by some other means , although I do not know what other means we would use except Committee of the Whole . 
however , we would have to have the approval of Senator Lawson ' s subamendment first . 
senator Lynch - Staunton : 
honourable senators , what we want to know are two things that were raised by - 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , the Honourable Senator Lynch - Staunton has already spoken on this issue . 
is leave granted for the honourable senator to speak again ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
senator Lynch - Staunton : 
as I understand Senator Lawson ' s motion , it is 24 hours , which means " the next sitting . " 
it should be amended to reflect that . 
senator Ghitter ' s amendment to the report has brought up two crucial facts which we must face if we are serious about seeing that Senator Thompson is recognized de facto as no longer a member of this chamber . 
first , what authority does this chamber have to expel him , suspend him , displace him or refuse him entry ? 
that is what we want to know . 
that is what Senator Ghitter ' s intention was , namely , to force the issue here where this final decision will have to be taken . 
if we cannot expel him , can we suspend him ? 
if we cannot suspend him , can we refuse him entry as we refused him his office and the benefits attached to his office ? 
second , can the Senate refuse his salary and his monthly tax - free allowance ? 
that is what we want to know . 
that is what we all hope for - that is , that for non - performance there be non - payment . 
the point is that if we are to take this action - and I agree with all the discussion that has taken place - we should do it the right way . 
the value of Senator Ghitter ' s amendment was to bring the decision to a head in this chamber because a decision must be taken here . 
that is why it is essential that the legal counsel should advise us on those two points . 
hopefully , we can have that legal opinion before us tomorrow and debate it , if need be . 
we did not resume sitting today , we resumed yesterday . 
therefore , he did not honour the order of the Senate . 
why do we want to give him another week ? 
it is important that Senator Ghitter ' s amendment be put under the scrutiny of our expert legal counsel and that , if at all possible , he report to us tomorrow so that we can come to a decision , which I feel is long overdue . 
hon. Richard J . Stanbury : 
honourable senators , I am amazed at what the Leader of the Opposition is suggesting . 
we have a process in the Senate which has been honoured for many , many years , namely , that we refer matters to a committee and the committee is given an opportunity to deal with the matter . 
the committee then reports to the Senate and the Senate deals with that report . 
first , I wish to take issue with the Leader of the Opposition about the order that was made on December 16 . 
the order said , " You are to appear on the resumption of the Senate , " which was yesterday , " and if you do not , the matter will be referred to the Standing Committee on Privileges , Standing Rules and Orders . " 
that is what happened . 
last night , the committee took note that the senator had not turned up and considered what its process should be from there on , so that it could report to the Senate within the two weeks that the Senate had given it to report . 
the purpose of the interim report today is simply to obtain the authority of the Senate to order the appearance to continue to develop this process . 
the committee could have invited him to attend , as Senator Stollery wanted to do last night . 
members - and some of them were Conservative - said , " We do not have authority to invite him . 
we should get the order from the Senate . 
that would give us authority . " 
the whole purpose of the order of the Senate is to begin the process - that is , to give Senator Thompson another opportunity to come here and then to begin the committee discussions , which have to be done quickly because we only have two weeks . 
the committee discussions would involve receiving whatever legal advice we need to be able to come back to the Senate within two weeks and report . 
i perfectly understand Senator Ghitter ' s motion . 
we are all frustrated and want to get it over with . 
however , if we were to pass his amendment , we would simply cut off the opportunity for the committee to do its work , the work which this chamber gave to the committee to do . 
we gave them two weeks in which to do it . 
they are only here this afternoon to ask for authority to get on with the process . 
for goodness sake , let us not mess this thing up any more . 
let us pass the committee report . 
that means an order will go out immediately to Senator Thompson . 
it will be done properly and served properly . 
if he does show up , then we have another situation to deal with but if he does not show up , then the committee must consider what it will report to the Senate . 
within two weeks - which is what the Senate asked for - the Senate will have the opportunity , on the basis of good , solid , evidence and opinion , to make a decision . 
i ask honourable senators to give the committee that opportunity and let us get out of here . 
hon. Terry Stratton : 
honourable senators , I have a question for Senator Stanbury . 
many of us are agonizing over this matter . 
the public will look at the record from 1985 to 1997 going into 1998 , showing the kind of attendance that is recorded . 
the public now sees us , because of a perceived technicality in a committee , trying to ensure that we are fair . 
my concern is simply that we are being seen once again to be dithering . 
what happens if the senator is called by the Senate to appear before the committee and he does not appear ? 
does the committee again seek legal opinion , or does it come back with a concrete recommendation to us for expulsion ? 
having a record since 1985 of non - attendance , the public is saying , " That is enough evidence . 
quit your dithering and get it done . " 
i am concerned that we would find another technicality , another reason for not dealing with the issue . 
i believe the public thinks the evidence is quite clear . 
would the honourable senator agree that , once the committee has or has not heard from the senator , it make a firm decision regarding this matter ? 
we cannot afford to continue on forever like this . 
senator Stollery : 
then support the report and we can get going . 
senator Stanbury : 
i know this arises from frustration , and I am frustrated too . 
however , if the Senate wanted to pass the kind of motion that Senator Ghitter has put this afternoon without looking for authority or evidence or background or giving Senator Thompson a chance , it would have done so on December 16 . 
if you do not want anything upon which to base your decision , then you do it immediately . 
that is great , except that you take the consequences . 
what was the job of the committee ? 
if Senator Thompson did not attend , the matter was referred to the committee , and the committee was given two weeks in which to reply . 
we must do the thing properly , and that is what we decided on December 16 . 
we wanted to do it properly . 
we set up the committee . 
the committee is only asking today for power from the Senate to follow that process . 
senator Stratton : 
if I may , honourable senators , we know the history , and I would agree with the history . 
my concern is that if we do what is being recommended and the senator does not turn up next week , the committee will end up in another discussion , and , lo and behold , there is another technicality . 
do you not think that there should be something definitive put to the committee saying that if he fails to show , you must recommend expulsion ? 
senator Stanbury : 
the Senate requires that the committee report with recommendations within two weeks . 
why are you jumping the gun and asking the committee not to do its job ? 
you are the ones who asked the committee to do it , and you are the ones who set the deadline , and that deadline is in two weeks ' time . 
senator Grafstein : 
honourable senators , I do not think we should get bogged down here . 
the answer to each senator ' s question is in the draft report . 
let me briefly go through them . 
senator Pitfield says we should let the leaders have some time . 
if the report goes forward , they will have time to discuss things . 
senator Lawson has a concern about the legal position , and the committee can deal with that and answer his questions within the next two weeks . 
if Senator Ghitter has a question with respect to the power of the Senate for expulsion , that can be dealt with by the committee as well . 
senator Beaudoin has raised an interesting question with respect to the inherent right and whether or not we have the power , and that can be dealt with at committee as well . 
senator Stratton has a question about concrete results , and the committee will come up with a concrete recommendation . 
i am confident that the chairman will come up with concrete recommendations . 
senator Lynch - Staunton has told us with great persuasion , time and time again , that we should follow the procedures that have been laid down in the rules . 
that procedure is that we delegate the question to the committee , allow the committee to do its work , and then it can come forward with recommendations to let the Senate do its work . 
that is precisely what we have done in that recommendation . 
every concern raised by every senator , including the comments of Senator Pitfield , can be subsumed in that report in two weeks . 
let us get on with it . 
senator Lawson : 
i am persuaded by what Senator Grafstein has said . 
my concern was for fairness and justice . 
because of the haste with which we were proceedings , I felt like we were turning into a lynch mob . 
i am prepared to either amend or withdraw the subamendment , provided that Senator Ghitter is prepared to withdraw his amendment and let it go through the committee process . 
senators Ghitter ' s proposal has had an excellent opportunity to be debated and discussed , and senators have had the opportunity to vent their frustrations , anger and concerns . 
if it would assist the process , I would be prepared to withdraw my subamendment , provided that Senator Ghitter withdraws his amendment , and let the committee go with the process that Senator Grafstein outlined . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , I am afraid that we are coming into a difficult situation . 
there are some serious technical problems in what we have before us . 
i know the Speaker should not interfere . 
may I suggest a meeting with the leadership for perhaps 15 minutes and a suspension of the session during that time ? 
senator Forrestall : 
that sounds like a good idea . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
i am afraid that we might end up in a difficult situation which we will regret . 
senator Carstairs : 
honourable senators , this side would agree with that proposal . 
senator Lynch - Staunton : 
honourable senators , how could I turn down such a pleasant invitation ? 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
do I have the agreement of both sides ? 
senator Prud ' homme : 
honourable senators , I will not be difficult . 
when His Honour asks , " Do I have the agreement of both sides , " you take me as being on this side . 
i am comfortable here , especially with my new seat partner . 
i know I will not be part of the consultation process . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , I thank Senator Prud ' homme . 
i try never to overlook any honourable senators . 
while I am aware that the independents do not have large numbers , they do have the power of unanimous consent . 
i ask that leaders on both sides meet in my chamber . 
the bells will ring at 4:30 to resume at 4:35 . 
is it agreed ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
the sitting of the Senate was suspended . 
the sitting of the Senate was resumed . 
senator Carstairs : 
motion agreed to . 
motion to Authorize Clerk of the Senate to Notify Senator Thompson to Appear Before Rules Committee - Debate Adjourned 
leave having been given to revert to Government Notices of Motion : 
hon. Sharon Carstairs ( Deputy Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , with leave of the Senate and notwithstanding rule 58 ( 1 ) ( i ) , I move : 
that the Clerk of the Senate be instructed to send a letter to Senator Andrew Thompson ordering him to appear before the Standing Committee on Privileges , Standing Rules and Orders on Wednesday , February 18 , 1998 , at 7:00 p.m. in Room 160 - S ; and 
that , when available , transcripts of today ' s debates be transmitted to Senator Thompson . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
is it your pleasure , honourable senators , to adopt the motion ? 
hon. Consiglio Di Nino : 
will this be an in camera meeting or a public meeting ? 
senator Carstairs : 
it will be an open meeting , as was last evening ' s . 
hon. Ron Ghitter : 
on the adjournment , is it to a specific time ? 
if not , how do we get it back on the Order Paper ? 
do we have the undertaking of the government that this matter will be dealt with the Thursday following the requested appearance ? 
senator Carstairs : 
the item will appear on the Order Paper tomorrow with wording to the effect that it is by agreement that we will not debate it until we have received the report following Senator Thompson ' s appearance , should he appear before the committee , and any recommendation . 
remember , the Standing Committee on Privileges , Standing Rules and Orders has a limit of two weeks under the standing order of this house of December 16 . 
they must report with all of their recommendations no later than two weeks following the referral of the matter . 
i can give Senator Ghitter our commitment that there will be no extensions to that . 
senator Ghitter : 
honourable senators , I should like to propose an amendment to the effect that the matter be adjourned until the Thursday following the meeting and that my motion would come forward automatically at that time . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
the question before us at the moment is the motion of Honourable Senator Carstairs that a letter be sent to Senator Thompson . 
it has nothing to do with the other motions that were before us . 
the honourable senator is referring to the other debate , which is adjourned . 
the question is on the proposal to send a letter immediately to Senator Thompson , in addition to the effective part of the rules committee report of today . 
hon. John Lynch - Staunton ( Leader of the Opposition ) : 
as the agreement to adjourn the debate on Senator Ghitter ' s amendments is obviously tied in with the decision to send Senator Thompson a letter from the Clerk , it is only fair to explain that my understanding of the adjournment of the debate is that it is adjourned from day to day . 
if we wish to debate it tomorrow , we can debate it tomorrow . 
if we do not wish to debate it tomorrow , we stand it . 
however , it remains on the Order Paper and is up for debate day after day until we have disposed of it . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
that is my understanding of the decision taken when we met in my chambers . 
senator Ghitter : 
thank you for the clarification . 
i withdraw the amendment . 
hon. A . Raynell Andreychuk : 
honourable senators , where will this notice be sent ? 
we have heard today about due process and fairness . 
we need an understanding of where this notice will be sent . 
my understanding is that senators are to reside in the jurisdiction or region from which they come and that notice to the address within that region should be sufficient . 
what will satisfy the committee as due process on that point ? 
senator Carstairs : 
that is a very good question . 
notice will be sent to his residence in Ontario . 
however , the documents will also be hand - delivered to his residence in La Paz , Mexico . 
senator Thompson cannot have delivery to his office because he does not have an office here . 
motion agreed to . 
motion to Further Direct Consideration of Rules Committee - Debate Suspended 
hon. Sharon Carstairs ( Deputy Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , I further move : 
that the Standing Committee on Privileges , Standing Rules and Orders , in their work on the order of December 16 , 1997 , consider all arguments and questions raised in the debates of February 11 , 1998 , and particularly the debate on the amendment proposed by Senator Ghitter . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
is it your pleasure , honourable senators , to adopt the motion ? 
hon. John Lynch - Staunton ( Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , I think we would like to see more than a consideration of the debate . 
we are hoping to get , and the argument has been going on for two hours , a finding on our legal authority , if any , to follow through on Senator Ghitter ' s amendment or some modification thereof . 
we would hope that the committee not only consider the debate and hopefully get enlightenment from it but that the committee ask for legal advice and bring to us a recommendation as to how far this chamber can go in dealing with a member who - and it seems we are unanimous , at least on this issue - is not entitled to sit here . 
how far can we go to ensure that he is no longer a member of this chamber and , as a result , is no longer entitled to the remuneration that he is being afforded ? 
we should modify the motion accordingly to ensure that the committee understands the intent of this chamber . 
senator Carstairs : 
honourable senators , I agree . 
if it is agreeable to the chamber , I would amend my motion to add the words : 
... and to hear legal argument based on that debate . 
senator Lynch - Staunton : 
that is not enough . 
the committee should also report to the chamber on its authority to deal with Senator Thompson . 
what can we do to see that he is no longer a member of this chamber ? 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , it will be difficult to get the wording exactly as you want it . 
this matter is not of the same urgency as the sending of the letter to which the Senate has agreed . 
could we agree to hold this motion until tomorrow so that we can provide a proper draft ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
we will leave the motion of Senator Carstairs suspended with the understanding that tomorrow we will come back with a properly worded motion . 
is that agreed ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
business of the Senate 
hon. Sharon Carstairs ( Deputy Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , there is agreement on the other side - I am sorry I did not have time to discuss this with our independent members - that all remaining items on the Order Paper stand . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
is that agreed , honourable senators ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
the Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.

senators ' STATEMENTS 
the Late John G . H . Halstead 
tributes 
hon. Jerahmiel S . Grafstein : 
honourable senators , sometimes there comes a moment to pause and reflect on the origins of Canada ' s foreign policy that is so active and so respected in all corners of the globe . 
over 70 years ago , a small circle of scholarly , brilliant young bureaucrats , under the tutelage of O . D . Skelton , were gathered by Mr. King as an adjunct to the Privy Council Office in the East Block , just a few steps away from this chamber , to create an independent foreign service . 
they were chosen because they were bright , young , vital , well - travelled , brilliant scholars and athletes who shared common values as sons of the manse or sons of missionaries . 
to themselves and others , they were simply " the brightest and the best . " 
all were imbued with the social purpose gained by their faith . 
all sought to put their values of private morality into public practice in politics and diplomacy , as their parents had in their church . 
notions of morality lay at the heart of their principles and policies . 
the standards of excellence and honesty they set for themselves and others made them exemplars of the public service culminating in the rise and career of one of their own , Lester B . Pearson , public servant , diplomat , Nobel laureate and Prime Minister . 
such was the life of John Halstead who died in Ottawa last Monday at age 76 . 
John was born in Vancouver , educated at UBC and the London School of Economics . 
during the war , he served as a naval officer in naval intelligence in the North Atlantic , Britain and Germany . 
his skills in German led him to the interrogation of U - boat prisoners and , after the war , naval elements of the German high command , tracking down suspected war criminals . 
on his return to Canada , he joined the foreign service . 
in his 36 - year career as a public servant , which spanned most of the Cold War , he rose rapidly in the Department of External Affairs from Assistant Undersecretary , to Ambassador to Germany , and then to NATO . 
John was a superb writer and a strategic thinker . 
John ' s career included stints as visiting professor and lecturer at Georgetown , Carleton , Queen ' s , Dalhousie , Windsor , think tanks in the United States and universities in Germany . 
he was an active member of the Institute of Strategic Studies . 
however , John ' s great love was Europe , NATO and Germany . 
John and I shared a deep interest in German literature and history . 
it was in this latter capacity that I came to know him as a member of the Atlantik Brucke . 
for over a decade , we met annually in Canada or Germany to discuss Canada - German and - European relations . 
when he was awarded the Order of Canada in 1996 , he said the following : 
government is not there to make a profit . 
government is there to serve the people who elected it . 
John would always think ahead with clarity and concision . 
i offer my condolences to his wife , Jean , and his son Christopher . 
canada and the foreign service will be diminished by his death , as we are all by his loss . 
he will be sorely missed by his many friends throughout North America and across Europe . 
Godspeed , John . 
crisis in Health Care System 
hon. Erminie J . Cohen : 
honourable senators , the declining level of federal support in New Brunswick is putting our health care system in jeopardy . 
this is a matter of great concern . 
last week alone , in four editions of Saint John newspapers , these headlines cried out from the front pages : 
crumbling Health Care 
exhausted Doctors Seek Relief 
medical Cutbacks Hit Home 
doctors Will Plea For Help 
beyond the borders of New Brunswick , during the same week we heard similar sentiments expressed in Montreal , where the backlog of elective surgery patients was reaching crisis proportion . 
Ontario was appointing a task force to investigate the growing number of problems in their health care system . 
it is becoming increasingly clear to all Canadians that the steady decline in federal government support has all but pulled the rug from under our valued health care system . 
in a December 8 , 1997 press release , Finance Minister Paul Martin declared that , " Governing is about choices , priorities and values . " 
what the Minister of Finance failed to mention was that , since 1993 , his government has cut cash transfers for health , education and social assistance by roughly $ 6.3 billion , from $ 18.8 billion to $ 12.5 billion . 
in seven of Canada ' s ten provinces , cash transfers will continue to fall over the next five years . 
in fact , the seven less wealthy provinces will lose a further $ 384 million per year by the year 2002 . 
this is the problem . 
honourable senators , we must realize that " bare minimum " spending in the area of health care has very human consequences . 
in the words of Dr. Gregg MacLean , president of the Saint John Medical Society : 
the problem is ... underfunding . 
we see those wait lists just growing and the increasing frustration on the part of the surgeons and the family doctors who have to face the patients every day and tell them that the surgery is delayed and try to explain why they can ' t have it . 
honourable colleagues , increased patient suffering , under - equipped and understaffed hospitals and ever - growing waiting lists are all the evidence we need to conclude that our cherished public health care system is crumbling . 
the LATE MR. JUSTICE MARK MCGUIGAN , P . C . , Q . C . 
tributes 
hon. G � rald - A . 
honourable senators , a few weeks ago the Honourable Justice Mark McGuigan departed this world . 
he was born on Prince Edward Island in 1931 . 
he studied law at Osgoode Hall and Columbia University . 
a law professor and dean , he excelled in his university career . 
elected to the House of Commons in 1968 , and re - elected in 1972 , 1974 , 1979 and 1980 , he became Minister of External Affairs in 1980 and , thereafter , Minister of Justice in 1982 . 
after an academic career , followed by a political career , he started a judicial career . 
in 1984 he was appointed to the Federal Court of Appeal of Canada . 
he was a very learned judge , and his judgments will be remembered . 
in 1995 , he was awarded the Walter Tarnopolsky Medal for Human Rights for his work in the field of human rights and freedoms . 
in 1972 , he co - chaired , with Senator Molgat , a joint committee of the Senate and the House of Commons on constitutional reform . 
mark McGuigan was a jurist and a scholar of the very first order , a parliamentarian with creative imagination , a recognized authority on constitutional law and human rights , an impressive judge with great knowledge of the law , and possessing good judgment and , finally , a philosopher . 
the Senate 
quality of Debate in the Chamber 
hon. Bill Rompkey : 
honourable senators , I rise to offer my congratulations to all those who took part in the debate yesterday afternoon . 
i did not take part myself , so I had the opportunity to listen . 
i do not think I have ever heard a better debate than I heard yesterday . 
i am talking here of all of those who participated ; I will not single anyone out . 
i think that the quality of the debate , in terms of the vigour and the articulate nature of the reasoned debate that we heard , was a credit to this institution . 
what happened yesterday was perhaps a defining moment for us . 
we analyzed ourselves and our powers . 
it may be that Senator Thompson was a lightning rod , but sometimes lightning can have a beneficial and useful purpose . 
the debate we had yesterday had a beneficial and useful purpose . 
i congratulate both the committee that brought forth their report , and also Senator Ghitter . 
all those who spoke were well - meaning , whether it was a question of now , later or how we should do it ; that is what we tried to define yesterday . 
visitors in the Gallery 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , before I call for the tabling of documents , I should like to draw your attention to the presence in our galleries of a group of students from the University of Vermont . 
they are participating in the Canadian Studies Program . 
they are here on their forty - second annual Spring field trip to Ottawa . 
for the last few years their host in Ottawa has been Senator Prud ' homme , who took over from our former colleague Senator Heath Macquarrie , after his retirement . 
on behalf of the Senate and all senators , I wish you welcome to the Senate of Canada . 
hon. Senators : 
hear , hear !

rights of the Unborn Child 
establishment of Special Joint Parliamentary Committee - Notice of Motion 
hon. Stanley Haidasz : 
honourable senators , I give notice that on February 25 , 1998 , I shall move : 
that a Special Joint Committee of the Senate and the House of Commons , to be styled the Special Joint Committee on the Unborn Child , be appointed to examine and report upon the feasibility of legislating in the area of fetal rights and the protection to the unborn child , with particular reference to : 
( a ) the lack of protection in current Canadian law of the unborn child ; 
( b ) the interests of the state in providing some measures to protect the unborn child , thereby securing the well - being of future generations of Canadians ; 
( c ) the application of the rights and freedoms entrenched in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and how they relate to the unborn child ; 
( d ) the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in the 1997 case , Winnipeg Child and Family Services ( Northwest Area ) v. G . ( D . F . ) , which signaled a gap in current Canadian law respecting the rights of the unborn ; and 
( e ) the comments made by the Supreme Court of Canada , in the above - noted case , that any measures to provide protection in law to the unborn child have complex ramifications and , as such , should be considered by Parliament , not the Canadian courts , since Parliament is in a better position to assess the desirability , the impact and the consequences of such measures ; 
that the committee take into consideration Canadian and international law , and in particular , the Criminal Code amendment , in 1969 , to the homicide provision concerning the killing of a child before or during its birth ; 
that the committee report back to Parliament with proposed alternative measures to protect the unborn child in a manner that is consistent with the Constitution of Canada ;

Iraq 
canada ' s Policy in Current Crisis - Notice of Inquiry

honourable senators , I give notice that on Wednesday next , February 18 , 1998 , I will call the attention of the Senate to its lack of full accessibility to Canadians with disabilities , and to a means for dealing with disability issues . 
question PERIOD 
agriculture 
wheat Board - Amount of Unpaid Balance Owing - Government Position 
hon. Leonard J . Gustafson : 
honourable senators , I have a question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate relating to grain sales by the Canadian Wheat Board to various countries . 
there has been a great debate in the Prairies about how much money is now owing on the accounts for such sales . 
numbers of up to $ 20 billion , $ 6 billion and $ 8 billion have been mentioned . 
what is the unpaid balance owing to the Canadian Wheat Board at this time , and who carries the expense if their should be a loss ? 
is it the farmers , the government , or the Canadian Wheat Board ? 
if it is the Canadian Wheat Board , then it is the farmers . 
is interest being paid on the money that is owing ? 
hon. Eric Arthur Berntson : 
round it to the nearest billion . 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , that kind of question , obviously , as the honourable senator understands , will require some research not only on my part but on the part of the appropriate authorities . 
i will bring a complete answer at the earliest possible date . 
having said that , legislation is being introduced in the other place relating to the Wheat Board , Bill C - 4 . 
when that bill arrives at the Senate , that will give us an excellent opportunity to examine the Wheat Board and the costs involved , and any payments that are due or overdue in full detail . 
the Economy 
decline in Disposable Incomes - Possibility of Tax Cut - Government Position 
hon. Duncan J . Jessiman : 
honourable senators , I have a question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate . 
since this government was elected in the fall of 1993 , incomes have stood still in real , after - tax terms . 
indeed , according to research from the Library of Parliament , if you take out inflation , per capita personal disposable income has actually fallen by three - tenths of a percentage point since this government was elected . 
in comparison , per capita personal disposable income has climbed by 7.1 per cent in the United States in real terms over the same period . 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
as the honourable senator knows , traditionally there has been a difference in after - tax incomes between Canada and the United States . 
having said that , I know that the Honourable Senator Jessiman , who keeps track of such indicators assiduously , will recognize that all of the other income indicators are on the rise in Canada . 
one of the reasons we are in such a healthy state is that the income indicators are on the rise , and have been for some considerable period of time . 
fisheries and Oceans 
snow Crab Harvest in Gulf of St. Lawrence - Possibility of Allocation from Next Year ' s Quota to New Brunswick Inshore Fishers - Government Position 
hon. Fernand Robichaud ( Saint - Louis - de - Kent ) : 
honourable senators , my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate . 
new Brunswick ' s inshore fishers are worried and living in uncertainty . 
the lobster fishery is declining and , for the most part , this is the fishery they rely on . 
as the minister knows , inshore fishers have had access to the snow crab fishery in the Gulf of St. Lawrence in recent years . 
given that inshore fishers have already taken snow crab and have managed the small share granted them well , would the Leader of the Government in the Senate tell us whether inshore fishers will be returning to fish snow crab in the Gulf next season ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , as a former Minister of State for Fisheries and as an individual representative who has followed these issues carefully , Honourable Senator Robichaud knows that , in recent years , the Gulf crab resource has been shared with inshore fisheries on what has been regarded as a temporary basis . 
this sharing was based on established principles of conservation , viability of the existing license - holders and no permanent increase in harvesting capacity . 
if I remember correctly , for 1997 until the year 2001 , the department approved a co - management arrangement with southern Gulf crab fishers . 
this includes a sharing regime for non - crab fishers based on a viability threshold for the traditional fleet . 
the level of sharing each year depends on the price of crab and on the total allowable catch . 
senator Robichaud : 
could the Leader of the Government in the Senate tell us whether the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans is now considering setting aside a coastal zone for snow crab fishers ? 
inshore fishers have requested this for a number of years now . 
perhaps the minister is considering a permanent quota for inshore fishers , with due consideration , of course , for the best measures for conserving the snow crab stock . 
senator Graham : 
i believe the answer to the first part of the honourable senator ' s question is in the affirmative . 
i do not know about a permanent arrangement , but I know that the minister is awaiting the final scientific advice . 
he is awaiting a report from an independent committee which was established , as well as input from the industry itself , before he makes any decisions on the 1998 fishery , including sharing with non - crab fishers . 
i will bring that information forward to my honourable friend as soon as it becomes available . 
national Defence 
awarding of Contracts for Mid - Life Overhaul of Aurora Aircraft - Possibility of Direction of Contracts to Nova Scotia Contractors - Government Position 
hon. J . Michael Forrestall : 
honourable senators , my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate . 
approximately two days ago , we heard from this government , by way of a press release , that yet another contract for the mid - life overhaul of the CP - 140 Aurora has now been let , this time to Array Systems Computing Inc. of Toronto , Ontario , for $ 1.5 million . 
is this another attempt to tender this contract in piecemeal fashion and away from its possible direction toward the life extension program team in Nova Scotia where a fledgling , though very competent , aviation industrial base is developing ? 
could the minister tell me whether this action precludes a call on the federal authority to direct the balance of the Aurora mid - life overhaul to a team of Nova Scotia and Atlantic aviation firms ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , I applaud Senator Forrestall again for his continuing interest in the aeronautics industry , particularly as it relates to his own region of the country . 
i assure him that any contracts awarded would have been awarded on the basis of merit and would be totally transparent . 
any award would not prohibit any further action - nor should it - with respect to what is being done or being planned in Nova Scotia or in other provinces with respect to developing an aeronautics industry . 
senator Forrestall : 
the minister seems to have forgotten our series of questions about this matter several months ago . 
what we have here is a drop in the bucket , as far as the aviation industry in Canada generally is concerned . 
it would lend significant support to the several thousands of people already in the aviation industrial complex . 
at that time , we discussed the possibility of government , in their wisdom , looking at the fledgling industrial base and directing that contract to the overall team already in place . 
that team has been in place for some time . 
that was the point , namely to direct the contract and not to put it out in a piecemeal fashion until its work was diminished to the point of having no lead contract and no local base for the mid - life overhaul . 
is it too late for the government to direct that contract to that Nova Scotian team so that the industrial base might benefit ? 
senator Graham : 
honourable senators , I do not know that the answer would be any different if it was asked yesterday or today , two hours into a pre - election period . 
i am sure the honourable senator will agree that the bidding process must be totally transparent . 
whether or not it is possible , in particular cases , to direct a contract in order to support a developing , burgeoning , aeronautics industry in a particular province , that is something else again . 
senator Forrestall : 
would you like a list of precedents ? 
senator Graham : 
if there are precedents , I would be glad to receive them to support my argument on behalf of our region along with my colleague ' s . 
i will await with keen anticipation , and not astounded amazement , for any help or representations that Senator Forrestall might give me in the representations which I will make vigorously to my colleagues who are responsible for awarding such contracts . 
senator Forrestall : 
honourable senators , I provided such a list a few months ago . 
the Leader of the Government did not see fit to act on it then . 
we are now on a different footing . 
this is one of the major opportunities for provinces like Nova Scotia to stand up and insist that we benefit from the central pot . 
here is an opportunity . 
the leader knows that the government can direct that contract . 
there is an election on . 
let us do something for Nova Scotians . 
some Hon. Senators : 
hear , hear ! 
Iraq 
hon. No � l A . Kinsella ( Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , I have a question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate . 
honourable senators may recall my question on Tuesday of this week with reference to my concern about the strategic bombing of sites in Iraq and the possible releasing of toxic materials , should such bombing take place on those sites . 
yesterday , The New York Times printed a letter to the editor , the headline of which reads : " Bombing Iraq May Unleash a Toxic Threat . " 
the article states : 
if the United States and Britain undertake a bombing campaign against Iraq , targets will probably include suspected chemical and biological weapons factories and stockpiles . 
yet attacks on these sites might release plumes of biological or chemical toxins into the air . 
my question is : 
has the Government of Canada done any kind of risk analysis on the release of such toxins , whether biological or chemical , should bombing be directed at targets or sites where there is a store of these biological and chemical weapons ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
i do not believe the letter to the editor in The New York Times is anything new or provides any news to people who understand the terrible situation that we face in that part of the world . 
i am confident that strategic analysis is ongoing and has been the subject of discussions between world leaders such as President Clinton , Prime Minister Blair , Prime Minister Chr � tien , and so on . 
as I indicated yesterday , this has been the subject of ongoing discussions between our diplomats at home and around the world . 
agriculture 
Razing of Abandoned Grain Elevators on Prairies - Loss of Storage Capacity - Effect on Rural Municipalities - Government Position 
hon. Mira Spivak : 
the concern is that they are refusing to sell their abandoned elevators to willing buyers , either farmers who wish to use them or municipalities who wish to lease them to local cooperatives . 
instead , they are tearing them down and burning them . 
will the Leader of the Government ask his colleague to investigate the serious concerns that rural municipalities have expressed about this situation ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , without having the advantage of discussing this previously with Minister Vanclief , I am not able to give an answer . 
i am sure he is monitoring the situation ; what he is doing about it is another matter . 
i would be happy to bring this issue to the minister ' s attention immediately after the session is adjourned . 
on other occasions when I have raised matters with Minister Vanclief , he has acted on them promptly and I am sure he will do so in this instance . 
senator Spivak : 
honourable senators , I have a supplementary question . 
the previous Minister of Agriculture , in his wide - ranging study on the future of agriculture , was particularly concerned about rural development . 
my concern deals with de - population . 
as the elevators and the short lines disappear , the towns might disappear . 
the one other thing I wish to bring to the attention of the Leader of the Government is that the Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities just passed a resolution concerning this issue . 
their solution is that they be allowed to expropriate these elevators on the last day of closure , including the equipment , and then they would have the power to operate them or sell them to locally formed cooperatives or to use them for grain storage or for car - loading by the area farmers . 
farmers consider this a serious issue . 
i would be most grateful if the leader would convey that information to the minister . 
senator Graham : 
the information that Senator Spivak has just conveyed with respect to a resolution passed by the Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities with respect to expropriation seems to be a logical and sensible course to follow . 
i shall bring a more complete answer to the honourable senator as soon as possible . 
the Economy 
tax Breaks for Low Income Canadians and Senior Citizens - Possible Increase in Basic Personal Exemption - Government Position 
hon. Marjory LeBreton : 
honourable senators , I have a question for the Leader of the Government . 
shortly before Christmas , Statistics Canada released some shocking news about incomes in Canada , especially about those in the low income bracket . 
the government currently collects $ 200 million a year in income taxes from persons earning less than $ 10,000 a year . 
is the government giving any consideration to using the so - called fiscal dividend to remove low income Canadians from tax rolls , specifically through an increase in the basic personal exemption ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , I am sure that is being considered . 
i would suggest we all wait to hear from the Minister of Finance in his February 24 budget . 
senator LeBreton : 
i will try to give the government a few good ideas , then . 
a trend had developed whereby the number of senior citizens classified as being in a low income bracket had begun to fall . 
indeed , statistics show that seniors in this bracket fell from 34 per cent in 1980 to 18.7 per cent in 1995 . 
increasing the basic personal exemption would remove a burden from a great many seniors , and it is to be hoped that the government will act to ease the situation for our senior citizens . 
is the minister able to give our seniors some hope on this front ? 
senator Graham : 
although the system continues to be sound , it is coming under increasing pressures that require change to ensure its long - term sustainability and affordability . 
in terms of economic pressures , we have costs that are escalating rapidly because of demographic trends , a change to economic environment with slower economic growth and higher interest rates than when the system was put in place . 
withdrawal of Federal Transfers from Provinces - Effect on Standards of Delivery Systems - Government Position 
hon. Erminie J . Cohen : 
honourable senators , my question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate . 
i know that the honourable senator ' s province , like mine , is among the seven provinces that will continue to experience drastic cuts in funding by the government over the next five years , which will affect our health care services . 
yet both his provincial government and mine are expected to uphold the Canada Health Act . 
can the Leader of the Government advise this chamber as to how the level of service required by the act can be maintained given the withdrawal of these federal transfers ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , we are living in a period of economic restraint . 
we are attempting to balance the budget . 
the Minister of Finance has said that when the budget is balanced , we will devote 50 per cent of the fiscal dividend to reducing the overall debt and 50 per cent to social programs . 
i would hope that a significant amount of that would go to the kinds of health care delivery systems to which my honourable friend is referring . 
national Defence 
efficacy of Anthrax Vaccine Destined for Use on Military Personnel En Route to Persian Gulf - Government Position 
hon. Terry Stratton : 
honourable senators , I have a question that is related to health care , but one which is particularly pertinent to the troops that are presently on their way to the Persian Gulf . 
we have just been informed that the United States has developed a vaccine against anthrax which takes six weeks to take effect . 
as this is one of the greatest potential threats to Canada ' s military force now moving towards the Persian Gulf , could the minister tell this chamber if this is true ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , my honourable friend is bringing news to me . 
i know that anthrax vaccine is being made available and that all those who will be representing Canada in that area of the world , for the purposes we have already discussed , will be inoculated on or before February 17 . 
with respect to the time that it takes for the vaccine to take effect , I am not in a position to comment , obviously , for lack of knowledge . 
senator Stratton : 
honourable senators , I hope the military leaders know what they are doing . 
the military forces are now sailing , on their way to the Persian Gulf . 
that is the concern . 
if this is true - and known by the authorities - how could it have been forgotten ? 
senator Graham : 
the honourable senator raises a valid point . 
i am sure that if this is news to the authorities , they will take it into consideration in any actions that may be taken in the future . 
senator Berntson : 
postpone the war ! 
senator Stratton : 
does the Leader of the Government not think it would be appropriate to determine fairly quickly how this is being dealt with ? 
it would appear that there are lives at stake here , and in considerable numbers . 
senator Graham : 
i am sure it is a concern to every honourable senator in this chamber . 
i shall add the honourable senator ' s voice , and my own , to the concerns which have already been expressed by people who are much more knowledgeable on this subject than myself , and probably Senator Stratton as well . 
orders OF THE DAY 
post - Secondary Education 
consideration of Final Report of Special Committee - Debate Continued 
on the Order : 
resuming debate on the consideration of the Final Report of the Special Committee of the Senate on Post - Secondary Education , tabled in the Senate on December 16 , 1997 . - ( 
honourable Senator Forest ) 
hon. Rose - Marie Losier - Cool : 
honourable senators , I would like the motion to remain in the name of Senator Forest , but I would like to speak to it today . 
i am pleased to speak today to the report on post - secondary education in Canada . 
first off , I would like to acknowledge the contribution of the committee chair , Senator Lorne Bonnell , who has done an excellent job for over a year now . 
senator Bonnell was well aware of the problems facing our Canadian universities and our Canadian students . 
he had come to realize that the state of our post - secondary education was deteriorating , and that all Canadians were affected by this . 
his contribution to raising awareness of the ongoing problems facing Canadian students goes beyond this report . 
more and more , Canadians are becoming distraught as they realize that we are facing a major crisis . 
i think Senator Bonnell accomplished what he intended to do , and I sincerely thank him for his great work and wish him the best . 
thanks to this report , we have an up - to - date view of the Canadian post - secondary education system . 
it indicates , however , that much remains to be done . 
students ' financial situation was the focus of much of the testimony during the committee ' s deliberations , but we must not lose sight of the intangible advantages of a post - secondary education . 
it broadens an individual ' s horizons without limit . 
educated people benefit the rest of the population in a thousand ways . 
student debt has made the headlines in all the media for more than a year , and with good reason . 
no other single issue was of such concern to the witnesses who appeared before the committee . 
committee members did their best to look at important issues such as international education , student mobility and the quality of instruction , but none of these subjects was as pressing and important as the level of student debt . 
indeed , since 1990 , the average debt load of students who receive loans under government programs has risen from $ 8,700 to a figure that should hit $ 25,000 this year . 
are these excessive amounts for a student from an average Canadian family ? 
i am sure you will all agree with me that this is an exorbitant figure . 
with the prospect of such future debts , you will agree that it is hard to convince families who can afford to do so to put money aside to educate their children and for long - term adult education . 
i am delighted with this new initiative which was designed to be completely independent of the government and to make it easier for low - and middle - income families in particular to have access to post - secondary institutions . 
young Canadians with lower incomes are greatly in need of such initiatives at this time , to help them to enter and pursue the post - secondary studies which have become so essential these days . 
in my opinion , these scholarships ought to be awarded in two categories , one for financial need and one for academic merit . 
as far as R & D is concerned , we heard many cries of alarm because we are falling noticeably behind in this area . 
witnesses all regretted the lack of effort by Canada in the area of R & D compared to the other industrialized countries and to its major economic partners . 
Sweden , for example , earmarked 3.26 per cent of its GDP for research and development , while the figure for Canada was 1.5 per cent . 
many newspapers deplore the fact that so many brilliant Canadian researchers are moving south of the border to pursue their careers . 
but the United States devoted 2.66 per cent of its gross national product to research and development , and supported 7.4 researchers per 1000 in the labour force . 
canada , with its meagre 1.5 per cent , supported only 4.7 per 1000 in the labour force . 
canada is still lagging behind all the major OECD countries except Italy . 
the recommendation that follows is one of the benchmarks the committee tried to present in its report . 
i quote : 
that the Federal Government make a long - term , strategic and detailed commitment to funding research and development in post - secondary institutions by : 
( a ) committing to the immediate goal of raising Canada ' s investment in research and development to the average of the other OECD member countries within five years . 
this will be no easy task . 
the objectives of the various provincial governments tend to vary from province to province . 
i sincerely believe , however , that Canadians do not need to be convinced of the benefit to our society of having high quality post - secondary institutions . 
our universities must be repositories of knowledge . 
several of our recommendations call for a more prominent leadership role by the federal government with respect to matters respecting post - secondary education that are deemed to be in the national interest . 
throughout the committee ' s deliberations , I realized how great a need there was for the provinces and territories to deal with a single agency created to ensure that the objectives of and results obtained at the University of Moncton compare with those of the University of Saskatchewan . 
we are therefore proposing a special agency which would serve as a locus of internal coordination and external articulation . 
such an agency would help the government better play its role in post - secondary education . 
the report says , and I quote : 
... such a mechanism would provide the Federal Government with a source of strategic advice in this area of critical national importance and would send a powerful signal that Parliament recognizes its significance . 
an interesting section of the report underscores clearly the situation of universities located in regions where francophones constitute a minority . 
new Brunswick and Ontario are the two main areas , but the situation is true in Nova Scotia , Prince Edward Island , Manitoba and Alberta too . 
the report provides , and I quote : 
the support share they receive from the provincial governments and the federal government almost universally lags behind the relative size of the local francophone population , and they lack the funds to develop as many new courses as are needed . 
... the francophone minorities ' universities and colleges in Canada are very concerned that , because they are relatively small and recently established , their needs will not be met . 
the members of the special committee , however , believe that these institutions should be treated as the capstone of the French - language school system outside Quebec . 
and the report recommends , and I quote : 
that the federal government ensure that the funding assistance offered to minority language post - secondary institutions take into account the special needs of francophone minority institutions for additional funding to allow them to catch up to the range of programs offered in other colleges and universities . 
all of the members of the special committee urge the federal government to act quickly to meet the needs of the francophone minority post - secondary institutions in Canada . 
in this connection , honourable senators , I would like to speak if I may of the Universit � de Moncton , a New Brunswick university which serves a population pool of francophones who are mainly from that province . 
in fact , 90 per cent of the 6,000 students on the three campuses of the Universit � de Moncton are from New Brunswick . 
these three campuses , which are situated respectively in Moncton in the southeast of the province , Shippagan in the northeast , and Edmunston in the northwest , represent more than mere university campuses for the people in those regions . 
thanks to their involvement and lead role in the community , the three Universit � de Moncton campuses provide francophones with the opportunity to benefit from these centres with their strong community presence . 
that is why I shall always back the concept of a three - campus Universit � de Moncton . 
i sincerely believe that the Universit � de Moncton deserves our attention and our assistance so that it may broaden its influence throughout the francophone community , whether in Acadia , in Canada or elsewhere in the world . 
in conclusion , honourable senators , very simply , I shall repeat the three points I see as the keynotes of this report : first , financial assistance to Canadian students , who are in great need of help to lighten their financial burdens ; second , an increase in the amounts allocated to R & D in order to slow down the brain drain of our best researchers into neighbouring countries ; and last but not least , particular assistance for the French - language universities in minority francophone communities , so that they can help the Canadian francophonie to flourish . 
hon. No � l A . Kinsella ( Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , I move adjournment of the debate in the name of Senator Andreychuk . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , the order stood in the name of the Honourable Senator Forest , and the Honourable Senator Losier - Cool had permission to speak . 
if no other senator wishes to speak at this time , I suggest that we leave this item on the Order Paper in the name of the Honourable Senator Forest . 
senator Kinsella : 
agreed . 
on motion of Senator Kinsella , for Senator Forest , debate adjourned . 
criminal Code 
customs Act 
bill to Amend - Second Reading - Debate Adjourned 
to deal with such incidents , this bill would authorize customs officers to effect arrests . 
they would not be armed . 
the RCMP would back them up , if necessary . 
this is a delicate issue . 
there are legal , administrative and Charter implications . 
it should be studied carefully in each of its details by the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs . 
on motion of Senator Kinsella , debate adjourned . 
cardinal Ambrozic 
motion to Convey Felicitations of Senate on Appointment of His Eminence 
hon. Stanley Haidasz , pursuant to notice of February 10 , 1998 , moved : 
honourable senators , it was with great jubilation and pride that members of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toronto received in January , this year , the happy news that His Holiness John Paul II had appointed to the College of Cardinals , His Grace Archbishop Aloysius Ambrozic . 
this great distinction has come to an eminent Canadian of Toronto , who arrived in this country as a refugee from Slovenia . 
excelling in his studies at institutions of higher learning , he was later appointed rector of St. Michael ' s College of the University of Toronto , which he served with distinction . 
this stalwart shepherd and pragmatic ecumenist , with deep familiarity of the pulse of a great cross - section of Canadian society , has earned great confidence and respect . 
furthermore , the cardinal elect was always interested in the deliberations of Parliament and especially of the Senate during our great debates on life issues . 
i recall vividly his telephone conversation with me on that occasion , seeking further information and clarification on these issues and the proposed legislation . 
his many achievements and his valued service to the church have been recognized by His Holiness John Paul II , elevating him to the status of Cardinal and Prince of the Roman Catholic Church . 
therefore , honourable senators , I urge that you support this motion . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
is it your pleasure , honourable senators , to adopt the motion ? 
motion agreed to . 
banking , Trade and Commerce 
committee Authorized to Examine Governance Provisions of Canada Pension Plan Investment Board Act 
hon. Sharon Carstairs ( Deputy Leader of the Government ) , for Senator Kirby , pursuant to notice of February 10 , 1998 , moved : 
that the Standing Senate Committee on Banking , Trade and Commerce be authorized to examine and report upon the governance provisions set out in the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board Act ( previously Bill C - 2 ) ; 
that the committee be authorized to permit coverage by electronic media of its public proceedings with the least possible disruption of its hearings ; 
that the committee be authorized to adjourn from place to place in Canada for the purpose of pursuing its study ; 
that the committee be authorized to engage the services of such counsel and technical , clerical and other personnel as may be necessary ; and 
that the committee present its final report no later than March 31 , 1998 . 
motion agreed to . 
the Senate 
on the Order : 
that the Standing Committee on Privileges , Standing Rules and Orders take into consideration the Senate debate of February 11 on its interim report related to its Order of Reference of December 16 , 1997 , particularly with respect to the amendment that was moved ; 
that the committee be authorized to obtain the advice of legal counsel in the matter of the power of the Senate to expel , suspend or otherwise deprive Senator Thompson of his seat in the Senate ; and the ability to withhold Senator Thompson ' s sessional indemnity and expense allowance , whether his current status as a member of the Senate is modified or not , and ; 
that the committee submit its recommendations thereon as soon as possible or , in any case , no later than when it presents its final report on February 24 , 1998 on its Order of Reference of December 16 , 1997 . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
i understand there has been agreement to some small changes . 
perhaps we could clarify the situation . 
hon. Sharon Carstairs ( Deputy Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , after distribution of the motion , I received from our resident " Editor - in - chief of the Senate , " Senator Doyle , some editorial corrections to the motion . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
first , are the editorial changes agreeable to honourable senators ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
hon. Eymard G . Corbin : 
honourable senators , in my view , the first paragraph in the French text is incorrect . 
i will read it to illustrate my point : 
it seems to me that the second line should instead read : 
... tienne compte des d � bats du S � nat du 11 f � vrier sur son rapport provisoire suivant son ordre de renvoi du 16 d � cembre 1997 . 
otherwise , it sounds like the interim report has yet to be written when in fact it is already before us . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , are there any other comments on Senator Corbin ' s suggestion to substitute the word " sur " for the word " dans " ? 
hon. No � l Kinsella ( Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , if we compare it to the English text , I wonder whether it would not be better to use the conjunction " et " and not the preposition " sur , " because the English version uses the word " and . " 
hon. G � rald - A . 
Beaudoin : 
when the French reads : 
... tienne compte des d � bats du S � nat du 11 f � vrier ... 
it relates to the interim report ; the debate is about the report . 
hon. John Lynch - Staunton ( Leader of the Opposition ) : 
not exclusively . 
senator Corbin : 
the report was about the report . 
senator Beaudoin : 
the word " relatif " covers all the debates relating to the report . 
it is all - inclusive . 
senator Lynch - Staunton : 
we only have two weeks . 
senator Beaudoin : 
i suggest " relatif . " 
senator Lynch - Staunton : 
everything is relative . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
i have several suggestions . 
the last would be that we change the word " dans , " instead of using " relatif , " in which case it should read " relatif � " ce rapport . 
is that acceptable ? 
senator Beaudoin : 
Yes. 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
we will remove the word " dans " and substitute " relatif � " ce rapport . 
is there agreement ? 
senator Beaudoin : 
hon. Shirley Maheu : 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
would this solve the problem ? 
is it agreed ? 
everyone agrees . 
we must proceed with the motion . 
it was moved by Senator Carstairs , seconded by Senator Atkins , with leave of the Senate and notwithstanding rule 58 ( 1 ) ( f ) , 
that the Standing Committee on Privileges , Standing Rules and Orders take into consideration the Senate debate of February 11 and its interim report related to its Order of Reference of December 16 , 1997 , particularly with respect to the amendment that was moved ; 
that the committee be authorized to obtain further advice of legal counsel in the matter of the power of the Senate to expel , suspend or otherwise deprive Senator Thompson of his seat in the Senate ; and the ability to withhold Senator Thompson ' s sessional indemnity and expense allowance , determine whether his current status as a member of the Senate is modified or not ; and 
that the committee submit its recommendations thereon as soon as possible or , in any case , no later than when it presents its final report on February 24 , 1998 , on its Order of Reference of December 16 , 1997 . 
would you like me to read the French ? 
il est propos � par l ' honorable s � nateur Carstairs , appuy � par l ' honorable s � nateur Bacon , avec la permission du S � nat et nonobstant l ' alin � a 58 ( 1 ) f ) du R � glement du S � nat , 
que le comit � permanent des privil � ges , du R � glement et de la proc � dure tienne compte des d � bats du S � nat du 11 f � vrier et de son rapport provisoire suivant son ordre de renvoi du 16 d � cembre 1997 , particuli � rement en ce qui concerne la modification qui a � t � propos � e ; 
que le comit � soit autoris � � obtenir l ' avis d ' un conseiller juridique sur la question du pouvoir du S � nat d ' expulser , de suspendre ou de priver autrement le s � nateur Thompson du si � ge qu ' il occupe au S � nat et de sa capacit � de retenir son indemnit � de session et son allocation pour frais , que son statut actuel de membre du S � nat soit modif � ou non ; et 
que le comit � pr � sente ses recommandations � ce sujet le plus t � t possible ou au plus tard le 24 f � vrier 1998 , lorsqu ' il d � posera son rapport final sur son ordre de renvoi du 16 d � cembre 1997 . 
senator Lynch - Staunton : 
honourable senators , unfortunately I detect an inconsistency between the French and English in the fourth paragraph where we use the word " determine " in English , whereas in French , we use " quelque soit son statut ... " 
why is the word " determine " in there ? 
we are not asking for a determination . 
we are asking about the ability to withhold Senator Thompson ' s sessional indemnity , whatever his current status as a member may be . 
that is , rather than determine his status , we must decide , whatever his status , what we can do regarding his indemnities . 
in French , it is correct the way I heard Your Honour read it , but in English the word " determine " slipped in and , on rereading that , it does not seem to fit . 
senator Maheu : 
i agree with Senator Lynch - Staunton . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
i assume that we are now on a point of order on the text so that there may be some free discussion . 
in the French , I wonder if " obtenir l ' avis additionnel " needs to be added . 
i do not know . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
i will take the last proposal first . 
it is moved by the Honourable Senator Kinsella that the following be added to the French text in the second paragraph , in fact the third : 
is it agreed , honourable senators ? 
honourable Senator Lynch - Staunton questions the English text and proposes that , instead of saying " determine whether his current status , " we would say " whatever his current status . " 
is that agreed , honourable senators ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
it is agreed that that is the final text . 
is it your pleasure , honourable senators , to adopt the motion ? 
some Hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
senator Maheu : 
No. 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
on division , then . 
senator Maheu : 
honourable Senator Joyal would like to see something else corrected , and I would like him to explain it , rather than me . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , I have called the motion . 
are we agreed to revert ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
hon. Serge Joyal : 
honourable senators , if we changed the original English version by putting " determine " in the place of " whether is , " I would respectfully submit that this would have to be reflected in the French version . 
if I understand correctly , if we add the words " determine current status as a member " to the English text , it means the status of the senator will have to be determined . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
in the English text we removed " determine whether " and we have changed it to read " whatever . " 
is that agreed ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
that the Standing Committee on Privileges , Standing Rules and Orders take into consideration the Senate debate of February 11 and its interim report related to its Order of Reference of December 16 , 1997 , particularly with respect to the amendment that was moved ; 
that the committee be authorized to obtain further advice of legal counsel in the matter of the power of the Senate to expel , suspend or otherwise deprive Senator Thompson of his seat in the Senate ; and the ability to withhold Senator Thompson ' s sessional indemnity and expense allowance , whatever his current status as a member of the Senate ; and 
that the committee submit its recommendations thereon as soon as possible or , in any case , no later than when it presents its final report on February 24 , 1998 on its Order of Reference of December 16 , 1997 . 
i have called the motion . 
is it your pleasure , honourable senators , to adopt the motion ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
motion agreed to .

the Honourable Finlay MacDonald 
tributes on Retirement 
hon. John Lynch - Staunton ( Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , last November , a dinner was held at the Ch � teau Laurier to honour our recently retired colleague Finlay MacDonald . 
it was an evening that attracted some 200 people , of whom a dozen or so were asked to share their thoughts and appreciation or , as such events tend to encourage , their lack of appreciation of the guest of honour . 
three senators were among the numbers present that evening . 
i certainly hope that if the other two speak today , they will not find as inhibiting as I do this adjustment from the freedom allowed by the " off the record , let it all hang out " concept of that event to the " everything you say here will be recorded for posterity " caution imposed on senators ' tributes . 
this is not to say that Senator MacDonald ' s many activities in this place were ignored ; only that narrations of his activities elsewhere attracted more attention and interest , and with good reason , as it turns out . 
on the other hand , had the speakers on that evening elaborated on Finlay the senator , one evening would not have been enough to list all of his accomplishments during his 13 years here . 
Finlay never hid his ambition to be a senator . 
the Ottawa Citizen of March 28 , 1987 , contained an article which described the long road which brought Finlay to the Senate ; a road not at all smooth , by the way : 
Finlay MacDonald had worked for it as long as he would remember . 
he almost had it in the bag once , but it wasn ' t going to be . 
so he ' d waited - five years , three months and seventeen days . 
it had been a long road for Finlay MacDonald . 
provincial Party president , three elections , Chairman of Robert Stanfield ' s '72 campaign , Chief of Staff . 
he ' d been a senior adviser to Joe and Chairman of Brian ' s transition team . 
five and a half years in charge of the Party ' s war chest . 
he ' d built a PC Canada Fund from nothing , and now it was the envy of the Grits . 
he ' d left it with 65,000 donors , a mailing list to make you green . 
they had a computer there to make your head swim . 
he never got a dime for that work . 
honourable senators , lest this confirm that only party loyalty brings you here to this chamber , let me remind you of Finlay MacDonald ' s active participation in the broadcasting industry and his numerous community activities , including St. Francis Xavier University and the Shaw Festival . 
in 1969 , he was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada " in recognition of his efforts and those of some 2,000 volunteer members of the 1969 Canada Games Society , of which he was President , which ensured the success of the First Summer Games . " 
Finlay ' s passionate support as a member of the Progressive Conservative Party never stopped him from staking out a position of his own when he felt that the PC government was moving in the wrong direction . 
when sitting on the other side , I would not hide my annoyance at his not toeing the party line , although I have to admit that , when viewed from this side , such behaviour is most commendable and to be encouraged , as it is an example of democracy at its finest . 
honourable senators , I need not give you any kind of a list of the accomplishments that must be credited to the senator from Halifax who , in his 13 years here , was known and appreciated on both sides as a constant attendee and vigorous contributor to the work of the upper chamber . 
we must always be grateful for this candour , and for his determination in many of the matters we have addressed in recent years . 
senator MacDonald ' s work as chairman of the special committee which examined the cancellation of contracts at Pearson airport left this chamber with an example of arduous and long - term work manfully done and honestly reported . 
any doubts regarding the conclusions of the majority on that committee have been dispelled by no less an authority than Stephen D . Lerner of Winnipeg , whose specialty is aerospace law . 
the federal government erred when it cancelled the Pearson Airport Agreements . 
as much as this is vindication for the chairman and his colleagues on the committee , it should not take away from the wisdom of Finlay ' s reflections on his experiences during the Pearson inquiry , which can be found in the June 18 , 1996 Hansard . 
i commend them to all , as they are from one who , as well as being a diligent and conscientious participant in our deliberations , was an acute and thoughtful observer of the Senate and its role and responsibilities within the Canadian parliamentary system . 
while he will be greatly missed in this place , retirement from the Senate for Finlay is only another step in an active life that still has many years ahead of it . 
i have no doubt that we have not heard the last of or from him . 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , at the dinner for Senator Finlay MacDonald , which was referred to by the Leader of the Opposition and held in Ottawa several weeks ago , the audience was indeed regaled with stories by a host of Tories and a small group of Liberals , including the likes of myself . 
i had the distinct honour of both eulogizing and vilifying my long - term fellow Cape Bretoner and friend before the largest group of Red Tories gathered together since the Diefenbaker train , fittingly enough , I thought , in the Laurier Room of the Ch � teau Laurier . 
early in life , we both became broadcasters - Finlay was much more successful than I - and we dabbled in politics . 
the 1958 federal election campaign became a watershed from which neither one of us ever turned back . 
a few days after the election , I went to Halifax to seek solace and comfort from my friends . 
that was 40 years ago . 
i was scuttled for the second time in a week by my friend - now sitting and smiling up in the gallery . 
i was crushed and mortally wounded , I thought at the time . 
however , what goes around , comes around . 
now you are up there , Fin , and I am still down here ! 
i guess we always had a lot in common . 
as Shaw once said about the credentials for budding politicians : 
a lot of people at the time might have thought that applied to us both . 
back to the retirement bash for Senator MacDonald . 
will I be perceived as a wolf in sheep ' s clothing , or the reverse ? 
maybe history will tell lies , as it often does , or maybe I will be seen as a kind of martyr . 
as a great man once said : " Yes , martyrdom ... the only way in which a man can become famous , without ability . " 
however , there we all were , applauding , lauding and laughing with the ageless charmer , the silver fox himself , and celebrating the career of one of the most entertaining people this town has ever known - also one of the hardest working senators on the Hill . 
he served on many committees , including Legal and Constitutional Affairs and Internal Economy . 
he was deputy chairman of Banking , Trade and Commerce and National Finance . 
when he was chairman of Transport and Communications , he and I did a lot of puffing and blowing over the then government ' s intention to privatize the Truro - to - Sydney rail line . 
we chugged along together , making our points , and sometimes , I suspect , mischievously trying to out - manoeuvre the other , always with what we each thought was the public good uppermost in our minds . 
Finlay worked hard and supported all good causes in Nova Scotia and many across the country , although on the issue of the shortline sale , I felt at the time that he was on the wrong side of history . 
no matter , he was always a man of independent mind and believed in what he did , and the devil take whoever tried to dissuade him from his convictions . 
not that he was not a team player . 
he was , most of the time , but he is one of the few people I have met who could vote against his own government , sail through the onslaught , and still be invited to the Prime Minister ' s soir � es . 
honourable senators , it seems to me that Senator MacDonald ' s spirit , determination and incorrigible optimism have made a lot of people happy over the years . 
as for his enemies ? 
well , he has picked them very carefully . 
Finlay , when I think of you , I think of one of the Tory greats of yesterday , Prime Minister John A . Macdonald , who may have been your match in personal charm and certainly cut the same kind of dapper and rakish figure . 
sir John A . once said : 
when fortune empties her chamber pot on your head , smile and say " We are going to have a summer shower . " 
senator MacDonald , may the chamber pots of life always turn into the soft and gentle rain of happiness . 
we certainly miss you down here . 
our warmest best wishes to you and Lynn in your retirement years . 
hon. Norman K . Atkins : 
honourable senators , I , too , was at the November dinner in honour of our friend , and I wish to pay tribute to him today . 
i have known Finlay for over 45 years and have worked with him one way or another on many events since 1953 . 
he was a provincial strategist for the Progressive Conservatives in Nova Scotia and was for a time president of the Nova Scotia PC Party . 
he served on the national executive of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada and was a candidate in a federal election in Halifax in 1963 . 
he chaired the Progressive Conservative national campaign in 1972 , chaired the PC Canada Fund , and was chief of staff to the Right Honourable Robert Stanfield and to the Right Honourable Joe Clark . 
in paying tribute to him today , I have decided to take the high road , to discuss his work , rather than putting on the public record his escapades which occurred while we shared a home together here in Ottawa for 11 years , except to say we had many laughs and interesting times . 
as we all know in this chamber , it has become commonplace in the media to criticize the method by which people become senators . 
for years we have been inundated with stories about the superiority of selection through popular election over the present appointment system . 
the framers of our Constitution must have had Senator MacDonald in mind when they established the type of Senate that we were to have . 
it was Sir John A . MacDonald who said : 
there would be no use of an Upper House if it did not exercise , when it thought proper , the right of opposing or amending or postponing the legislation of the Lower House . 
it would be no value whatever were it a mere chamber for registering the decrees of the Lower House . 
it must be an independent House having a freed action of its own , for it is only valuable as being a regulating body , calmly considering the legislation initiated by the popular branch , and preventing any hasty or ill - considered legislation which may come from that body . 
senator Finlay MacDonald , in what he has done in the 13 years he has been here , typifies the trusts which our constitutional framers placed in the Senate . 
the opportunity for Senator Finlay MacDonald to exercise this independence came quickly after his appointment . 
in his first month in the Senate , namely in January , 1985 , he opposed his own government ' s act to provide borrowing authority based only on Finance Minister Michael Wilson ' s economic statement the previous November . 
since no budget or Main Estimates had been presented at that time , the borrowing bill was held up for over a month until the Main Estimates were presented . 
over the following years , Finlay voted against his own government eight times . 
he opposed the bill that eliminated the Economic Council of Canada , the Law Reform Commission of Canada and the Science Council of Canada , and other bills too complicated to mention . 
in 1993 , he became ballistic in his fight against the bill which would have merged the Canada Council and the Social Science and Humanities Research Council . 
he proposed an amendment to kill the merger and , as Hugh Windsor wrote on June 3 , 1993 : 
he made legislative history . 
it was the first time any Conservative senator had attempted to change , improve , modify or defeat any piece of government legislation in the nine years since Mr. Mulroney took office . 
his amendment was defeated 31 to 27 . 
Undeterred , on third read he managed to convince four Conservative senators , including me , to join with him . 
he caught his own colleagues unaware by asking other Tory senators to abstain , and then by voting with the Liberals . 
the entire bill was defeated on a tie vote , 39 to 39 . 
it was the first time that the Senate had defeated a government bill since 1939 . 
as a matter of fact , every bill the Senate has defeated , namely , the abortion bill , the Pearson airport bill and the death of the gerrymandering Electoral Boundaries Act , has the fingerprints of Senator Finlay MacDonald all over it - and mine , too , I am proud to say . 
he led the charge in caucus and in the Senate to save Radio Canada International , our shortwave service , the voice of Canada . 
the index of Debates of the Senate records that since January , 1985 until the present time , he has spoken in the chamber 283 times , and God knows how many times he has spoken during the sittings of the nine committees on which he served , three of them as chairman ! 
i believe he would say the most interesting time he has spent in this place came during his tenure as chairman of the Special Senate Inquiry into the Pearson Airport Contracts . 
while others may have shrunk from this onerous task , Senator MacDonald not only volunteered but also actively campaigned for the job . 
while some in this chamber may have found fault with the majority opinion of that committee , Senator MacDonald steered the committee through the charted waters of summoning by subpoena government witnesses , and through thousands of pages of documents placed in evidence . 
above all , under his chairmanship , this committee of inquiry demonstrated the positive work that can be done by this chamber at a fraction of the cost of a royal commission . 
it has become popular in the press lately to criticize senators because of their attendance records - that is , records of their lack of attendance . 
let me set out the record of Finlay ' s attendance . 
senators are permitted to be absent without excuse for 21 days in each parliamentary session . 
the Clerk of the Senate , who keeps the attendance , has verified that during his entire 13 years in the Senate , Finlay missed only 25 days . 
that is less than two days a year . 
i believe , with Senator MacDonald in this chamber , that Canadians have been well served . 
in the years I have known Finlay , I have come to admire him and , in particular , his sense of humour , his boundless energy , his sense of fairness , his political instincts , and his enthusiasm when faced with a difficult challenge . 
this adds up to a senator who has had a great influence on my life , and one for whom I have great respect . 
i only hope that he will find new challenges to occupy his time . 
he has energy and enthusiasm , and he is not a person to remain idle . 
may he continue to serve his community and country for a long time to come . 
hon. Sharon Carstairs ( Deputy Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , I grew up on Inglewood Drive in Halifax . 
Mr. MacDonald lived on the next street . 
i was not allowed to call him Finlay in those days ; he had to be Mr. MacDonald , in the jargon of the era . 
he was a Conservative . 
that was the only misjudgment my father ever thought Finlay MacDonald had made . 
my father was a great admirer of what he thought was a genuine , self - made man who had given of his talent and his ability to others - both in the political process and to the many charitable organizations which have not been discussed here , but to which all Nova Scotians know that you have given during your many years of contributions to that province . 
among the admiring things that my father used to say about Finlay MacDonald , there was one in which there was just a tinge of jealousy . 
on a number of occasions , my father had been placed on the best dressed list for men in the country , but my father was only five foot five and a half inches tall . 
he was very jealous that Senator MacDonald was equally as dapper , but had more height to give more splendour to the clothes in which he was dressed . 
Finlay , you are held in great esteem by this chamber . 
i want you to know that you are also held in great esteem by my family , despite your political lack of sagacity . 
hon. Philippe Deane Gigant � s : 
honourable senators , I was conditioned to be suspicious of Conservatives . 
my father used to say , " Conservatives do not have hearts , they have wallets . " 
when I was five , instead of reading me bedtime stories , my mother would read the editorials of the Athens Liberal paper . 
soon , I said to myself , " Well , if someone like him can be a Conservative , maybe there are some decent Conservatives . " 
to my great surprise , I found out that , yes , indeed , there are some of you whom I like - not all of you , but I might even say most of my colleagues opposite . 
you have failed in one thing , which I will illustrate by relating what occurred when I was coming out through the Senate door with my very beautiful sister - in - law . 
i was kissing her on both cheeks , following our lunch together . 
in walks Finlay and he says , " Me , too . " 
he grabbed her around the waist , did a complete sort of tango flip , and gave her a very long kiss on the mouth . 
i said , " He is a Conservative senator . " 
she said , " I think I will vote Conservative next time . " 
hon. John Buchanan : 
honourable senators , I also would like to pay tribute to Finlay MacDonald . 
i know quite a few things about Finlay that I will not relate today . 
Finlay MacDonald : family man , fellow Cape Bretoner , war veteran , broadcaster , graduate of St. F - X University of Antigonish , politician extraordinaire , member of the Order of Canada and , as a dear friend of his mentioned to me this morning , and as I knew , the life of the party wherever a party was held . 
i think Finlay will know who related that to me . 
he is in Halifax and also a neighbour of his in Chester . 
as Senator Atkins mentioned , Finlay was president of the PC Party of Nova Scotia in the mid - 1960 s . 
he was a great president of the PC Party . 
that was about the time that I got involved in politics . 
in 1963 , Finlay ran in the federal election . 
although he lost , he won just about every poll in a constituency which two years later was called Halifax - Atlantic . 
i knocked on many doors with Finlay during that election . 
his debonair ways , his wit and his excellent campaigning ensured that he would win a majority of those polls . 
i was a member of the cabinet of Nova Scotia at the time and attended many of the functions . 
the talk of the neighbourhood where Finlay lived was that the Prime Minister of Canada , Pierre Elliott Trudeau , visited Finlay ' s home at the time . 
many of the people in that neighbourhood , both Liberals and Conservatives , were very pleased that the Prime Minister had taken the time to visit in that part of Halifax . 
the Canada Games were a huge success , due to the hard work of many , but primarily of Finlay MacDonald . 
all of this is primarily due to the efficiency and hard work of Finlay and the people who worked for him at IEL . 
here in the Senate , Finlay has been a very efficient and hard worker . 
as Senator Atkins has already indicated , he has been a faithful attender , chairman of many committees over the years , and has always defended the Senate of Canada . 
i have known Finlay for almost 40 years . 
i knew his family in Sydney . 
his father was a Conservative Member of Parliament from Cape Breton South for ten years . 
Finlay , congratulations to you on your good work over the years and on all of the endeavours I have mentioned in which you were involved . 
some of you might not know that Senator MacDonald ' s real name is not Finlay MacDonald . 
in Cape Breton and at St. F - X , to many of the young ladies of the day he was known as Ernie Finlay MacDonald . 
i bring you greetings , Finlay , from some ladies in the Boston area who told me to ensure that I address you as Ernie Finlay MacDonald . 
you will know who I mean . 
i should say that Senator Graham knows those ladies as well . 
i am getting in deep now . 
in closing , Finlay MacDonald is a credit to Cape Breton , a credit to Nova Scotia and a credit to Canada . 
well done , good and faithful servant of Cape Breton and Nova Scotia . 
do not take this wrong , but many were the nights , during annual meetings of the PC Party , that I would go up to the suite where there were a bunch of people and find Finlay and Mavis on the floor doing their exercises . 
that is why they were both in such good shape . 
i do mean " exercises " in the common sense . 
Finlay , Mavis and I extend our best wishes to you and Lynn as you return to Halifax . 
well done . 
senator Graham : 
i should like to indicate that when Senator Buchanan speaks of the ladies in Boston he is talking about his sister and relatives . 
hon. Joyce Fairbairn : 
honourable senators , in December of 1984 , I was doing my Christmas shopping on Sparks Street one very snowy and cold day when someone grabbed me by the arm , spun me around and said , " Hey , did you see that I appointed Finlay MacDonald to the Senate ? 
what do you think ? " 
it was Brian Mulroney . 
i looked at him sternly and said , " It ' s about time . " 
so it was . 
for a long time , Finlay MacDonald has understood and respected the system of government , knowing also that it was not infallible . 
he knew about the role of political parties in that system better than most , and he regarded politics always as an honourable occupation . 
he saw communications and culture as absolutely critical to national unity , and I strongly agreed with him all along the way . 
as a parliamentarian , he acted with diligence and , as many have said , with integrity and with humour . 
Finlay MacDonald has been a political opponent of mine for over 30 years , but also a personal friend . 
i hope he never stops adding to the contribution he has already made to his province and to his country . 
i wish him and Lynn many happy years together . 
distinguished Visitors in the Gallery 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , I should like to draw the attention of the Senate to the presence in our gallery of our distinguished former colleague , Honourable Senator Finlay MacDonald . 
i note that Senator MacDonald is accompanied by another long - standing senator , Honourable Senator Lorne Bonnell . 
pages Exchange Program with House of Commons 
the Hon. the Speaker :

on my right is Sue - Anne Fox , from Montreal . 
she is enrolled at the University of Ottawa in the faculty of administration , with a major in marketing .

he is enrolled in the faculty of social sciences . 
i welcome both of you to the Senate and hope that you will find your week with us a productive one . 
the HONOURABLE M. LORNE BONNELL 
tribute on Retirement 
hon. Wilfred P . Moore : 
honourable senators , I rise today to make a statement in tribute to Senator M. Lorne Bonnell , who retired from this honourable chamber on January 4 , 1998 , upon the occasion of his 75 th birthday . 
senator Bonnell entered public life in 1951 when , while still carrying on a busy medical practice , he was elected to the House of Assembly of Prince Edward Island . 
he was re - elected in general elections held in 1955 , 1959 , 1962 , 1966 and 1970 . 
in addition to being an elected member , the good doctor also served his fellow Islanders as Minister of Health , Minister of Welfare , Minister of Tourism and Development , Minister Responsible for Housing , and Liberal house leader . 
in 1965 , he served as acting leader of the Liberal Party of Prince Edward Island . 
he knew how to get elected and stay elected . 
on November 15 , 1971 , Dr. Bonnell was appointed to the Senate of Canada by the Right Honourable Pierre Elliott Trudeau . 
no doubt because of his medical training and experience , Senator Bonnell exhibited a strong interest and deep concern for the youth of our country , their health and education . 
among the highlights of Senator Bonnell ' s distinguished career in the Senate must be his chairmanship of the Standing Senate Committee on Health , Welfare and Science , which produced a report in 1980 entitled " Child at Risk . 
" that report and its contents are as much in vogue and as relevant today as they were 18 years ago . 
of equal importance was his chairmanship of the Special Committee on Post - Secondary Education which , in December 1997 , produced a report that will be an important blueprint respecting the education of our youth and how we approach this very important issue in the years ahead . 
senator Bonnell ' s office in Room 265 - E was a gathering spot for many senators from both sides of the house . 
there you would be treated to good conversation , lively stories and warm fellowship . 
the good doctor was quick to dispense medications or libations depending upon your need or request . 
after such sessions you revelled in frequenting the Caf � de la Promenade for a meal of Chinese food chased with a beer . 
on a personal note , when I came to this place in the fall of 1996 , Senator Bonnell took me under his wing . 
he showed me around . 
he explained the operations and traditions of this honourable chamber , the functioning of its officers and the interests of the personalities seated herein . 
we two Maritimers quickly became good friends . 
i shall always be grateful for the interest that he took in me and the many courtesies he extended to me . 
a devout family man of consummate energy , Senator Bonnell has returned to his beloved Murray River where he attends to his patients in his medical practice and oversees his various business interests . 
with 20 years in the House of Assembly in Prince Edward Island , 27 years in the Senate of Canada , Senator Bonnell has provided a total of 47 years of service to his fellow Islanders and Canadians , a distinguished record that required commitment , integrity and energy . 
senator Bonnell has done his island and Canada proud . 
senator ' S STATEMENT 
the Senate 
apology for Remarks Accredited by Media as Opinion of Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee 
hon. Phillippe Deane Gigant � s : 
honourable senators , I wish to apologize to the members of the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on which I have the honour to serve . 
in answer to a citizen ' s letter urging me to support Bill C - 220 , which would take away the copyright of people found guilty of some offences , I said that I thought the committee considered the bill unconstitutional and badly drafted . 
i did not have the right to speak on behalf of the committee . 
i should have said that this was my opinion alone that this bill is unconstitutional , badly drafted and does not do anything for victims ' rights . 
please forgive me .

question PERIOD 
national Defence 
efficacy of Anthrax Vaccine Destined for Use on Military Personnel En Route to Persian Gulf - Request for Answer 
hon. Terry Stratton : 
honourable senators , I address my question to the Leader of the Government . 
as he is aware , I asked a question last week concerning the inoculation of our troops with the anthrax vaccine for their work in the Persian Gulf . 
in that information I gave him , was indicated that it would take six weeks for the vaccine to have an effect or take hold , which might be too late should all heck break loose over there . 
does the honourable senator have a response as yet in regard to this question ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , I have consulted with my colleagues . 
as late as this morning , I discussed this issue with the Minister of National Defence . 
i have been assured that he has been assured by the medical doctors in the armed forces that indeed our armed forces personnel will be safe and that immediately upon the inoculation being given , it begins to take effect . 
my understanding is that at the time that our armed forces might be in any danger areas , they would be fully and adequately protected . 
senator Stratton : 
senator Graham : 
i am sure one would receive many varying opinions from medical experts depending upon their particular field of expertise . 
however , I have been informed by the Minister of National Defence that he has the full assurance of medical authorities in the armed forces that the vaccine would take effect in sufficient time so that our Canadian Armed Forces personnel would be fully protected . 
possible Strike by Western Nations - Bombing of Storage Facilities for Weapons of Mass Destruction - Provision of Protective Clothing for Military Personnel - Government Position 
hon. Norman K . Atkins : 
honourable senators , can the Leader of the Government in the Senate also assure us that any member of the service who is assigned to the Persian Gulf will be outfitted with the most up - to - date equipment so that he or she is protected from any possible circumstances that might arise there ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , that is an appropriate and very timely question . 
our ships were designed with this kind of threat in mind , and our personnel have been equipped with protective clothing that enables them to carry out their duties safely , should any of the weapons that have been talked about be used . 
assurance of Protection for Civilians - 
government Position 
hon. No � l A . Kinsella ( Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate . 
what about protection for the innocent civilians on the ground in Iraq , should the bombing that has been spoken of be undertaken , and in particular , bombing of the sites where the biological and chemical materials are stored ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , I am sure the Honourable Senator Kinsella appreciates that every humanitarian effort will be taken to ensure that all possible human lives are safeguarded . 
possible Strike by Western Nations in Conformity with International Conventions of War - Government Position 
hon. No � l A . Kinsella : 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
the answer to that question is a very definite " yes . " 
foreign Affairs 
violence in Algeria - Mission of Members of Parliament - Lack of Senate Participation - Request for Particulars 
hon. Eymard G . Corbin : 
honourable senators , my question is for the government leader in the Senate . 
i apologize for not giving him advance notice of this question as perhaps I should have done . 
he will recall that , before Christmas , I raised in this house the matter of the killing of innocent people in Algeria . 
during Ramadan , over 1,000 people - most of them women and children , but also men - were atrociously murdered for reasons difficult to accept in terms of human rights . 
recently , we have heard that the Honourable Don Boudria has been trying to organize a visit to Algeria by members of the House of Commons - for what purpose , I do not know ; and with what instructions from the Minister of Foreign Affairs for the government , I do not know . 
i think that sort of information would be useful to all members of Parliament . 
in addition , would the Leader of the Government inquire why members of the Senate have not been invited to form part of that mission , if there is , indeed , to be a mission ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
canada is actively involved in looking for the best way to help the victims of violence in Algeria . 
an envoy has already been dispatched to Algeria . 
the results of the visit , I understand , were positive and enabled Canadian representatives to have a frank and open dialogue with the Algerian authorities . 
the Minister of Foreign Affairs has written to the president of the country , and has received a response which I understand was encouraging , and leads Canada to believe that further Canadian initiatives will be welcomed in that part of the world . 
as was indicated , there is hope that the government house leader , Mr. Boudria , will soon be able to go to the area . 
i will determine very shortly whether or not members of this chamber could be part of the delegation , or at least , as a start , determine what the make - up of that delegation will be . 
the Economy 
gap in Disposable Incomes in Comparison with United States - Possibility of Tax Cut - Government Position 
hon. Duncan J . Jessiman : 
honourable senators , the income gap between Canadians and our American neighbours continues to widen , not only because of the drop in the value of our dollar but because incomes are rising faster in the United States than in Canada . 
in the third quarter of 1997 , after - tax income per man , woman and child in the United States was just a bit more than $ 30,000 in Canadian funds . 
put another way , after income taxes , per capita personal income in the United States is now 75 per cent above Canadian levels . 
would the government leader not agree that the time has come to bring down income taxes so that this gap can be narrowed ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , I cannot prejudge or pre - empt what the Minister of Finance will do in his budget . 
i can only suggest that we wait . 
perhaps that is the only answer I have , except to indicate , as I did the other day in response to Senator Jessiman , that that is the pattern that has existed for a long time . 
there is an income gap between citizens of the United States and Canada . 
however , there are many good news economic indicators in our country which bode well for the future . 
whether you want to talk about manufacturing shipments growing by 2 per cent in December , new motor vehicle sales posting their strongest monthly gain of the year , up 14.6 per cent , and so on , all the economic indicators are positive . 
i would hope that in that process , as we approach and achieve the objective of a zero deficit , the income gap will narrow . 
gap in Disposable Incomes in Comparison with United States - Request for Particulars of Studies Conducted 
hon. Terry Stratton : 
honourable senators , I have a supplementary question on the same topic . 
this gap has been widening for a number of years . 
it is of particular concern to Canadians now because it is becoming abundantly clear that we are falling further and further behind as our Canadian dollar has been dropping like a stone . 
has the government done any kind of research to determine the reasons - there cannot be just one reason - behind this ever - widening gap ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
yes , honourable senators , I shall attempt to provide a more detailed answer for Senator Stratton , as well as for Senator Jessiman .

projected costs of the 1 - 800 line is approximately $ 250,000 for the period September 27 , 1997 ( tabling of Bill C - 2 ) to February 14 , 1998 . During the period September 27 , 1997 to January 25 , 1998 , some 32,600 calls were answered . 
purpose of Surplus in Employment Insurance Reserve Account - Government Position 
( response to question raised by Hon. Terry Stratton on November 26 , 1997 ) 
during the last recession , the EI account began to run a large deficit . 
every year since 1994 EI premiums have been reduced . 
EI premiums were reduced again for 1998 , with premiums declining from $ 2.90 to $ 2.70 . 
while EI premiums will be reduced again , the government will not lower premiums such that they have to be raised again in the event of a recession . 
during the last recession , premiums had to be increased to maintain the financial integrity of the EI account . 
clearly , this was not good policy because increasing EI premiums during a recession exacerbates job losses for Canadians .

telecommunications Act 
hon. Marie - P . 
honourable senators , I am pleased to speak today on behalf of Bill C - 17 , which clears the way for Canada to implement the World Trade Organization agreement on basic telecommunications . 
bill C - 17 will amend the Telecommunications Act and the Teleglobe Canada Reorganization and Divestiture Act , thus paving the way for the implementation of this WTO agreement on basic telecommunications . 
a rigorous consultation process took place between the government , industry and the provinces before the agreement was negotiated , and there has been valuable input from numerous witnesses into the final shape of the bill that is now before us . 
this agreement , which is contained in the WTO General Agreement on Trade in Services , or GATS as it is more commonly known , will benefit Canada and the world . 
it will not only dramatically expand the global market in telecommunication services , it will also open a multi - billion dollar global market to Canadian telecommunications companies . 
these markets include the United States , the European Union , Japan , and the developing markets in Asia and Latin America . 
colleagues , this bill contains the legislative amendments necessary to meet our GATS commitments , along with several provisions related to the liberalization of the Canadian international telecommunications market . 
they are the amendments to the Telecommunications Act to exempt international submarine cables and earth stations from the foreign ownership and control restrictions . 
honourable senators , the main purpose of this bill and the agreement it helps implement is to expand , stimulate and liberalize international trade and level the playing field . 
the purpose of Bill C - 17 and the agreement is to open up world markets to Canadian businesses so that they are on a level playing field with their competitors and can thus prosper and create even more jobs for Canadians . 
their purpose is to expand the world telecommunications market so that the telecommunications services available to Canadians continue to grow and improve in quality . 
honourable senators , we know that Canada is a trading country and that international trade contributes strongly to economic growth and job creation . 
we exported goods worth $ 264.2 billion last year compared to $ 148.9 billion in 1990 . 
the importance of foreign trade in goods and services in Canada ' s economic production ranks it first among the G - 7 countries . 
in 1995 , our goods and services exports accounted for over 40 per cent of our gross domestic product . 
it is obvious that foreign trade is what drives our economy . 
we must focus on foreign trade if we are to create the jobs this country needs . 
this is why trade expansion is essential to the federal job creation strategy , a partnership involving the federal , provincial and municipal governments , the private sector and the NGOs . 
one Canadian job in three depends on exports . 
for every additional billion dollars in exports , honourable senators , 11,000 jobs are created or maintained . 
by contributing to the liberalization of international trade , this bill stimulates economic growth and the creation of quality jobs in Canada . 
the telecommunications sector is of particular significance for the economic development of Canada . 
our success in the new knowledge - based economy requires a competitive and dynamic telecommunications industry . 
this vital sector already accounts for 145,000 jobs and 3.4 per cent of our gross domestic product . 
if we encourage the growth of the industry , we will be in a position to compete with the best in the world ; otherwise , we are going to condemn our country and our children to second - class status , sitting back to watch our international competitors take advantage of our missed opportunities . 
i want to take this opportunity to address them . 
canada and 69 other participating countries have made specific commitments under the agreement setting out the terms and conditions by which foreign companies may supply basic telecommunication services in their markets . 
for example , the agreement gives Canadian companies full access to the U.S. market in basic telecommunication services . 
the use of reciprocity tests by the U.S. federal communications commission will be severely curtailed . 
furthermore , Canadian companies will be able to enter other telecommunications markets , such as in the European Union and Japan . 
all of our major developing - country trading partners have agreed to allow foreign competition into their markets as well as foreign investment . 
besides opening their markets , participating countries have also committed to follow the GATS most - favoured - nation treatment and transparency provisions . 
an important part of the agreement is that all participating countries must establish independent , regulatory bodies that are separate from , and not accountable to , the local telephone company . 
in Canada , we already have such a body in the CRTC , which as a model regulatory body is recognized around the world both for its independence and its transparent and open process . 
as a result of this agreement , which includes a dispute settlement provision , we will have multilateral rules for trade and investment on basic telecommunications services . 
it is important to remember that besides benefitting Canada this agreement is good for the world economy . 
that , too , benefits Canada . 
manufacturers will also benefit from the Information Technology Agreement which will eliminate tariffs on information technology products , including computers , semiconductors , and telecommunications equipment , by the year 2000 . 
together , the GATS on basic telecommunications and the Information Technology Agreement , both of which are administered by the WTO , provide a springboard for global economic growth and development . 
the result will be lower prices for consumers and fewer barriers to the spread of technology which is critical to the development of all countries . 
the two agreements cover international business worth over U.S. $ 1 trillion , which is roughly equivalent to the world ' s trade in agriculture , automobiles and textiles combined . 
these will generate increased demand for Canadian telecommunications products as telecom operators around the world gear up for a new global environment of open markets and competition . 
the GATS on basic telecommunications is expected to double or triple the international market for telecommunications over the next decade . 
leading Canadian telecom manufacturers , such as Nortel and Newbridge , as well as many other small - and medium - sized companies across the country , will be free to compete in this dynamic and expanding market . 
the government promised to create jobs for Canadians and to plug Canada into the global knowledge economy . 
these agreements will do just that . 
the GATS will create the same kind of positive conditions for services in trade that the GATT has done for goods and trade . 
the GATT has contributed to a tenfold increase in the volume of world trade in goods since 1947 . 
honourable senators , this is a good agreement for Canada . 
our telecommunications companies are among the best in the world , and they are ready to take advantage of the new international business opportunities that this agreement will create . 
i urge you to act on this bill with all due speed . 
on motion of Senator Kelly , debate adjourned . 
canada Human Rights Act 
bill to Amend - Second Reading - Debate Adjourned 
honourable senators , I rise to speak to my motion for second reading of Bill S - 11 to amend section 3.1 of the Canadian Human Rights Act to include " social condition " as a prohibited ground of discrimination . 
as you know , there are groups of people in our society who are considered vulnerable and in need of special protection from discrimination . 
these groups are listed in the Canadian Human Rights Act . 
this bill simply proposes that we add " social condition " to that list in section 2 , subsection 3 . ( 1 ) and subsection 16 . ( 1 ) . 
promoting a society in which all human beings are equally entitled to be treated with respect , dignity and fairness has been an objective of the Canadian government for more than half a century . 
as you may well remember , I first tabled this bill on December 10 of last year , a date which marked the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . 
these past 50 years have presented us with many challenges , but as we struggle to achieve our ideals , we are motivated by the fact that we are improving the quality of life for all Canadians . 
however , to quote the 1997 report of the Canadian Human Rights Commission : 
canada ' s record as a committed proponent of human rights is only as convincing as its latest performance . 
if a shared belief in the value of equal treatment for all is a measure of our interdependence as citizens , then it is necessary to ask how well the experience of each and every Canadian bears out that belief each and every day . 
it is with regret that I report to you that poverty continues to be one of the greatest barriers to equality in Canadian society . 
poor Canadians live daily with social stigma and negative stereotypes . 
financial institutions , landlords , utility companies , the legal system , public and private media and our governments continue to discriminate against our most vulnerable citizens . 
what I am asking you to do today is to look at poverty through a human rights lens , because it is obvious to me that poverty is , first and foremost , a human rights issue . 
the pervasive social attitude toward the poor has proven to be , time and time again , discriminatory . 
yet more than two decades after signing the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , Canada has failed to amend its own domestic human rights law with respect to poverty . 
honourable senators , the reason we have a federal human rights law is to provide vulnerable groups with protection against discrimination in areas of federal jurisdiction . 
we in this chamber have been presented ample evidence which shows that the poorest 20 per cent of our population experience life differently than the majority of Canadians ; that our constituents who live in poverty have been excluded from the enjoyment of any meaningful participation in society ' s social , economic or cultural life . 
it is my assertion today that the poor in this country face a prejudice similar to the prejudice faced by the other marginalized groups who are listed within the Human Rights Act . 
despite this , there is no direct , legal recognition of poverty as a pervasive source of inequality and disadvantage in Canadian society . 
honourable senators , I am aware that the Canadian Human Rights Commission warns us that the Government of Canada is not able to hand out freedom and equality to Canadians or deliver them from prejudice and discrimination . 
however , I am also aware that they urge us to work towards the formulation of a coherent , purposeful body of law . 
in fact , they believe that the Canadian people have every right to expect that our government , in addition to vigorously enforcing existing laws , will act to strengthen and clarify existing human rights legislation . 
at this point in time , our human rights law is neither clear nor coherent , for we propose to promote equity for all Canadians ; then , by virtue of extending protection to some vulnerable groups and not others , we perpetuate the very kind of discrimination we seek to eliminate . 
in fact , the likely reason that poverty or " social condition " is not located as a prohibited ground within the act is that the poor are so very marginalized , both socially and economically that they lack the political power needed to achieve any influence within our political system . 
let us take it upon ourselves , honourable senators , to rectify this situation . 
first , I should like to present my argument as to why this is an appropriate undertaking for the executive branch of government . 
i first learned of this form of discrimination while working on my report , " Sounding the Alarm : 
poverty in Canada . " 
many of us in this chamber have always lived comfortably . 
many of us can also remember when poverty did not carry with it quite the social stigma that it has today . 
while researching the report , I heard in many cases of how the poor are viewed as though they are worthless simply because they live in poverty . 
they are often treated as second - class citizens . 
in time , many internalize these experiences , and begin to feel great shame and low self - esteem . 
upon learning this , I felt so strongly about these injustices that as one of the four recommendations made in the report , I asked that the federal government take the necessary steps to extend basic human rights protection to those living in poverty by including " social condition " as a prohibited ground of discrimination . 
well , honourable senators , one year has passed , proving the old adage that if you want something done , you had better do it yourself ! 
honourable senators , I am asking you to help our government to correct the omission of " social condition " in our Human Rights Act and , by doing so , improve the lives of those who live in poverty . 
this chamber has a proud tradition of raising the concerns of our less fortunate citizens . 
it took two years of travelling from coast to coast and listening to the poor before the 1971 report of the Special Senate Committee on Poverty was tabled . 
in the past , we have also improved our national human rights standards by adding previously excluded groups who could illustrate that they met the definition of needing special consideration in our society . 
one fine example is our work in relation to Bill S - 2 , to amend the Human Rights Act to include sexual orientation . 
honourable colleagues , it is completely within our role and mandate within the Canadian parliamentary system to embark on these types of challenges . 
in fact , I believe that we in the Senate have a duty to maintain the law , and to act to change it when the opportunity presents itself . 
it is also important that this bill be introduced in the Senate rather than in the other place . 
human rights legislation is , of course , about granting rights to the marginalized and maligned of our society . 
the fact that a group is in need of protection illustrates that they probably do not enjoy widespread support 
by definition , pioneering human rights legislation is inevitably a struggle against popular opinion . 
the poor are so disenfranchised that their issues are not of great concern to most elected officials . 
in fact , with the current trend in " poor bashing , " few politicians who seek re - election will risk political necks to convince a hardened public of the current plight of the poor . 
considering these factors , it is very unlikely that our colleagues in the other place would be able to initiate a similar bill . 
we have the luxury of being somewhat protected against political pressures , given our security of tenure , as we review and amend federal bills . 
hoping I have convinced you of the need for the Senate to initiate this bill , I will now move on to explain why I think that this work is timely . 
frustrated with the lack of legislative initiatives in the area of human rights law , activists have begun to use the judicial system to bring about change . 
in essence , they are able to argue that marginalized groups who are not listed within the charter but who experience similar types of discrimination must be considered analogous to the listed groups , and be treated as such by the law . 
noting their success , other equality - seeking groups are starting to follow suit . 
we were told during the public hearings on Bill S - 5 that anti - poverty groups will soon begin this process . 
it is currently law that analogous groups be treated the same as the listed groups with respect to the Charter . 
their only requirement is to prove to the court that they do , in fact , experience similar discrimination . 
given the testimony I heard , this will not be a difficult argument to make . 
our provinces have also moved several steps forward with regard to social condition as a prohibited ground for discrimination . 
according to The Law of Human Rights in Canada , by Russel Zinn and Patricia Brethour : 
seven provinces prohibit discrimination on the basis of either " social condition , " " social origin , " " source of income , " or " receipt of public assistance . " 
the ground of discrimination applies to all activities covered by the respective legislation , save and except Ontario , in which the prohibition applies solely with respect to the occupancy of accommodation . 
it is customary to keep the bodies of law which govern this country in synchronicity , and we should strive to keep abreast of our provincial legislation . 
i also bring to your attention , honourable senators , the current climate in the field of human rights in our nation . 
the Chief Commissioner of Human Rights , Michelle Falardeau - Ramsay , in her first public address , stated that she wants to use her position to help combat discrimination against Canada ' s poor by fighting to have " social condition " included as a prohibited ground . 
in short , amending the Canadian Human Rights Act to include " social condition " as a prohibited ground of discrimination will meet Parliament ' s responsibility to respect the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . 
this amendment will save poor people the hardship , and taxpayers the expense of litigation to bring the act into compliance with the Constitution and Canada ' s international human rights commitment . 
at this time , I think it is necessary to make completely clear what it is that we are actually asking for with this amendment . 
bill S - 11 does not confer any special privileges to Canada ' s poor . 
it deals solely with the proscription of discrimination , that is , prohibiting a burden . 
to spell this out even further , I am not proposing that the government make poverty itself a violation to our domestic human rights legislation . 
although , our complacent attitude about poverty does contradict what we have signed in international fora , I am not suggesting that our domestic human rights legislation be empowered to take our government to task for not providing an adequate standard of living for all of its citizens . 
all I am asking is that the poor , whether elderly or disabled , working or in receipt of social assistance , man or woman , not be prejudged and discriminated against . 
including " social condition " under the Canadian Human Rights Act would provide explicit recognition of poverty and its related attributes , such as receipt of social assistance , and would prohibit discrimination against the poor within the federal sphere . 
i am also here today in defence of our international reputation . 
as you know , Canada has generally endorsed the principles enshrined in the international covenants . 
however , you may not know that when we sign an international covenant , we also agree to a process of review . 
this is the way the United Nations monitors our compliance . 
at this time , we are being reviewed to ensure that our government ' s actions are in keeping with the International Covenant on Social , Economic , and Cultural Rights . 
honourable senators , I regret to inform you that we , as a government , are not faring well in this process . 
in the report of the last review , the United Nations asked that we take some steps to have our domestic human rights legislation more fully reflect that to which we have signed in international fora . 
however , although it has been almost a quarter of a century since signing the Covenant , we have failed to amend our Human Rights Act to include these basic rights for our most vulnerable citizens . 
however , by extending basic human rights protection , we are keeping our promise to continually improve the lives of Canada ' s poor . 
honourable senators , extending human rights legislation does more than simply uphold an ideal . 
in fact , by promoting human dignity , justice , fairness and equal opportunity , human rights protection could be one of our most powerful anti - poverty tools . 
this is true for several reasons . 
first , human rights law is a powerful educational tool . 
by setting standards , we help to create societal behaviours . 
it also starts a dialogue , so that people and institutions might come to understand more about the lives of those living in poverty . 
i have a wonderful example of how poverty education changed the views of an institution and , in turn , the lives of the poor . 
after years of hard work by the National Anti - Poverty Organization and l ' Association coop � rative d '� conomie familiale du Centre de Montr � al , the Canadian Bankers Association came to a better understanding of the banking needs of low - income clients . 
they began to recognize how their institution discriminates against the poor . 
as a result , they have made a positive commitment to change several banking policies to better accommodate poor Canadians . 
she and her husband own a small home and pay a modest mortgage . 
one day , her husband lost his job . 
after weeks of searching , to no avail , and after draining all other resources , this family was forced on to social assistance . 
the social worker determined that their monthly mortgage was far less than what they would pay in the private market for an apartment . 
there is also a two - year waiting list for public housing . 
she determined that the most efficient , practical solution was to allow this family to continue with their mortgage . 
several weeks later , the father found a part - time job . 
while he was looking for full - time work , the family received a " top - up " benefit from social services and their mortgage continued to be paid . 
several months passed and the time came to renew their mortgage . 
much to their astonishment , the application to renew was denied . 
no consideration was given to the fact that they , through thick and thin , had , without fail , managed to meet their monthly mortgage payment . 
in fact , honourable senators , no consideration was given to their personal circumstances at all . 
the children lost their bedrooms and their backyard . 
the equity they had built up in their house just covered the selling costs . 
they had to move to an urban centre to find accommodation , so the children had to change schools . 
the father spends almost what he makes commuting to work . 
this , honourable senators , is a Canadian tragedy . 
housing advocates tell us that it is a tragedy which occurs daily from coast to coast . 
this type of treatment could be prevented simply by no longer allowing banks to discriminate against social assistance recipients . 
some may feel uncomfortable with the idea of setting further regulations on private enterprise , but you must consider that 96 per cent of housing in Canada is provided by the private sector and therefore requires some regulation if we want to achieve safe , affordable housing for our citizens . 
provinces have realized this and have decided that they must take action in the areas which fall under their jurisdiction . 
to help ensure equity in housing , they have begun to regulate how the private market , or landlords , allocate units . 
take for instance the family who lives in a major urban centre and cannot find housing because landlords do not want to rent to welfare recipients . 
the entire welfare cheque is used to cover housing cost and the family is forced to line up every day at soup kitchens and food banks . 
honourable senators , while a family is suffering this kind of misery , it is impossible for the parents to have the time and resources necessary to look for employment . 
front - line workers in social services tell us that there are many families who cannot obtain stable housing because they are discriminated against as social assistance recipients . 
they tell us that some families live in hotels for months , paying $ 300 to $ 400 per month more than what they would pay for an adequate apartment . 
this is the kind of discrimination the provinces are working against . 
if we work together , we can improve the lives of poor Canadians by making housing more affordable and more available . 
yes , honourable senators , this is a powerful anti - poverty strategy . 
customers who score well on income and credit tests are supplied immediate and courteous service . 
for those without employment income , the situation is much different . 
cases are piling up where people have moved to new accommodation and cannot get hydro or phone services activated if they are unemployed . 
as unimaginable as this may sound , hundreds of Canadians are currently at risk of being denied the essential services of phone , hydro , gas and oil , simply because they are poor . 
phone service , or telecommunications , is the one utility which falls under federal jurisdiction . 
this leaves many people without a telephone , a circumstance that makes looking for work very difficult . 
honourable senators , the General Assembly of the United Nations created a guideline of actions for governments to follow with respect to the International Decade for the Eradication of Poverty . 
one direction was : 
... to formulate or strengthen national policies geared to substantially reducing the inequality experienced by low income citizens . 
i believe that I have shown how this amendment will help to achieve precisely that goal . 
at the World Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen , the Canadian government declared : 
... the new economy has created the human deficit of unemployment and poverty . 
as part of this government , honourable senators , we must take notice of the changes around us and help rectify the situation . 
we need to determine what direction our nation will take as we enter the new millennium . 
for , as we struggle to balance the competing interests inherent in this new global economy , social instability seems to be the necessary trade - off for continued financial security . 
as we attempt to make our way through these massive alterations , untouched and unchanged , the needs of the financially vulnerable are increasingly ignored . 
the United Nations Human Development Program , or UNDP , has noted that this is the situation faced by most industrialized nations . 
they have predicted that , in the long term , our resistance to change will produce disastrous results . 
the 1997 UNDP report strongly urges us to empower the poor as part of the strategy for empowering our nation . 
i ask you today to take this advice and heed their warnings . 
if there is one thing that keeps me awake at night , it is wondering what our nation will look like , how our children and grandchildren will live a generation from now , after the prolonged social exclusion of 20 per cent of our population . 
the current reality is that some groups which have been recognized historically as being particularly vulnerable to discrimination have protection , while others do not . 
let us work together , honourable senators , to stop the discrimination perpetuated against our most vulnerable citizens . 
i urge you to help our government build a society in which there will be a place for all citizens , regardless of their race , national or ethnic origin , colour , religion , age , sex , sexual orientation , marital status , family status , social condition , disability or conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted . 
as senators , we must strive to constantly improve the lives of all Canadians , and we must never hesitate to strive for the moon . 
for even if we miss , we will find ourselves among the stars . 
on motion of Senator Chalifoux , debate adjourned . 
inter - Parliamentary Union 
ninety - Eighth Inter - Parliamentary Conference , Cairo , Egypt - Inquiry 
hon. G � rald J . Comeau rose pursuant to notice of Thursday , December 4 , 1997 : 
this was the first time the Union held its conference in the Middle East . 
we did a lot of research on the political situation in that part of the world . 
it was therefore entirely appropriate for him to say his farewells at a conference held in his own country . 
traditionally , Egypt has played a leading role in the Middle East and has been a cornerstone of regional stability . 
Egypt was the first state to sign a peace treaty with Israel , and maintaining a pivotal role in facilitating the Middle East peace process remains a key Egyptian foreign policy objective . 
both Egyptian President Mubarak and Foreign Minister Arnr Moussa continue to be active in attempts to bring Israel and PLO officials back to the negotiating tables . 
shortly after the conference , we heard many reports about the massacre of tourists in the temple in Luxor , and the problems with extremists . 
throughout our stay , we were very much aware of the high level of security in this country , especially at a conference such as ours where the president and top - ranking officials attended various events . 
in order to maintain its authority , the Mubarak government , with the support of the army , applies a variety of security measures , some of which restrict freedom . 
the security forces ' crackdowns on Islamic militants involve violations of rights and freedoms . 
over the past four years , the Egyptian authorities have continually punished violence by militants . 
including the 50 tourists recently assassinated at Luxor , terrorists have killed nearly 120 people this year , compared to 160 last year and 360 in 1995 . 
some 20,000 guerrilla fighters are being held in prison . 
parliamentary elections in late 1995 saw an estimated 45 per cent of the 21 million eligible Egyptian voters cast ballots . 
nearly 4,000 candidates competed for the 444 seats in the Egyptian People ' s Assembly , including hundreds from opposition parties who had boycotted elections in 1990 . 
i should like to turn now to the conference itself and the work of the Canadian delegation . 
the two main subjects of the agenda were : ensuring lasting democracy by forging close links between Parliament and the people , and employment in a globalizing world . 
i am pleased to report that Mr. Hubbard of the Canadian IPU group was a member of the drafting committee that prepared a resolution for presentation to the final plenary , and he was also elected to the role of rapporteur . 
this was Mr. Hubbard ' s first visit to an IPU conference , and he performed quite a task for a new member . 
during the general debate of the political , economic and social situation in the world , I spoke about the Canada - United States dispute over Pacific salmon and the need to find a reasonable solution to this issue . 
as I said earlier , Mr. Sorour of Egypt concluded his term as Chairman of the Inter - Parliamentary Union at the conference . 
so much of the time in Cairo was spent on choosing his replacement . 
the election was a particularly important one , because the next chairman will have to set the tone for the Union as it faces the challenges of the 21 st century . 
he will also have to work with the new secretary general , who will be appointed on the retirement of the current one , Mr. Pierre Cornillon , on June 30 , 1998 . 
there were three candidates for the presidency : 
Mr. Miguel Angel Martinez of Spain , former president of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe ; Mr. Eduardo Menem of Argentina , President of the Argentine Senate ; and Mr. Sangma of India , Speaker of their Lower House . 
happily , I can report that the candidate supported by the Twelve - Plus Group , Mr. Martinez , won by 127 votes to 88 during the second round of voting . 
Mr. Martinez , who has been active in the IPU since the early 1980 s , has a wealth of experience in the union and in other international fora . 
the work done in the plenary sessions and committee meetings is , of course , extremely important and useful . 
i would , however , like to say a few words about the other activities that took place during the Cairo conference . 
in my view , they are eloquent testimony to the effective role played by parliamentary delegations . 
recently we celebrated the success of Canada in bringing together 121 countries to sign the treaty on a global ban on antipersonnel mines . 
this event was the culmination of efforts by a wide variety of players : foreign ministers , officials , diplomats , grass - roots organizations , and parliamentarians . 
the Canadian IPU group is proud of its work in promoting and encouraging a global ban on antipersonnel mines , including the successful introduction of a debate and resolution on the subject at the Beijing IPU conference in September of 1996 . 
on a personal note , I might add that one of our colleagues , Senator Bosa , has been very forceful on this issue over the years . 
as you are aware , three major international players - China , Russia and the United States - did not sign the mines treaty . 
however , there have been many efforts to encourage these countries to join the Ottawa Process on land mines . 
in Cairo , the Canadian IPU group organized a meeting with the leader of the Chinese delegation to invite China to be a supporter of this international convention . 
although we were not successful in convincing China to sign the treaty , we believe that our work is part of a larger effort to convince Chinese authorities to change their views . 
the second initiative I would like to mention concerns our work with the Asia - Pacific group , one of the Union ' s five geopolitical groups . 
at the present time , Canada belongs to the 12 - plus group , which is made up of the European countries , Canada , the United States , Australia and New Zealand . 
Australia and New Zealand , however , are members both of the 12 - plus group and of the Asia - Pacific group . 
given the importance of our involvement in the Asia - Pacific region and our links with this part of the world for over a century , it seemed appropriate that we should ask to become a member of this group . 
while we were in Cairo , therefore , two members of our delegation explained to the Asia - Pacific group the reasons behind our request , emphasizing Canada ' s various links with this region and , in particular , the fact that it had hosted the last APEC conference in Vancouver . 
another area where members of the Canadian delegation played a vital role was in the promotion of Canada for a non - permanent seat on the Security Council for the term 1999 to 2000 . 
the election will take place in November , 1998 . Members of our delegation met with representatives of selected countries , noting that Canada had made a considerable , constructive and sustained contribution to the United Nations . 
we also underlined that Canada has taken a leading role in promoting effective UN renewal with a view of strengthening the UN ' s capability to serve the interests of the entire membership . 
we noted that Canada is the eighth largest contributor to the UN budget and pays its assessments in full and on time without conditions . 
Egypt has been eligible for development assistance from Canada since 1976 . 
it has for many years now been one of the main beneficiaries of Canadian assistance . 
not long ago , CIDA helped launch a number of projects designed to support the reforms that will enable Egypt to become a more open and more liberal state , through stimulation of its private sector . 
during our stay , certain members of our delegation made field visits to three projects in the Cairo area . 
the first , a community services centre for women from Helwan , is intended to empower women at the bottom of the economic scale , by helping them form a cooperative . 
the second , run by Egypt ' s electricity authority , trains people to work in the field of electrical transmission systems . 
the third , a human rights centre providing assistance to prisoners , seeks to provide prisoners and their families with the means to continue their education by supplying teaching materials and tutorial services . 
in addition , this project provides prisoners with legal aid in connection with human rights violations . 
honourable senators , in conclusion , I should like to state once again that I am firmly convinced that parliamentary associations and the delegations which participate in these conferences play a valuable role . 
the Inter - Parliamentary Union provides a forum where legislators from 135 countries can come together and discuss issues of international importance . 
it also gives us an opportunity to reinforce and support major foreign policy initiatives such as the ban on antipersonnel mines , increased links with the Asia - Pacific region , and a seat on the Security Council . 
i am proud of the work we accomplished and I want to state that the Canadian IPU group will continue to seek opportunities to enhance and expand its effectiveness at future IPU conferences . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , if no other honourable senator wishes to speak on this inquiry , it shall be considered to have been debated .

" 9 . the present Minister of National Defence . " . - ( 
honourable Senator Murray , P . C . ) . 
hon. Lowell Murray : 
honourable senators , we have been told during this debate that we must put the Somalia scandals behind us and move on to other things . 
senator Rompkey and Senator Bryden have told us that the country must move on , that Parliament must move on , that the Canadian Armed Forces must move on . 
it is as if all the evidence of wrongdoing in high places could be wished away . 
it is as if we could all move on to other things , leaving behind us the cloud of disgrace that hangs over the Canadian Armed Forces and over our reputation as a country . 
honourable senators , we may move on , but the cloud will move with us and will stay with us until the truth is known and responsibility is determined . 
what is at issue in the motion we are now debating is not just Parliament ' s right to know the truth . 
the issue , rather , is our duty , our most serious duty , to hold to account those who act in our name and under the ultimate authority of Parliament . 
it is that issue of accountability that I would urge upon you in considering your response to this motion . 
there is to be a Canadian Military Grievance Board . 
there is to be a Military Police Complaints Commission . 
there is to be an independent implementation committee . 
there is to be an ombudsman . 
there are to be toll - free snitch lines , and civilian committees of one kind or another to oversee this and that . 
in such a multi - layered , multi - dimensional universe , accountability will not be more clear and more concentrated . 
it will be more diffuse . 
the Chief of Defence Staff and the Minister of National Defence will have more insulation , more cover , more distance between them and what is going on beneath them . 
is this really the lesson that our military , bureaucratic , and political leadership have drawn from the events in Somalia ? 
one hopes not . 
this is really a matter for another debate , but we should get at it soon . 
i am aware that there are amendments to the National Defence Act which will probably be here in due course . 
perhaps those will provide an opportunity to discuss some of these issues in the appropriate standing committee of the Senate . 
one of those civilians was killed . 
it is the opinion of the attending military physician , Dr. Armstrong , that he was executed gang - land style at close range . 
before the night was over , Dr. Armstrong had been told by a captain in our armed forces that a damage control operation was under way . 
we know what the phrase " damage control " means , do we not ? 
it is a euphemism for officially sanctioned misinformation and cover - up . 
indeed , the commanding officer on the scene , Colonel Labb � , caused an in - house investigation to be instituted by one of the people in his chain of command . 
as a result of that in - house investigation , the platoon was absolved of any criminal wrongdoing and praised for their efforts . 
colonel Labb � wrote to National Defence headquarters in Ottawa to recommend against a military police investigation which , in his words , would discover nothing new . 
a story was concocted , which is part of the strategy that is now a matter of public record , to the effect that the Somalis who were shot outside the compound were saboteurs . 
by this time , there had occurred a second even more atrocious incident . 
i refer , of course , to the March 16 torture , beating and death of the young Somali civilian Shidane Arone , who also had been enticed to the Canadian compound by bait in the form of food and water laid out by our soldiers . 
this incident caused a police investigation to take place , yet it was two weeks before the news of that atrocity was passed on to the then minister , Ms Campbell . 
where was that information during those 15 days ? 
did the senior officers in Somalia fail in their duty to inform senior officers at National Defence headquarters in Ottawa , or was the information passed on to Ottawa and covered up by the authorities here ? 
we do not know the answers to those questions . 
do you not think we have a duty to find out ? 
we do know for certain that during those two weeks outright lies were passed on to the minister and to the public concerning the circumstances of Shidane Arone ' s death and the condition of his body when it was examined . 
a strategy was devised , which is also part of the public record , to de - link the death of Shidane Arone and the attempted suicide of one of the perpetrators . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , I regret to interrupt Honourable Senator Murray , but the time is elapsed . 
is leave granted ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
senator Murray : 
i am sorry , honourable senators . 
i am just getting started . 
before long , the existence of trophy photographs taken by our soldiers became public . 
courts martial were held , and convictions in some cases were recorded . 
the initial cover - up had unravelled quickly . 
however , let me point out that so far as the public record is concerned , none of those who posed for the trophy pictures has ever been disciplined . 
a dozen soldiers stopped by the bunker where the young Somali was being tortured and beaten . 
is it true , as reported in the media , that six of those soldiers have since been promoted , the official explanation being that since they were never charged with anything , their promotions could not fairly be denied ? 
the one thing we do know is that no senior military officer and no senior bureaucrat has ever resigned over what happened in Somalia . 
none has ever accepted responsibility ; none has ever been held to account . 
by November , 1994 , the so - called damage control exercise was unravelling . 
the efforts of some journalists had succeeded in uncovering part of the truth . 
the government decided that a public inquiry was necessary . 
the L � tourneau commission was appointed under the Inquires Act . 
i need not recall for honourable senators the unqualified and categorical assurances of the then Minister of National Defence , Mr. Collenette , that the L � tourneau commission would be able , fearlessly and fully , to establish the truth and assign responsibility . 
it was October , 1995 before the Somalia commission heard its first witness . 
approximately five months later , the commission announced that it intended to look into more recent developments , that is developments that had taken place since its appointment in November , 1994 . Six months after that - this brings us to September , 1996 - Prime Minister Chr � tien declared that the commission was going on too long and was costing too much . 
four months later , the new Minister of National Defence , Mr. Young , announced that the inquiry was being called off . 
when the Somalia commission reported in June , 1997 they were able to offer some findings and conclusions . 
they told us what the premature curtailment of their schedule had prevented them from pursuing , and they presented a convincing , documented and shocking narrative of official obstruction of their judicial inquiry . 
in chapter 38 of the report , honourable senators will find the commissioner ' s examination of the incident of March 4 , 1993 , of the allegations subsequently made of the deficiencies of the summary investigation and of the cover - up that ensued . 
let me read one sentence into the record . 
... the response of the chain of command ... was weak , untimely , inadequate , self - serving , unjustifiable and unbecoming the military leadership that our soldiers deserve and the Canadian public expects . 
it is said that he is now the subject of a career review board . 
to what purpose ? 
to facilitate his promotion ? 
to investigate further his response to the incident of March 4 , 1993 ? We do not know . 
vice Admiral Murray , whose implausible explanation of the delay in sending the military police to Somalia after March 4 is part of the commission ' s record , is now the assistant deputy minister of the Federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans . 
what the commission was not able to do because of the government decision to shut them down , is discussed in their report in a few words , when they say they : 
our schedule was aborted just as we were beginning to question the highest levels of leadership of the Canadian Forces and the Department of National Defence and to the allegations of cover - up with respect to some incidents .... The 
government ' s decision effectively allowed many of those in senior leadership positions during the deployment to avoid entirely accountability for their conduct , decisions , and actions during and after the mission . 
the commission added : 
once again , history repeats itself , in that only the lower ranks have been made to account for the marked failures of their leaders . 
these comments by the commission relate to the March 4 incident and subsequent related allegations . 
the commission was not able to touch at all on the March 16 torture , beating and death of Shidane Arone . 
i wish to draw the attention of honourable senators to the obstruction by senior people in the Canadian Armed Forces and the Department of National Defence of the work of the Somalia Commission . 
no subject is more relevant to the motion that is now before us and to the need to set up a Senate inquiry . 
honourable senators who wish to examine the subject in more detail may do so by reading chapter 39 of the commission report . 
it is clear from the narrative related by the commission that from the very beginning the military authorities and the Defence Department systematically obstructed the efforts of the Somalia Inquiry to obtain documents relevant to its mandate . 
as a result , the work of the inquiry was delayed . 
the staff was constantly preoccupied with these problems . 
the commission decided that the matter was so serious that they should launch special hearings on issues related to the non - production of documents . 
these hearings went on from the fall of 1995 through the winter of 1996 . 
some commentators have criticized the commission for having allowed itself to become bogged down in such a multitude of details , not all of them central to the inquiry . 
perhaps those critics are right , but the commission was faced early in its mandate with clear evidence of obstruction , document tampering and the concealment of documents so felt that it was absolutely necessary to pursue these matters wherever they land . 
the commission ran up against an ad hoc team of civilian officials and military officers called the Somalia Inquiry Liaison Team , better known by its acronym SILT . 
as to the modus operandi of this team , the commission said : 
... rather than assisting with the timely flow of information to our Inquiry , SILT adopted a strategic approach to deal with the inquiry and engaged in a tactical operation to delay or deny the disclosure of relevant information to us ... 
later , the commission reported the : 
... fragmented , dilatory and incomplete documentary record furnished to us by DND ... 
please bear in mind , honourable senators , that the people being spoken of in these terms are senior officers of the Canadian Armed Forces . 
they are senior people in the Department of National Defence , public servants who have taken an oath of allegiance , who have sworn to faithfully carry out the responsibilities entrusted to them in their high offices . 
bear in mind also that this was their response to a judicial inquiry established by Order in Council to ascertain the truth . 
here is what the judicial inquiry said of these people : 
during the hearings , many details of the affair were examined , and witnesses for the most part denied responsibility . 
it was clear , however , that the Department had failed blatantly to comply with our order for production . 
the actions of the Department were , we concluded , dishonest and deliberate . 
to cover the original deception , the severity of misdeeds had escalated from artifice to lies , to non - compliance with an order for production and , finally , to the attempted destruction of evidence . 
they are words of a commission of inquiry to describe the activities of public servants who are ultimately responsible to us , to Parliament . 
how can we , in good conscience , follow the advice of our friend Senator Rompkey to turn the page , to stop scrutinizing the past and to look to the future ? 
how could we possibly justify such an abdication of our responsibility to hold to account those who act under the authority of our laws ? 
deception , lies , artifice , non - compliance with a judicial order , attempted destruction of evidence - so far , those responsible for all of this have got away with it . 
the very people whose conduct was being investigated seem to have succeeded , in January 1997 , in persuading the then defence minister Mr. Young to close down the inquiry . 
from March 4 , 1993 , when the damage control operation began , through the orchestrated in - house investigation , through the conceiving , conspiring , conniving and sanctioning of lies and misinformation , through the tampering with documents and the destruction of evidence , to the successful campaign to shut down the Somalia inquiry , people in high places for whom we are ultimately responsible have evaded accountability , escaped responsibility and eluded the efforts of properly constituted civilian authority - Parliament , government , a Royal Commission - to establish the truth . 
for all that has happened , the bottom line so far is that no one in authority knew anything ; no one was responsible ; no one is accountable . 
how can we , in the Parliament of Canada , leave it at that ? 
if we do not insist on accountability , who will ? 
this is not a very pleasant matter , to put it mildly , but in one ' s mind ' s eye , one goes back to the night of March 16 and the beating and death of Shidane Arone at the hands of our men . 
the Somalia commission was shut down before they could even inquire into this . 
Shidane Arone was 16 years of age . 
he was 5 feet 4 inches in height . 
he weighed 120 pounds . 
he tried to steal some food and he was set upon by brutes who wear our uniform . 
during a long night , he was kicked and beaten and punched and suffocated and burned with cigars , beaten to a pulp with a metal bar , sodomized with a riot stick , and killed . 
in the words that we have heard so often from colleagues on the other side , they moved on to other things . 
still worse is the complicity from that day to this of those up the chain of command , military or civilian , who have dissembled and lied and covered up . 
this motion presents us with a moral choice - whether to do our duty and insist on accountability , ascertain the truth , fix responsibility , however difficult and painful it is , or whether to turn our backs and walk away . 
hon. Philippe Deane Gigant � s : 
honourable senators , I share in the horror that Senator Murray feels . 
we all feel that way about what happened to that young Somali . 
however , I remember , too , the dismay I felt when I looked at CPAC night after night at the conduct of this so - called commission of inquiry . 
for instance , Mr. Desbarats , who could not manage his way out of a wet Kleenex , tried to impugn the honour of an officer because he did not know what was happening five kilometres away . 
i remember that once our ship was firing badly and missing when normally we did not . 
we discovered later that our chief gunner ' s mate had heard in a letter that his wife had had an affair with an American soldier . 
he was devastated and his aim went wrong . 
if we had known that , we could have replaced him with someone else . 
we did not know . 
we were responsible , but things of this sort , unforeseeable , were happening in war time , all the time , everywhere . 
people in the commission of inquiry were trying to pin down an officer for something he could not possibly have known at that time . 
they were questioning with a sort of Kenneth Starr feeding frenzy that was debasing the Canadian idea of justice and injuring the morale of the armed forces . 
if they had treated those officers as fellow citizens with whom they wanted to cooperate in order to get at the truth , it would have been a totally different situation . 
they treated them from the beginning , before anything was proven , as guilty parties . 
i resented that and so did the military and they were right . 
it was time to put an end to that " Starr chamber . " 
senator Lynch - Staunton : 
shame ! 
on motion of Senator Poulin , debate adjourned . 
canada - Japan Inter - Parliamentary Group 
eighth Annual Meeting with Japan - Canada Parliamentarians Friendship League - Inquiry 
hon. Dan Hays rose pursuant to notice of December 11 , 1997 : 
that he will call the attention of the Senate to the Eighth Annual Meeting between the Canada - Japan Inter - Parliamentary Group and the Japan - Canada Parliamentarians Friendship League , held in Japan , from November 8 to 16 , 1997 . 
honourable senators , I would like to address the Senate with respect to the eighth annual meeting of the Canada - Japan Interparliamentary Group and the Japan - Canada Parliamentarians Friendship League which took place in November of last year . 
these were the most successful bilateral meetings to date , both in terms of content and interest on the part of Diet members . 
to that effect , the Canadian delegation was honoured to receive the largest number of Diet members to ever attend the bilateral talks , which included numerous former ministers and former prime minister Kaifu . 
he was in office in 1989 when this organization was first created under his leadership and that of then prime minister Mulroney . 
the bilateral talks dealt with political and economic developments in Japan and in Canada , bilateral trade , investments , tourism , security issues , the forthcoming COP 3 , or Kyoto conference , APEC , as well as administrative reform and deregulation in Japan . 
the talks were particularly interesting in light of the current changes Japan is undergoing to its society , institutions and economy . 
changes to the fiscal structure of Japan ' s economy are of great importance to Canada . 
a highlight of the bilateral talks was the announcement that Prime Minister Hashimoto would announce , while on an official visit to Ottawa , that Japan would sign the Convention to Ban Anti - personnel Mines . 
senator Comeau spoke earlier about the good work of the Inter - Parliamentary Union . 
i can confirm that the Canada - Japan relationship , as well as the multilateral relationship that organization has with Asia - Pacific countries , has served Canada well in encouraging other countries to follow the Canadian example of signing the convention banning anti - personnel mines , which took place in December of last year . 
following the bilateral talks in Tokyo , the delegation visited the Island of Kyushu . 
Kyushu has a population of 15 million and produces 1 per cent of the world ' s GDP . 
it is sometimes referred to as silicon island because of its high - tech production . 
it offers great possibilities for Canadians in the export of forest products , housing products , consumer goods and agricultural products such as beef . 
we were able to meet with the Canadian consul , in addition to visiting a beef production cooperative and robotics plant on Kyushu Island . 
both Hiroshima and Nagasaki are on that island , and the delegation visited the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum and Peace Garden . 
the global economy in technology has made it such that changes occurring in Japan and Asia will have an impact worldwide . 
in view of the importance of the Asia - Pacific to Canada , in particular our economy , it is of prime importance that Canadian parliamentarians be aware of these changes . 
two - way trade now amounts to $ 22 billion with Japan , exports and imports roughly in balance . 
Japanese tourism represented approximately $ 690 million in revenue to Canada in the last fiscal period . 
i also wish to note the professionalism and dedication of our Canadian embassy officials , and I encourage colleagues in this place to join the Canada - Japan Inter - Parliamentary Association . 
this eighth bilateral meeting and our multilateral relationship with the Asia - Pacific characterize a number of initiatives that affirm Canada ' s commitment to Japan and the Asia - Pacific as key to our future success as a trading nation . 
we share a Pacific coast with a diverse and dynamic series or set of countries that happen to be home to most of the world ' s peoples and responsible for an increasing share of the world ' s economic activity . 
in 1997 , Canada hosted the Asia - Pacific Parliamentary Forum in January and the APEC conference in November - December . 
team Canada made a successful visit to the region . 
these and other important exchanges have served us well and will continue to serve us well . 
Japan is not as affected as a number of the countries due to its $ 100 billion trade surplus and $ 200 billion currency reserve , but even Japan ' s economy can be profoundly affected by what is happening in that region . 
in recent meetings of the Asia - Pacific Parliamentary Forum , we learned of the Thai people , who are subject to IMF scrutiny at the present time , having gone through three revisions of their budget in recent months . 
they complain that program spending has produced a downward spiral in terms of their economy and economic activity , and this is typical of the problems occurring in that area . 
it is also important for us to understand the impact of this crisis because it is not within the range of the normal experiences we have observed in that region or anywhere since the Depression . 
if the region attempts to export its way out of the problem , it will have a profound effect on the economies into which they are exporting and the job creation there . 
in fact , the United States has said they will not accept countries in this crisis exporting principally into the United States to solve their problems . 
i will close with a quote that I think indicates the way in which the crisis will have to be met . 
Mr. Koppel writes : 
it is clear that Asia ' s substantial economic gains have been squeezed from minimal structural change . 
this refers to the great success some countries have had with very high year - over - year increases in GDP or a high growth rate . 
the article goes on to state : 
the region ' s leaders must now invest in the human resources and infrastructure needed to improve productivity across the entire economy , particularly in the agricultural and service sectors that employ 85 per cent of the work force . 
as the experience of Japan , Korea , and Taiwan suggests , increased agricultural productivity and consumption lay the foundation for a successful industrial growth strategy , since productive rural households have more cash to purchase agricultural equipment , invest in their children ' s education , and purchase consumer goods . 
the result is sustainable growth driven not only by exports , but by healthy , domestic demand . 
creating that healthy , domestic demand is a very significant and serious challenge for many of those countries . 
having been there in my role as Chairman of Canada - Japan Inter - Parliamentary Association and the Asia - Pacific Parliamentary Forum , I sincerely believe that they are up to the challenge . 
the time - frames within which that will be met , however , are not clear . 
i repeat , it is of absolute importance that we understand , as best we can , what will happen . 
i read that the world ' s growth , which was predicted to have been around 4 per cent , will probably turn out to be 2.5 per cent given the Asian crisis , and perhaps even less than that , depending upon the extent to which Latin American economies are affected by the crisis . 
i note that the Standing Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs will hold follow - up hearings shortly on an interim report tabled by that committee on the Asia - Pacific region and its importance to us . 
i am encouraged by that and also by the interest of colleagues in this chamber in Canada and Japan , as well as our relationship with the region in general . 
hon. Lowell Murray : 
honourable senators , in rising to speak to this report , allow me to thank Senator Hays for the leadership he has given to the Canada - Japan Interparliamentary Group as its Chairman since 1994 . Senator Hays has followed political and economic developments in Japan closely . 
he has stayed in touch with our friends in the Japanese Parliament , and they with him . 
the federal government has wisely taken advantage of Senator Hays ' knowledge and contacts in Japan , and has sought his assistance and cooperation in canvassing interest and support among Japanese legislators on such matters as the Asia - Pacific Conference , the Land Mines Treaty and the Kyoto Conference on the Environment . 
senator Hays succeeded another of our colleagues , Senator Oliver , as chairman of the Canada - Japan group . 
senator Oliver continues to take a close interest in what is happening in Japan and in our relationship with Japan . 
their success as chairmen demonstrates , among other things , the valuable continuity that comes from having a senator at the head of an interparliamentary group such as this one . 
i have no doubt that one day our friends in the House of Commons will insist that it is their turn to be chairman . 
it occurs to me that since Japan , like Canada , has a bicameral Parliament , we might consider providing for that day by having co - chairs , one from the Senate and one from the House of Commons , as is done with the Canada - U.S. parliamentary group . 
it is important that we maintain and , if possible , increase our contacts with Japanese parliamentarians and political figures . 
Japan must undertake extensive economic , financial and administrative changes . 
the social and - in the large sense of the word - cultural implications must be daunting . 
in the past few years , the political scene has been more turbulent than at any time in the post - war history of that country . 
since we were there in November , the largest opposition party , the New Frontier Party , which was itself in part a breakaway offshoot of the governing Liberal Democrats , seems to have unravelled . 
this is only the most recent example of what might be called political restructuring . 
while Japanese politics has always been marked by factionalism and conflict of strong personalities , I do believe that the present and recent upheavals reflect also the difficult dilemmas that confront politicians in that country by reason of the financial and economic predicament in which it finds itself . 
the most obvious of those dilemmas , and the one which must cut very deeply at the level of Japanese voters and their elected representatives , is whether the national , political , social and economic fabric can stand the abandonment of the no - layoff practice that is the result of a lifetime employment tradition in Japanese companies . 
Japanese unemployment , now at 3 per cent , is described as being at record highs . 
the response of the Japanese political leadership , as well as of its political and corporate leadership , to this and many other pressing and urgent questions of restructuring will have an important impact on the Japanese economy and , therefore , on the world economy . 
Canadian parliamentarians do well to keep in touch with them . 
Japan is , after all , as Senator Hays has pointed out , the second biggest economy in the world . 
as it happens , it is Canada ' s second largest trading partner . 
while the volume of our trade , at $ 22 billion annually , does not even approach the size of our trade with the United States , it is still significant , and quite important in some regions of our country . 
sawmills are closing in British Columbia , for example , because of soft demand for lumber in Japan . 
the economic and financial crisis in southeast Asia could not have come at a worse time for Japan . 
the so - called " Asian ` flu " seems to have begun in Thailand and , as happens with such a virus , it exposed and worsened economic and financial weaknesses in southeast Asia and then South Korea . 
the timing was terrible for Japan because the Japanese domestic economy was already flat . 
fiscal stimulus , urged by many , was problematic because government deficits were already considered too high . 
Japan had still not absorbed all the repercussions of the spectacular speculative boom of the 1980 s , the so - called " bubble " which sent real estate and other values soaring and then plummeting . 
it left the financial sector , among others , badly shaken . 
it must be noted , as the Governor of the Bank of Canada has done in a recent speech , that Japan does have the financial capacity to cope with its banking problems , and measures to address these problems and to boost economic recovery have been taken . 
our interest in the success of our Japanese political friends in dealing with these problems is obvious . 
the problems in their domestic economy , and the more serious weaknesses in some other Asian economies , seem to feed on each other . 
the impact of all this on the world economy and on commodity prices for nickel and copper , for example , have a negative impact on such companies as Inco and Noranda . 
i saw a press report recently to the effect that Seagram ' s had suffered a 50 per cent fall in sales of liquor to Asia because of the region ' s currency and economic troubles . 
beyond the economics , and inevitably affected by it , are the questions touching on Japan ' s growing but special role in regional and world security and international development issues . 
the months and years ahead in Japan will be truly challenging for that country ' s political , bureaucratic and business leadership , and for the population as a whole . 
i made my first visit to Japan more than 30 years ago as a tourist , and I have been back there over the years at periodic intervals on government or parliamentary business . 
this was my third meeting in as many years as a member of the Canadian parliamentary delegation . 
i came away , as I believe did all our Canadian colleague , and as Senator Hays said , confident that Japan will come through the looming challenges stronger than ever . 
the opportunities that were provided to us , through the excellent work of the Canadian Embassy in Tokyo , to meet with Japanese business people and with Canadians doing business in Japan was extremely valuable to us in improving our understanding of the Japanese scene and of the nature of our commercial and political relationship . 
the attendance of Japanese parliamentarians was more numerous , and their participation more active and over a broader agenda than at any previous meeting I have attended . 
the Canada - Japan Interparliamentary Group is one which I would strongly recommend to our colleagues in this chamber and in the House of Commons . 
it is very much in our national interest that we maintain the closest and most active relationship with our counterparts in Japan . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
if no other honourable senators wishes to speak , this inquiry is considered debated . 
Iraq 
canada ' s Policy in Current Crisis - Inquiry - Debate Adjourned 
hon. Jerahmiel S . Grafstein rose pursuant to notice of February 12 , 1998 : 
that he will call the attention of the Senate to Canada ' s policy respecting the Iraq crisis . 
those debates project interesting snapshots of Canada ' s history on the run . 
with rare exception , the debate last week in the other place lacked facts and , therefore , clarity , cohesion or context respecting Canada ' s aims , objectives or options . 
above all , we are missing current facts and the invaluable trail of facts that led from Iraq ' s unconditional agreement to unlimited UN inspection as a precondition to cessation of hostilities in 1991 , to the present impasse . 
by comparison , honourable senators , I recently read Churchill ' s war speeches given in the Parliament at Westminster in camera during World War II. 
they serve as models of perception and precision . 
honourable senators , what should be Canada ' s preconditions to war engagement at this time ? 
our policy appears to me to be more opaque than pellucid , even more so than before . 
let me raise a number of questions that I hoped would have been addressed more cogently by all parties in the other place . 
first , what are Canada ' s primary war aims ? 
are the American war aims the same ? 
if they differ , how and why ? 
second , what are Canada ' s precise political and geopolitical objectives respecting the United Nations and that region ? 
what of the other aberrant , adjacent nations in the region ? 
third , what are Canada ' s terms of engagement and the nature of the command structure under which Canadians may be placed in harm ' s way ? 
in Canada ' s post - military era , as Richard Gwyn so aptly put it the other day , are Canada ' s defence forces appropriately organized to efficiently and effectively respond to such a crisis ? 
fourth , what principles of international law govern Canada ' s participation in this engagement ? 
honourable senators , what is the precise role of the UN in the current situation with respect to the command structure and diplomatic actions ? 
fifth , what specific UN resolutions have been breached , and why has it taken the UN or the UN coalition so long to hold Iraq to account ? 
sixth , what are the consequences for peace and security in the region if the primary war aims of the United States are achieved ? 
seventh , what happened to the sanctions option heralded by some in this chamber and the other place in 1991 as an alternative to the Gulf War ? 
if they failed , why and when ? 
are there any sanction alternatives left ? 
eighth , if Iraq , as a condition of cessation of hostilities in the Gulf War agreed to open arms inspection , who is responsible for the delay in enforcing the inspection process since 1991 and why ? 
ninth , what happened to the Hague War Crimes Tribunal initiative for war crimes against humanity against the leadership and the specifically named members of the leadership cadre in Iraq , as a prophylactic against egregious or abhorrent individual conduct since 1993 , when that tribunal was re - established ? 
tenth , what happened to countries whose exports provided - and may still be providing - military weapons or elements necessary to build or rebuild Iraq ' s chemical war arsenal and their military delivery systems ? 
those countries were listed and named in 1991 , and included major members of the Gulf coalition such as Britain , France and Germany , and non - members of the coalition such as China . 
what has happened since ? 
eleventh , what steps are being taken , or will be taken , to limit the impact on innocent civilian populations in Iraq and its adjacent neighbours from chemically poisoned emissions by the proposed bomb strikes ? 
twelfth , what happened to the initial steps taken by the free world after the Gulf War to build an anti - authoritarian , democratic coalition within and without Iraq to provide a political alternative to the people of Iraq ? 
honourable senators , I raise these questions in order to provide - at least for myself - a clearer framework within which to consider Canada ' s role in the Iraq crisis . 
it is clear that Iraq has obviously breached its international obligations . 
it is clear that Iraq is in breach of UN resolutions . 
it is equally clear , however , that there are serious reservations within the Security Council and beyond , within the Gulf coalition and with adjacent neighbouring states who were part of the original Gulf coalition , and who are not yet prepared to support America ' s war aims . 
some say adjacent Arab states are unwilling because they are still considered to be in harm ' s way , and threatened , since the Gulf War mission was not satisfactorily completed . 
what of Russia and its substantial outstanding debt with Iraq , its trade links and desire to regain influence in that region ? 
what of France , its trade links and its equal desire to gain influence in this region ? 
what of China , in its continuing efforts to be a supplier in the arms trade with Iraq ? 
honourable senators , what did happen last September 23 in the United Nations when China , Russia and France threatened to use their vetoes in the Security Council against modest United Nations sanctions to prohibit international air travel by certain Iraq officials ? 
there is no doubt in my mind that the failure to approve these most modest sanctions sent a signal to Hussein that the Gulf coalition was weakening and losing its political will . 
it encouraged him to intensify his challenge to the work of the UN inspection team . 
serious questions , honourable senators , but little or no facts . 
in future , Canada will be approached from time to time to support military intervention . 
what are - or should be - the guidelines and principles set out in advance as benchmarks of action for both parliamentarians and the Canadian public ? 
it seems to me that we are faced with a crisis in Iraq because of the failure of political will to deal appropriately with the threat that Saddam Hussein and his leadership cadre has posed to his neighbours and to the stability and peace of the region since 1991 , when he suffered his weakest moments . 
that threat continued unabated , and indeed grew , after the Gulf War in that region and elsewhere . 
will that situation pertain if America ' s war aims are achieved ? 
before honourable senators offer their views , I would suggest it might be helpful , as I said at the outset , to examine the debates in the Senate on or about November 20 , 1990 . 
many of the arguments which were heard then are still appropriate today . 
i await , and welcome , other senators ' views before I attempt to answer some of these questions myself that I have raised in this inquiry . 
honourable senators , to place this crisis in at least one historical perspective : 
almost 1,600 years ago , St. Augustine , while in North Africa , wrote his enduring classic , City of God , where he contrasted the spiritual gulf between the ideas of Jerusalem and the ideas of Babylon . 
regrettably for Canada and the world , and despite the onslaught of the intervening centuries , that gulf still exists . 
the human condition , honourable senators , remains ever - ready for renovation . 
i eagerly await other senators ' thoughts on Canada ' s policy on this crisis . 
on motion of Senator Kinsella , debate adjourned . 
the Senate adjourned until Wednesday , February 18 , 1998 , at 1:30 p.m.

senators ' STATEMENTS 
Canadian War Museum 
statement on Holocaust Museum - Conformity with Recommendations of Veterans Affairs Subcommittee 
hon. Sharon Carstairs ( Deputy Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , earlier today the Canadian War Museum issued a very significant press release . 
among its statements was that the Holocaust story could best be told in a separate venue , fully dedicated to it . 
the board went on to congratulate the Senate Subcommittee on Veterans Affairs for its helpfulness in developing a public and institutional consensus on this issue . 
they handled the matter with dignity , and with the kind of sober second thought in which all of us in this chamber should take great pride . 
i thank them each individually and as a composite group . 
hon. Duncan J . Jessiman : 
honourable senators , Senator Carstairs has stolen my thunder somewhat . 
i talked with Senator Phillips about an hour ago . 
Ms Adrienne Clarkson , Chairwoman of the Canadian Museum of Civilization Corporation Board of Trustees , announced today that the board has accepted the recommendation of its Canadian War Museum Advisory Committee to proceed with the expansion of the War Museum with all possible urgency . 
the space made available in an expanded War Museum will be required to tell the story of Canada ' s military past . 
the Holocaust story can best be told in a separated venue fully dedicated to it . 
the Corporation will assist in the exploration of an alternative site for the eventual development of a stand - alone and independent Holocaust Museum . 
the Canadian Museum of Civilization Corporation will continue to support the development of a Holocaust Museum . 
the Board also accepted the recommendations of the War Museum Advisory Committee , chaired by the Honourable Barney Danson , to increase the Committee ' s membership to include representatives of the Royal Canadian Legion , the National Council of Veterans ' Associations , the Friends of the Canadian War Museum , the Departments of National Defence and Veterans ' Affairs Canada . 
in addition , historians Robert Bothwell , Jack Granatstein and Terry Copp will join the committee . 
other members include General Paul Manson , Vice - Chairman of the Committee ; Lt . General Charles Balzile ; Major General Robert LaRose ; Richard Neilson , noted film documentary producer ; journalist and veteran Douglas Fisher ; veteran Patricia Toner ; educator Claudette Roy ; and business executive Adam Zimmerman . 
the Canadian Museum of Civilization Corporation will be represented by Ms Clarkson , Chairperson ; Dr. George F . MacDonald , President and CEO ; and Joseph Geurts , Chief Operating Officer . 
Dan Glenney , acting Director General of the Canadian War Museum , will act as secretary to the Committee . 
the Board felt that the briefs presented to the recent hearings by the Senate Subcommittee on Veterans ' Affairs were helpful in developing a public and institutional consensus on this issue . 
in addition , the Canadian War Museum Advisory Committee will undertake without delay further consultation with interest groups and individuals on matters relating to the War Museum . 
the Honourable Senator Phillips , of course , as the chairman , did a marvellous job . 
senator Cools , the deputy chair , did an equally good job . 
the other members of the committee were Senator Chalifoux , Senator Forest and myself . 
[ later ] 
hon. Marcel Prud ' homme : 
honourable senators , I thank Senator Carstairs for her statement concerning the work of the Subcommittee on Veterans Affairs . 
paraphrasing Sir Wilfrid Laurier and Sir Winston Churchill , never in the field of human endeavours has so much been done so fast by so few , and it was the Senate that did it . 
the Senate should take pride in the work the subcommittee did under the extraordinary , friendly , efficient and tough leadership of its chairman , Senator Phillips , who unfortunately , as you know , is at the Grace Hospital today . 
he did not miss one meeting . 
senator Carstairs mentioned some of the members who participated , but I would like to mention all of them . 
senator Jessiman was the member for the Conservative Party , and the committee also included the distinguished Senator Forest and Senator Chalifoux from Alberta , and Senator Cools from Ontario . 
we heard 50 witnesses in one week , a week that the Senate was not sitting . 
yes , I had the honour of participating in this committee , although I am still waiting to become a member of a standing committee . 
honourable senators know that I want to be a full member of a committee , and I will fight until I am . 
however , I was there for 50 of the 50 witnesses and did not miss a minute , as was Senator Kelly . 
we were not members of the committee , but we attended every minute of those meetings , including the in camera meetings , because of our interest on behalf of the Senate . 
esteemed colleagues , the Senate has a role to play in this country . 
the sensitivity of the subject was extraordinary , and a resolution of the issues was important for the sanity of Canada . 
Mr. Trudeau told the national Liberal caucus when I was there to always be careful not to pit groups against groups and people against people , and unfortunately that is what was taking place here . 
the Holocaust Gallery can stand on its two feet somewhere else , as everyone now agrees . 
i believe the museum made this decision so rapidly because of the determination of the Senate subcommittee . 
i , too , wish Senator Phillips a speedy recovery . 
we will wait for him to write the final report . 
although I am not a full member , I will be there , of course , like glue , to finish the work . 
olympic Winter Games 
congratulations to Gold Medal Winning Bobsled Team at Nagano , Japan 
hon. Catherine Callbeck : 
honourable senators , I rise in this chamber today to pay tribute to Dave ` Eli ' MacEachern . 
for those of you who are not aware , Mr. MacEachern is a native of Prince Edward Island , and this past weekend he became the proud owner of a shiny new gold medal in the two - man bobsled event at the Winter Olympics in Japan . 
little did he know that 25 years later he would be pushing a bobsled to Olympic Gold half a world away from his island home . 
Dave MacEachern and Pierre Lueders became the first Canadian team ever to capture the two - man event , and it is only the second time in 62 years that a North American bobsled team has garnered the gold . 
honourable senators , all Islanders are extremely proud of Dave MacEachern ' s effort on behalf of his sport , as indeed is Canada as a whole . 
to show that pride , prior to the event a petition with 17,500 names was sent to Dave in Japan to boost his spirits . 
it must have worked , because Mr. MacEachern has become the first Islander to ever bring home the gold . 
Dave , you are a role model and a true champion . 
congratulations ! 
Asian Community in British Columbia 
congratulations on Twenty - Fifth Anniversary of United Chinese Community Enrichment Services Society 
hon. Pat Carney : 
honourable senators , I bring to the attention of the Red Chamber the fact that one week ago today marked the 25 th anniversary of SUCCESS , the United Chinese Community Enrichment Services Society , which performs an outstanding service in integrating Asian Canadians and other visible minorities into our Canadian community . 
success was incorporated in 1973 . 
it started in a church basement , a small group of people meeting under the chairmanship of Maggie Ip , a teacher of Shanghainese origin . 
its mandate is to help immigrants overcome language and cultural barriers to achieve self - reliance so that they may fully contribute to Canada . 
it provides community services to the Chinese community in B.C. ' s lower mainland , including family and youth counselling , employment training , group and community development , settlement services , language training , programs for women , seniors , and youths . 
it is because of SUCCESS that a young Asian youth can learn canoeing in a British Columbia park or a Chinese granny , who is restricted by her language to her home in Vancouver , can receive assistance and help in becoming part of the wider community . 
in 1997 , from that small group meeting in the church basement , SUCCESS served 210,000 clients in 23 languages from 11 locations in the Lower Mainland . 
i have been happy as a former MP and senator to open some of those locations in the appropriate ceremonies . 
it has a small staff under Executive Director Lillian To , and works with thousands of volunteers to conduct its delivery services . 
between 40 to 50 per cent of the agency ' s annual operating budget of $ 5.8 million is raised from the community itself . 
success holds two major fund - raising events a year : the Walk with the Dragon and the gala dinner . 
that dinner was attended by myself and by Senator Ray Perrault , who often twins me at these events . 
it was attended also by the appropriate federal minister , Raymond Chan , Secretary of State for Asia - Pacific , Premier Glen Clark and most of his cabinet , the mayor and many of the councillors of the city of Vancouver . 
regrettably , no Reform MP attended . 
reform is a party which has yet to recognize the contribution that Chinese Canadians are making to our province . 
its program was aired by Television Broadcast ( HK ) Limited , one of the biggest TV enterprises in Asia . 
it involved an extravaganza , with a crew of 60 top artists and stage - 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
i am sorry to interrupt your statement , Senator Carney , but the three - minute period has expired . 
is leave granted to continue , honourable senators ? 
hon. Senators : 
agreed . 
senator Carney : 
it was broadcast to viewers in Hong Kong , China , Singapore , Vancouver , and Toronto . 
since today ' s paper reminds Canadians that 11.2 per cent of Canadians are from visible minorities and that nearly one - third of the population of greater Vancouver of 1.8 million are of Asian origin , I would ask the chamber to join with me in congratulating SUCCESS on its success in helping a community that is remarkably free of racial tension , in no small measure due to its efforts . 
visitors in the Gallery 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , I would like to draw your attention to a distinguished visitor in our gallery . 
before I introduce him , I must give you the background of the situation . 
two relatives were invited to speak on behalf of all . 
honourable senators , I am delighted to call your attention to the presence of Jules Lesage and his wife . 
Mr. Lesage is the son of Jean Lesage , the former premier of Quebec and former minister of the federal government . 
routine PROCEEDINGS 
Canadian Wheat Board Act 
bill to Amend - First Reading 
the Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate that a message had been received from the House of Commons with Bill C - 4 , to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act and to make consequential amendments to other Acts . 
bill read first time . 
the Hon. the Speaker : 
honourable senators , when shall this bill be read the second time ? 
on motion of Senator Carstairs , with leave of the Senate and notwithstanding rule 57 ( 1 ) ( f ) , bill placed on the Orders of the Day for second reading at the next sitting of the Senate . 
question PERIOD 
prime Minister ' s Office 
appointment of Ethics Counsellor Responsible to Parliament - Government Position 
hon. Marjory LeBreton : 
honourable senators , my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate . 
in 1993 , the government made a commitment in Red Book I , chapter 6 , page 95 . 
the chapter was entitled , " Governing with Integrity . " 
the language was very clear : 
in particular , a Liberal government will appoint an independent Ethics Counsellor to advise both public officials and lobbyists in the day - to - day application of the Code of Conduct for Public Officials . 
the Ethics Counsellor will be appointed after consultation with the leaders of all parties in the House of Commons and will report directly to Parliament . 
it is of interest to note that one of the authors of Red Book I was none other than the present Minister of Finance . 
as reported today , we have yet another ruling by - and I quote The Ottawa Citizen : : 
... prime Minister Jean Chr � tien ' s watchdog over Cabinet ethics ... 
this is one of the more accurate descriptions I have seen of the so - called Ethics Counsellor . 
the controversy was blamed on senior Finance Department officials . 
honourable senators , what we have here now , in fact , is a top - down , totally controlled regime operating within the realm of the Prime Minister ' s Office . 
the Prime Minister names the counsellor , sets the rules which he refuses to share with the public , conducts the inquiry in secret , and only lets Parliament and the public in on the coy arrangement once the decision is announced . 
we have seen this time and time again with respect to such ministers as Dupuy and Collenette , and former minister Doug Young who , as we all know , used all kinds of despicable adjectives when speaking of senators on this side , and of people in the lobbying business . 
when will the government make good on its commitment and name an Ethics Counsellor answerable to , and responsible to , Parliament ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
i regret that the honourable senator may be suggesting that Mr. Wilson ' s assessment of this particular situation was not in accordance with what would be regarded as a very careful and accurate examination of what might have been perceived by some as a conflict . 
Mr. Wilson had been appointed to make such an examination . 
he brought forward what is considered by me , by the government and , I am sure , by the vast majority of the public , to be a fair and accurate assessment and conclusion . 
senator LeBreton : 
honourable senators , I make no such suggestion , but how are we to judge if we do not know the rules or procedures , and we are kept ignorant of how all of these decisions are made ? 
i have two supplementary questions . 
at the beginning of this new session of Parliament , did the government live up to its other commitment and consult the leaders of all parties in the House of Commons on this matter ? 
in other words , was there an effort to reaffirm the appointment of Howard Wilson as Ethics Counsellor ? 
senator Graham : 
i am not aware , honourable senators , as to who was consulted , but I shall endeavour to find out . 
senator LeBreton : 
while doing that , could you determine for us who pays Mr. Wilson ' s salary ? 
is it the Privy Council Office or is it some other department or agency of government ? 
senator Graham : 
Yes. 
health 
cancellation of Research Study on Seniors with Osteoporosis - Possibility of Restoration of Funding - Government Position 
hon. Mira Spivak : 
honourable senators , in December 1995 , the former Minister of Health Diane Marleau held a news conference announcing federal funding for a five - year study of osteoporosis through nine centres across the country . 
this disease affects 1.5 million Canadians and costs the health care system some $ 400 million per year . 
funding for this study was provided for in the federal budget and therefore is built into the existing fiscal framework . 
this announcement is an example of how this government is prioritizing its spending to better serve Canadians by making efficient use of their tax dollars . 
is the government committed to seeing this research through to its conclusion ? 
specifically , will the Minister of Finance restore the funding to Health Canada in order to ensure that , indeed , we do make " efficient use of tax dollars " and not throw years of work and $ 3.5 million down the drain , not to mention the harm that the cancellation of this study is causing to seniors who suffer from osteoporosis ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , that is a very valid question . 
i shall attempt to bring forward a more complete answer with respect to osteoporosis , which is of concern to many Canadians , and to determine whether the particular fund to which my honourable friends refers will be restored . 
senator Spivak : 
as a comment , I hope that the Leader of the Government , who has tremendous influence , would use his advocacy to ensure that this funding is a part of the federal budget which is to be laid before Parliament next week . 
we look forward to seeing that item included . 
senator Graham : 
i will do my best to influence every part of the budget that will be brought down next Tuesday . 
human Rights 
refusal of Prime Minister to Meet with Chinese Human Rights Leader During Recent Visit - Support for United Nations Resolution on Human Rights - Government Position 
hon. No � l A . Kinsella ( Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition ) : 
honourable senators , last Thursday , February 12 , two important visitors to Ottawa made their way to Parliament Hill ; one being Cuban Vice - President Carlos Lage and the other being one of China ' s most prominent political prisoners and human rights activists , Wei Jingsheng . 
as honourable senators may know from media reports , it was only Mr. Lage who was able to meet the Prime Minister . 
Mr. Wei , who was responsible for spearheading the fight for democracy in China , had to settle for a brief meeting with the Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lloyd Axworthy . 
Mr. Wei expressed great concern over Canada ' s apparent disregard for human rights in China , stating that the Chinese people will lose respect for Canada if this federal government continues to act " cowardly " by refusing to stand up to the politicians in Beijing on the issue of human rights . 
he noted that when democracy comes to China , as it inevitably will , the Chinese people will remember whether Canadians stood with them against tyranny . 
would the Leader of the Government in the Senate explain why the Prime Minister refused to meet with this world renowned leader of the human rights struggle for China , and also explain what measures the government has taken to ensure freedom for other political dissidents and prisoners of conscience in China ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , Mr. Wei received a full hearing of his views on China from the government and the Parliament of Canada during his time in Ottawa . 
he met with Minister Axworthy and the Secretary of State for the Asia - Pacific , Mr. Raymond Chan . 
he also spoke before the Standing Committee of the House of Commons on Foreign Affairs and International Trade . 
a central thrust of Canada ' s foreign policy towards China is to promote a greater respect for human rights by both supporting and initiating positive change . 
i know that Honourable Senator Kinsella is a leading advocate of human rights not only in his native New Brunswick but in our country and in other parts of the world . 
in April of 1997 , Minister Axworthy announced a package of human rights initiatives between Canada and China . 
a major component of the package was the establishment of a joint committee on human rights to address our concerns on human rights issues . 
senator Kinsella : 
honourable senators , the Leader of the Government will recall that last year his government did not endorse the resolution of the United Nations condemning China ' s human rights policy . 
could the minister advise the Senate whether or not the government will continue to demonstrate to the world that when it comes to supporting a United Nations resolution condemning human rights violations in China , it will be on side ? 
senator Graham : 
i believe , honourable senators , we are pointing in the right direction because the committee to which I referred has met twice in 1997 . 
they met in Ottawa in July , and they met in October in Beijing . 
these initiatives are clear indications of Canada ' s commitment to promote change through ongoing dialogue with the Chinese government . 
the Economy 
crisis in Health Care Funding - Cuts to Transfer Payments to Provinces - GoVernment Policy 
hon. Duncan J . Jessiman : 
honourable senators , my question is to the Leader of the Government . 
it seems that not a single day passes without a local paper talking about the crisis in the hospitals . 
wherever the region , the situation is systemic and problematic . 
health care is a priority for this government . " 
since 1993 the Liberals have cut the level of cash transfers for health by some $ 6.3 billion . 
since government must be responsible for its actions , what is its plan to resolve this crisis it has created in the area of health care ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , it is fair to say that the reduction in public sector health care expenditures is the result of the overall restructuring of the provincial health care programs designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Canada ' s health care programs . 
the Government of Canada has increased the CHST cash floor to $ 12.5 billion annually , starting in 1997 - 98 . 
this amount is consistent with the recommendations of the National Forum on Health . 
senator Jessiman : 
what the Finance Minister did not say is that in seven of Canada ' s ten provinces , cash transfers would continue to fall over the next five years . 
if health care is a priority for this government , can the leader explain why it is not acting with more haste ? 
senator Graham : 
honourable senators , it is important to note that CHST transfers , including cash , in what are referred to as tax points , now total more than $ 25 billion a year and will rise again in 1998 - 99 . 
a stable , predictable funding plan will result . 
human Resources Development 
availability of Retraining for Unemployed - Incentives Available through Revenue Canada - Government Position 
hon. A . Raynell Andreychuk : 
honourable senators , the government has stated that both health care and education are priorities . 
certainly , the Canadian people have said so very strongly . 
the Prime Minister has also appeared recently on television giving speeches about education and announcing as a priority a fund to overcome impediments to young people in getting post - secondary education . 
however , the government has not attacked the other primary issues confronting Canadians , the lack of employment in Canada and the problems associated with competing internationally ? 
the issues facing Canadians are how to gain and maintain employment , how to get an education and how to compete and trade internationally . 
i am particularly addressing IPSCO , Inc. and the excellent example that the company has set in Western Canada by not only diversifying its trade into other countries , but by taking care to ensure that its employees receive the kinds of skills necessary to compete appropriately in the world . 
only then did IPSCO discover that taking post - secondary education is a taxable benefit in the hands of the employee . 
will the government undertake to ensure that this situation is corrected immediately ? 
will the government also undertake that , in the budget that is to be made public next week , education will receive priority ? 
i am not referring here to just one endowment such as the Millennium Fund , but to true , sensible incentives for retraining built into Revenue Canada ' s programs ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , the honourable senator raises a valid point , and I shall bring that matter to the attention of my colleagues . 
senator Andreychuk : 
has Revenue Canada been instructed by the cabinet or the minister to make this problem a priority and to correct it immediately ? 
senator Graham : 
not to my knowledge , honourable senators , but as I just indicated , I make that undertaking to my honourable friend . 
health 
compensation for Hepatitis C Victims - Increase in Payments to Provinces - Government Position 
hon. Norman K . Atkins : 
honourable senators , my question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate . 
yesterday , Canadian sufferers of hepatitis C received word that federal , provincial and territorial health ministers had failed to agree on how to compensate them for contracting the infection through tainted blood . 
despite the provincial ministers ' failure to reach agreement on this issue , it was indicated that the current carrying costs for victims of hepatitis C , such as medical and social assistance costs , have stretched already waning health budgets . 
the ministers argued that cuts to federal transfer payments for health care greatly contributed to their inability to react in an expedient manner . 
it is estimated that there are roughly 60,000 victims of hepatitis C in Canada . 
can the Leader of the Government in the Senate indicate when and , more important , how the federal government will assume its political and financial responsibilities in resolving the hepatitis C compensation issue ? 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , I thank the honourable senator for his question because that subject is certainly of concern to Canadians in every province , and most particularly to those who have been infected . 
very careful attention was paid by the federal Minister of Health and by his counterparts in the provinces in preparing for yesterday ' s meetings in Toronto . 
while they did not come to any final agreement , they have agreed to continue to work together to put in place a compensation scheme . 
the Government of Canada , of course , is committed to the successful completion of these discussions , as I am sure all other provincial governments are , and while they did not reach an agreement on a joint package , they indicated that progress was made , and that further discussions would take place . 
senator Atkins : 
could the federal government consider increasing the block payments it makes to the provinces , in order to help them compensate some of these victims who will need a great deal of financial help ? 
senator Graham : 
the Government of Canada is committed to helping those who have been affected under such tragic circumstances . 
that is a commitment . 
labour 
review of Canada Post Corporation - Request for Progress Report 
hon. Brenda M. Robertson : 
my question concerns a top - to - bottom review of Canada Post which might result in ways to avoid future postal interruptions . 
during the consideration of the Postal Services Continuation Bill , Bill C - 24 , in Committee of the Whole , this chamber received assurances that outside management consultants and experts in industrial relations would be brought in to Canada Post to study it from top to bottom so that ways could be found to solve its problems . 
will the Leader of the Government in the Senate make representations to the Minister of Labour regarding the urgent need to conduct this review as quickly as possible so that management and workers of the fourth - largest corporation in the country will never again be able to treat the Canadian public and the small business community as hostages ? 
while he is at it , could the minister also provide a report on any progress made to date in solving the many problems in the Post Office ? 
many employees in the postal services have concerns about processes that will be in place until the next bargaining round . 
hon. B . Alasdair Graham ( Leader of the Government ) : 
honourable senators , I would be very happy to do so . 
as usual , the Honourable Senator Robertson has brought forth a very timely reminder of commitments that were made , and I shall consult with the appropriate minister - and indeed with the proper official in the postal department - in attempting to bring forward an answer as soon as possible .

orders OF THE DAY 
telecommunications Act 
Teleglobe Canada Reorganization and Divestiture Act 
bill to Amend - Second Reading - Debate Continued 
on the Order : 
resuming debate on the motion of the Honourable Senator Poulin , seconded by the Honourable Senator Losier - Cool , for the second reading of Bill C - 17 , to amend the Telecommunications Act and the Teleglobe Canada Reorganization and Divestiture Act . 
hon. William M. Kelly : 
honourable senators , I am pleased today to speak to Bill C - 17 . 
in 1984 , I was honoured to co - chair a task force on Crown corporations . 
this was part of the transition exercise as we moved from the Liberal administration to the Progressive Conservative government . 
our group was given two tasks : 
as you know , Teleglobe was , in fact , privatized in 1987 . 
another very closely related subject that I would like to raise relates to the implications of this bill for competition in domestic telecommunications and , in particular , competition in the local telecommunication market . 
the bill has been positioned by Senator Poulin as a step towards introducing competition in international telecommunications and , as necessary , to implementing Canada ' s obligations under the World Trade Organization . 
these are laudable objectives , and ones which I am sure everyone in this chamber supports . 
over the past decade we have seen the benefits of competition in domestic telecommunications . 
rates have fallen and services have expanded . 
this has been to the substantial benefit of business and individual consumers . 
i think it is fair to say , however , that domestic competition originated in the market - and indeed was forced on to us by the market . 
at first one , and then a few other small pioneers decided to challenge the monopoly telephone companies and were ultimately successful . 
government policy , in fact , followed the market ; it did not lead the market . 
i fully acknowledge that there was a Progressive Conservative government in power at that time , but I fear that we may be following the same course in international telecommunications . 
if I may digress here for a moment , it was the Standing Senate Committee on Transport and Communications , chaired by my colleague Senator Oliver , in its pre - study of the Telecommunications Act , that was instrumental in developing a legislative framework for competition and choice in telecommunications . 
this is the type of very important work that the Senate does , but for which it rarely gets credit . 
however , to return to my point , I am concerned that Bill C - 17 may be a little behind the times in terms of the liberalization of international telecommunications that is now upon us . 
that liberalization is due to market forces and the General Agreement on Trade in Services , or GATS , on basic telecommunications , to which Canada is a signatory and to which Senator Poulin referred at length in her remarks yesterday . 
in July 1995 , the government announced a policy review of Teleglobe and of international telecommunications . 
no results of that review have ever been released . 
instead , the government has issued the occasional press release , or letter , and engaged in incremental actions . 
if the government has a policy framework for the regulation of international telecommunications , it has not been enunciated . 
with all respect to Senator Poulin and her colleagues , it is very difficult to evaluate this bill because we do not know for what purposes or to what end it will be used to regulate or advance Canada ' s interests in international telecommunications . 
let me turn now to Teleglobe . 
as you know , Teleglobe was set up in 1948 as a Crown corporation in order to implement Canada ' s obligations under the Commonwealth Telecommunications Agreement . 
during its entire existence , Teleglobe has been treated as a chosen instrument of the Government of Canada in overseas telecommunications . 
by way of a " gentleman ' s agreement " - and I am not being sexist , because that is what it was called - Teleglobe was assured of a monopoly in routing oversees telecommunications traffic . 
that monopoly began in 1948 when Teleglobe bought out Marconi ' s interest in Canada , and persists largely today intact , even after privatization . 
the monopoly and chosen instrument status were probably quite proper and understandable when Teleglobe was a Crown corporation , but Teleglobe ' s monopoly was extended for another five years after the company was privatized . 
i might note here parenthetically that Stentor has reached an agreement with Teleglobe that assures Teleglobe of 75 per cent of its traffic for two years after the so - called " end of the monopoly . " 
the reason the government gave for the monopoly extensions was to give Teleglobe time to prepare for competition . 
i believe it is fair to say that Teleglobe is no more competitive today , nor prepared for competition , than it was in 1987 . 
what has been accomplished during three monopoly extensions has been the delay of competition in overseas telecommunications , a very happy circumstance for the shareholders , and I do not fault shareholders being rewarded . 
Teleglobe ' s charges are substantially higher than for long - distance calls of equivalent length over the North American telecommunications grid , where competition and choice exist , or for overseas telecommunication calls that are routed via the United States , where competition and choice also exist . 
if you want proof of this statement , you need look no further than a Financial Post article dated January 7 , 1998 . In that article , a senior officer of Teleglobe announced that Teleglobe would drop its tariffs by more than 12 per cent in order to respond to the competition that Teleglobe anticipates will result from the CRTC ' s decision on December 19 last year pertaining to " international switched hubbing . " 
i will return to that decision in just a moment . 
in the U.S. , Teleglobe has been allowed to penetrate the three market segments of carriers , businesses and individual consumers . 
earlier this month , Teleglobe USA Inc. was granted approval by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission to route U.S. calls to Canada through its own network , rather than through circuits leased from U.S. carriers . 
Teleglobe ' s monopoly allows no such competition to Teleglobe in Canada , and Teleglobe has opposed liberalized regulation in Canada assiduously . 
it has , for example , appealed to the CRTC to ban what is called " international switched hubbing , " or ISH , as it is referred to . 
Teleglobe itself does ISH . 
what Teleglobe objects to is when someone leases circuits from Teleglobe and then routes their own customers ' traffic over these circuits . 
ISH is directly analogous to what the pioneers of resale did domestically that ultimately broke up the monopoly in domestic long distance . 
if Teleglobe succeeds in having ISH banned , it will put Canadian - owned companies engaged in this activity out of business . 
Teleglobe was initially successful in convincing the CRTC to ban international switch hubbing , or ISH , although on December 19 last year the CRTC reversed itself and decided to allow it . 
on February 2 , Teleglobe appealed to the CRTC to stay that decision and , at the same time , appealed to the cabinet to rescind or vary the decision or send it back to the CRTC for reconsideration . 
in its petition to the CRTC , Teleglobe asked the CRTC to preserve " Teleglobe ' s status and exclusive mandate . " 
Teleglobe ' s objective appears clear - to preserve its monopoly and postpone competition in overseas telecommunications as long as possible . 
honourable senators , I do not believe that firms need to have monopoly powers in Canada in order to compete abroad . 
i believe they should learn to compete in Canada first . 
i do not believe that Canadian consumers should be required to subsidize Canadian firms for foreign ventures , especially if Canadian consumers are deprived of the benefits of competition and choice that those firms ' foreign consumers have . 
i do not believe we are doing Teleglobe any favours by delaying the judgment day of competition . 
my point in reciting all this background relates to proposed section 16.1 ( 1 ) of Bill C - 17 . 
that section requires a licence from the CRTC for anyone who wishes to provide international telecommunications services . 
i should like to understand why the government feels this proposed section is necessary , and to what end the licensing authority will be used . 
what I fear , and what I would be opposed to , is that the proposed section could be used , or is intended to be used , to continue Teleglobe ' s privileged position . 
this could happen by using the powers of proposed section 16.1 ( 1 ) to limit or delay competition to Teleglobe either by facilities - based carriers or by resellers . 
the other issue I should like to raise also relates to proposed section 16.1 ( 1 ) and to the goals of competition and choice . 
once again , a little history is required . 
in 1994 , the CRTC concluded that increased competition and local telecommunications would be in the public interest . 
in May of last year , the CRTC issued another decision to establish the framework for that competition . 
the May CRTC decision , however , restricted entry into the local market solely to facilities - based carriers - that is , carriers that own fibre optic cable or other transmission facilities . 
under the Telecommunication Act , a facilities - based carrier must be able to meet certain specified Canadian ownership requirements . 
the net effect was that foreign - owned or controlled telecommunication companies were banned from entering the Canadian local telecommunications sector - even those that were already competing as resellers in the Canadian long - distance market or Centrex resell market , and doing so successfully . 
i am advised that this provision could well conflict with our international obligations to open all telecommunications to resale - type competition , in that foreign - owned entities are subject to discrimination relative to Canadian - owned firms . 
we must wonder also if this is the way to ensure the most effective competition in the new telecommunications market and the widest possible choice for consumers in local telecommunications . 
the issue would have been addressed under the proposed section 16.1 ( 1 ) originally tabled in the other place . 
however , proposed section 16.1 ( 1 ) was amended in the other place , restricting its application to providers of international telecommunication services . 
thus , providers of domestic telecommunications services , which includes local telecommunications services , are not covered . 
the reasons for this amendment in the other place had nothing to do with a local competition issue . 
it appears that the amendment was made with some haste and without consideration of its impact on local competition . 
honourable senators , I suggest to you that the Senate should revisit this issue , as the Senate did so constructively in its pre - study of the Telecommunications Act . 
i put it to this chamber that proposed section 16.1 ( 1 ) , as presented to the Senate , begs a number of serious questions that go to the heart of this government ' s policy on telecommunications . 
efficient , low cost telecommunications , both domestic and overseas , are the keys to our productivity , our competitiveness , and our ability to build a solid economy in the 21 st century . 
experience has shown us that competition and choice help to drive cost effective telecommunications . 
under GATS , Canada has agreed to a liberalized regulatory regime for telecommunications . 
i suggest that Bill C - 17 be looked at in that light .
