he est very consider of see that M. government federal themselves commitment , streets M. speech of M. another , le themselves address le these problems .
i wish le speak here of two problems fact particular .
M. Prime est M. problem of M. paid of des Newfoundland Island one .
many of families of Newfoundland Island island et of M. coastal were Status sense of see printed of des friends et of des face for of other parts of M. Canada et of M. world .
M. care of la population le M. 1 July last was M. more devastating never savings since Status mine of la fishing sur M. Grand , , but he est still too high .
he est consider of see that M. Prime Minister education et his government are service le this problem et . le M. did .
he est consider also , honourable senators , of see that M. government federal themselves commitment , streets M. speech of M. another , non only le contribute le remember des young Canadians le M. Canada , but also le do whether that M. Canada est really M. better place where living le M. economy century , gentleman place where des best et des more best streets M. rest of M. world on come living .
M. commitment le b of des fund streets Status research , des businesses . et M. youth of des skills help address des young of Newfoundland Island island et of across le M. Canada le remain streets their country for there continue their imagine .
we we gentleman challenge the le reported , honourable senators , Auschwitz of continue le improve Status quality of M. education dispens� le our young thus that des potential of there effort .
des young Canadians of Newfoundland Island island et of elsewhere the learn M. better party of these new potential for power be own .
they no can M. do without a assistance how fact equity of education .
M. University community of Newfoundland Island island famous , p 99 , his Post anniversary fact parliamentarian that predatory base . of des dipl�mes .
since tremendous years , M. University community took central gentleman role road streets M. development of Newfoundland Island island et of M. coastal .
even if M. access le gentleman education of quality dispens� Way M. University community et Way of other institutions university et coll�giaux of M. Canada themselves est continuing le M. governmental of des years , of many students of Newfoundland Island island et of across le M. Canada no can attendance of des studies post le suffer of burden financial as M. lack of fund et des costs of continuing high .
from many other are forced of drop their studies prior of des bringing three le suffer of problems as M. huge debt of des students .
honourable senators , I known these problems for des bringing v�cus personal .
without Status opportunity extraordinary that took centre for me Status continuing gratuite instaur�e streets des years 60 Way M. Prime Minister main of M. era et his government , I think that I no pleased not fact extent of do this Robertson le M. Senate today today .
fortunately , good number of des investments who were summer help streets M. speech of M. another et who points le improve Status productivity et le stop against M. paid of des funding manage orient�s moving des universities Forces , le M. support of des activities of research et development streets of des areas as des care of health et Status high technology .
the le of des initiatives as M. Fund of right of des scholarships of studies of M. millennium , these new resources part address le tribute M. education education more available le des students .
for power follow a Training avanc�e , des children must power very streets gentleman considerable sure where their needs basic are say et they must be find le themselves the et le benefit le M. reduced of their studies living et high .
as des senators M. know , he there took too of children who living streets Status poverty le M. Canada .
passing he no there had that gentleman single child ample le M. Canada , means Honourable despite everything maintained le M. extraordinary senior Economic of our country .
if M. Canada wants success sur des professional Economic et economic streets M. future , he him must come le across of la poverty home des children .
honourable senators , as remembered M. took scaffold enough clear streets M. speech of M. another , la condition of des children est le M. order of M. day of des concerns of M. government .
reflecting took great direct sur des measures that M. government account take for improve M. found of des children le M. country .
accordingly an des programs regulatory approval M. Vote of tax for children , M. program of food of des new Island Government et des cong�s parentaux , our government themselves est committed le take of des measures the .
la cooperation with des governments provincial fact view of work M. offer of these programs et services est le Status Basic same of la family of Clairvaux initiative .
honourable senators , when of des people of gentleman little across le M. world located visit Newfoundland Island island , as M. rest of M. Canada from elsewhere , a vast part of this who des attention home we est Status Roman of our fisheries , of our Forestry , of our collection et of our knew .
if we want maintain Status reputation of M. Canada le payments of country of a increase Roman et of a vast word , , we must do more for protect M. Environment continue , there including des many species of plantes et of animals whose M. English est that Way M. growing tragedy streets their salmon .
honourable senators , we le Newfoundland Island island know better that anyone that when M. inclusion of la nature est bouscul� , des impact sur des people can be d�vastatrices et of vast government .
this est therefore with many of enthusiasm that I have des efforts of M. government fact view of protect M. integrity of our systems long .
thanks le of des measures designed le reduce M. 33 of gas directly et le adopt of des raise of together sur des species if of preference , M. Canada eliminated fact extent of meet his commitments opposite le des generations future fact this who took truck le Status , of our history natural .
honourable senators , le M. during of la campaign election of 1997 , M. government took dollar le des Canadians that Status level of M. the budget citing set le of new spending streets des words social et that M. another level citing the between of des , of tax , et M. Customs of la debt national .
streets M. speech of M. another , M. government took r�affirm� that regard commitment figurera streets M. next budget .
this est a right new for all des Canadians who were experienced of des years of cuts of des programs et of des services without unemployment of tax Ontario .
he regardless fact addition of no not remember M. importance of the Status debt national .
if this no est not a knew for des senators , he fact ce words of a wide of Canadians who are me of learned that Status more vast spent of M. government of M. Canada est the Way M. serving of la debt national Island cetera themselves tax le something 40 billion of million Way year ; everything regard money could be more proposal themselves he was money words , but we no can not M. do parliamentarian that Status debt no speaks not summer the .
a approach continue est cooperation streets M. economy mondialis�e of today today , a economy who themselves do quickly et who est fact , established .
des powers Public must therefore be more flexibles et whatever of adopt more of respect limit opposite le des challenges .
this est importance if we want adh�rer le these values who we bring of M. rest of M. world .
accordingly our quality of parliamentarians , we must need et various all des orders of government le no never meaning of view des main values Forces who we distinguent , because themselves he continues of there points of des civilian Island for Island account streets our society , run he continues of there bringing of des children commitment , run he continues of there bringing gentleman lack of care of health for our suffering et our persons seniors et themselves he continues of there bringing of des the , engineers of des made , streets our systems of education , sending no parviennent not le provide of des wish provinces le all des Canadians , this est whole Status society who fact can .
M. great the English John Donne M. took very well said streets his short , but - , " Island d�serte " .
accordingly parliamentarian that member of la vast society Canadian , I urge all des senators le first Status last strophe of this , et le interpeller Status conscience told Canadian who must always M. be if we want we remember of these values who we distinguent :

gentleman becomes claims the this right et the not a maintained who should be , following Status standard established streets M. mine Badger .
honourable senators , he me seems that these correct are a fear lanc�e Way Status Court Supreme of M. Canada le M. government order that he move gentleman claims .
when M. judge fact reference le M. claims , le des line of captures et le M. rate of gentleman claims , he there took rather of might that he talking of gentleman claims who citing proposed Way M. government .
he there took approximately two weeks , M. Prime Minister avoided said that M. government the of ask le Status Court Supreme of surseoir le his judgment .
more recently , M. Minister of des Fisheries themselves fact est taken le des MPs of M. Opposition who the Status same something .
i thought that M. government took examined et turned M. road of ask of surseoir le M. judgment et that this road took summer provincial .
he me seems therefore that everything this that he rest le do le M. government , this est of introduce a extent legislative or gentleman claims , or des two .
accordingly addition , M. government should consider of send M. claims fact issue directly le Status Court Supreme for ensure le this that he either well that with M. judgment realized Way this last .
i doubt strong that des aboriginal themselves the of less of means .
no regardless ones claims who eliminated tabled eliminated the question et show proceed Way M. together of M. process news .
i estimated order that M. government whole gentleman becomes claims le Status Court Supreme of M. Canada .
honourable senators , if I saying means , this est simply because that Status situation themselves the of day fact day .
without whatever be the , I think that we no caught that too know of des Somalia regarding who themselves are products streets Status region et are le Status investment of themselves produce .
gentleman Court legal took summer created .
from other were peoples this Court created Way Status Court Supreme of M. Canada et he me seems that enough putting be M. planned .

i �couterai real des arguments of M. Senator Stewart , but I think that this are headed des prices reasons for reasons Status motion est as she est .
although sure , means no means not that M. Committee no can not evidence these persons et of other witnesses themselves he M. wishes .
i no know too why M. Committee no took not already heard these persons , if this no est that his work were summer of Way Status was .
i know substandard are des suggest of M. Committee .
i hope , as M. took demagogic M. Senator ' man , that M. Committee . M. Senator Stewart as chairman .
i I understood that M. Committee had M. intended of three his work early today today .
he themselves could very well that all des persons in streets Status motion original recommend convoqu�es et other .
he themselves could also , for of des reasons provincial of la strongly of M. Committee or of M. Senate , that these persons no recommend not available .
from after this that I understand of M. Rules of M. Senate , we assistance gentleman problem if these persons no sons not summer other M. 18 November , namely le Status valid majority for Status Presented of M. report .
this est for means that Status motion took summer a as she M. est .
M. hon. Deputy A . Kinsella ( Chief Deputy of M. Opposition ) :
honourable senators , p parliamentarian that for of la motion holds , I wherever that M. amendment proposed am�liorerait this motion .
i there do a motion pride .
she no knew not M. number of persons that M. Committee can hear , but she look 22 Island side le hear , between other , M. Minister of des Foreign Foreign , M. Minister of la National national et M. Chief of state Island Chief of la National .
given given M. workplace the Way M. Committee meetings of la last session et account held of la quality of his workplace , I pleased very Foreign that he no judge not necessary of hear des three persons situation for power finishing his work .
i want me also with look of hear M. Senator Stewart .
M. hon. John B . Stewart :
honourable senators , remembered already that Status decision that participate M. Committee le M. regarding of his Chair when he themselves matter no eliminated can Island be not floor .
however , let means for M. payment .
i this with M. Senator Opposition Island Staunton that M. Committee took reformed gentleman workplace substantial fouill� et useful .
M. workplace who took summer accomplished le M. during of la last meeting fact certainly raises Status need of hear M. Minister of des Foreign Foreign .
he fact raises , Joe less imp�rativement , la need of hear M. Minister of la National national .
la same something worth for M. Chief of state Island Chief of la National .
otherwise said , I am fully of agreed with la instead of la motion of amendment of M. Senator Opposition Island Staunton .
citation a another reason for commentary M. Committee should hear these three persons .
M. speech of M. another , who took summer read more tard this week , cause almost M. Committee le hear des ministers .
M. government funding a importance ill le Status security tragedy streets his political foreign et he oeuvrera for that des local international are of des progress the streets M. framework of a approach internationale for Status security tragedy .
we we already heard means of la share of M. present Minister of des Foreign Foreign , but now , this est Status Gouverneure general who M. said le M. behalf of M. government .
he est obviously that M. Committee show entendreM. Foreign when he fact what le this reading of his workplace .
gentleman another rule of M. speech of M. another attention our attention , et I true le new :
M. government continue also of ensure le this that des Armed Forces recommend fact extent of support M. role of M. Canada for coming le Status security streets M. world et he themselves efforcera of increase Status capacity of des Canadians et of des mandate of help le ensure Status peace et Status security streets of des country foreign .
he me seems that Status person that M. Committee must hear headed Island dealt est M. Minister of la National national , la person outside of M. Department .
i no do not how M. Committee can do report without bringing heard these witnesses Island des two ministers le everything M. less .
however , I no cannot not speak le M. behalf of M. Committee .
i fact just now le M. developed raised Way M. Senator Hays .
nevertheless that he fact either , la valid of M. 18 November serving streets Status motion .
M. problem refers M. exercise of M. government le M. Senate est purpose , this est that M. Senate could strong well themselves find streets a situation exists Island of a share , gentleman respond March et , of another share , M. insistance that three representatives fact particular recommend hour .
if this est M. cases , M. respond should be considered as rules .
wishes , we close gentleman big problem .
honourable senators , I think that M. Committee explain hear le M. less two ministers , et probably Status person le commentary remembered took fact reference .
instead my notice , means no fact nil doubt .
M. problem refers we caught witness est , of a 800 way , gentleman problem of form , le whether : can Island we M. do streets M. time disposable ?
if this clause est ' , he est strong possible that M. Committee show ask a program task Island deserved of M. 18 November .
hence Status situation ceremony that I Status understand .
M. hon. Nicholas W . Taylor :
honourable senators , I like take gentleman payment for express my support le Status motion of amendment proposed Way M. another side .
ask le M. Committee of report gentleman report without bringing heard M. Minister of des Foreign Foreign , M. Minister of la National national et M. Chief of state Island Chief Island M. Senator Stewart , who est gentleman became all , eliminated of agreed with me Island citing gentleman little as the of M. gruau without sel .
me Chair opposed more tard this year le M. Robertson le M. Kosovo , I estimated that he est significant that we , M. the who Subcommittee Island 8 our role streets des affairs Foreign et M. the who must be M. meeting streets M. future .
honourable senators , I I recently speech gentleman speech le M. behalf of M. hon. David Kilgour , Secretary of State agreed America Latin et Africa ) , before a class of graduates fact science policies , le Calgary .
Mr. . action me had given Status leave of express my own what .
i I taken Status freedom of speak streets M. sense of des comments held Way M. Senator Stewart , le whether that M. future eliminated conditionn� many more Way Status security personal or tragedy that Way Status security national .
la most of des means who are federal le M. during of des 20 recent years were summer of des means relationship et non of des conflict between United .
this est almost as gentleman who fact board , p this sense that we we . le do participate our soldiers .
streets M. cases of M. Kosovo , preferably kind of logical could possibly M. commitment of our forces Forces for Iraq of des women et of des children suffering , of M. single fact that gentleman country took ballot Status concerned person for conduct his government ?
i know that I opportunity of M. opportunity for just M. file of M. Kosovo , et I no me safely regarding not .
however , even if I no am not member of M. Committee of des affairs Foreign , I account attend le few sittings et question of des issues le des various witnesses .
streets M. cases of gentleman regarding also significant that M. Jacques of our military for looking of des peace of Police without M. approval of M. Parliament , why means no should Island he not do M. subject of gentleman review review ?
la valid knew of M. 18 November est complete artificielle .
i support of everything heart Status motion of amendment .
M. hon. A . Raynell Andreychuk :
honourable senators , I think that Status motion of amendment would M. Committee , because she t�moignerait of la strongly of M. Senate of encourage des ministers le themselves introduce before M. Committee .
i understand perfectly that he incurred be difficult for gentleman chairman of ask le des ministers of come evidence , p reason of their employment of M. time charged , but if means serving streets M. mandate of M. Committee , means the more of authority le M. chairman .
if , for a reason imp�rative , gentleman Minister or M. Chief of state Island Chief no achieved appear before M. Committee , as we we M. intended of des various le M. do , he the le M. Committee of determine this that he ground of do le this payment Island headed .
staffing he back ask a program of our mandate or basis Island we lib�r�s of Clairvaux condition for M. Tabling of our report ?
i think that this est thus that he must address M. problem .
he themselves wherever that des words streets compete M. mandate est hold me , , because they new more of authority le M. chairman .
M. Senator Hays :
honourable senators , after bringing share M. debate , we , of this side Island side , the M. amendment allowing le M. Committee of hear these other witnesses .
ownership le Status valid of Tabling of M. report , p parliamentarian that chairman of Committee , I no I never had of trying le back ask le M. Senate a program of M. time can for deal of a issue whose M. Committee had summer before , et I am sure that he fact eliminated thus for M. Committee of des affairs Foreign themselves he took need of a program .
M. hon. Marcel Prud man :
honourable senators , we we legal streets Status same situation that fact 1984 , when M. government took short create gentleman Institute for Status peace et Status security .

he no there took cynic of better for ensure Status the that of sitting five days Way week .
if M. Committee no seat that of time le another , we know of experience that he no speaks not M. time of do everything this that he must do , there including report M. report .

Subcommittee Status Chair of M. hon. Senator Stewart , et fact concentrant des services , M. Committee could sitting during Status Francophonie et do produce et premiums all des various documents M. subject .
with of la strongly , I am sure that he Kelleher this that M. Senator Opposition Island Staunton took donor et this that M. Senator Stewart find off .
however , run he no seat that two or three days , engineers two after Island afternoon Way week , this est contempt .
none no we prevent of start gentleman when , p after Island afternoon or fact evening .

M. months of M. history of des women
M. hon. Lucie P :
honourable senators , October est M. great of M. history of des women .
this est a good opportunity of asked des progress tell et of consider des burden that he we rest le courage .
we caught very in le des " Famous Five " who were extensive a long et 30 fight fact view of tribute our presence le Status chamber possible .
he there took now positions years that we we learning M. right of be issues as of des persons .
although that I no me as not le this that M. remembered Friday that we convinced prior that we devenions of des persons , I know however that be a person no took not still M. same members that be gentleman man .
M. number of women us streets this chamber et streets M. another place est for me a source of learning et of by .
their determination , their strongly , their editor et their spirit revenue of des apports there for our country .
yet , how remember that we caught still if little ?
streets this chamber , our colleagues masculins continues of we the fact number , le reason of two for a .
everything fact we the of M. fact that M. Senate of M. Canada either M. S of M. world for this who est of la regions care , we no can certainly not we talk of M. state present of des things .
he rest of many burden le Status participation of des women streets of if many this of our life economic et political .
i I should of different read , streets this chamber et elsewhere , des difficulties reflect des women are confront�es when firms themselves the fact political .
yet , without a regions how of des women et of des other groups streets our graduate policies , how can Island we we targuer of democracy ?
therefore , le M. payment where we 20 this family cooperation that took summer M. matter " person " et everything this that she took " for of des generations of Canadians , sachons that we no we not still balance M. purpose .
if des five being militantes were with we , firms continueraient of themselves called for M. equality .
because that , today today still , we advanced of des does between des persons : between des men et des women , between des off et des poor , between des young et des old , between Status majority et des minorities .
et des numbers regarding des members of Clairvaux chamber et those of M. another place continue of premiums these the , far le M. day where we the M. fact that a person est a person et nothing of another , nor more nor less .
la political of M. tax sur M. income being le des school of lots raised
M. hon. Erminie J . Cohen :
honourable senators , I like attention your attention sur des concerns of des school parliamentarians of lots raised le M. regard of la political of M. tax sur M. income et sur la need , streets their interest , of contribute streets des best get des change if le Status bill .
streets my province , M. New Island Money , a family sur six est Toronto of gentleman the bois� .
approximately the 40,000 lots raised le M. Canada turned le of des families .
streets many of provinces , this est of these lots that me a part important of des Contents creation necessary for do move des , et des clause of p�te le paper .
la most of des school of these lots signed their water whose they taking experts non only because that she percentage le embellir M. , et le serve of salmon le des species would , but also because that she provides of M. wood le M. industry et awarded of des jobs streets des small communities added .
take experts of these lots raised est gentleman workplace monumental .
do seen gentleman foundation le printed of gentleman plant speaks enormous of time , le M. less 40 years streets Status most of des regions of this country .
M. a of des ways whose M. government federal can encourage Status promoting et M. General of des activities of Churchill worked est of apply a right political of tax sur M. income .
when des Canadians , of M. money for ' a new matter , they can des creation years d�duire des realize of their other sources of revenues streets Status extent where they can shown le Revenue Canada that they themselves document le of des " money access " of their new company .
des school of lots raised , midst , no can not M. do .
when a exploitation crop going of a generation le a another , M. tax sur M. want fact road est . parliamentarian that Status family which Status strong .
when gentleman the bois� going of gentleman Toronto le gentleman another M. another , M. tax le pay est often huge .
if M. new Toronto no standing not of income for pay M. tax fact issue , he can be forced of learn M. money necessary of M. the , this who well often means that he must does des save .
agreed the )
why small le des school of lots raised gentleman single ports of 22 refers were right des other Canadians ? Position something themselves let , me seems he , Way M. fact that M. hold of la Act of M. tax sur M. income est becomes that a company who put until le 40 years for supports of des natural , simply between des mailles of M. we .
from Way his hold present , la Act of M. tax sur M. income no can not hold account of des into of des practices of la management products et of des get necessary for that a exploitation incurred supports of des natural .
des Veterans of school of lots raised the Status question since 1988 .
they put that Status long le M. change le commentary they were summer witness meetings of des creation years took fact hearts , le M. Department of des Finance et le M. Department of M. Revenue National , le a understanding reasonable of M. problem .
la question took summer entitled country Way different committees of la chamber of des House , Way Status 1998 specific national sur M. Environment et M. economy et , noted , Way our own Subcommittee Island Committee charged of study Status examined bor�ale .
honourable senators , he we must obtain Status cooperation of des school of lots raised if we want meet des commitments that we we taken streets M. agreement of Kyoto et streets M. project control of introduce sur des species fact career le M. Canada , et their give a political taxation based , who des strongly le reboiser their land et le the of efforts for well run their lands .
he est great time that we . this problem .
i request any le M. Minister of des Finance of lead le well this project .

his Honour M. Speaker :
honourable senators , Mexico Island you of agreed for that I consistent now Status statement that M. Senator Opposition Island Staunton me took donor of do le M. regarding of des affairs tax meetings of la last meeting ?
from des Senators :
from agreed .
his Honour M. Speaker :
M. 14 October , during des affairs tax , M. Senator Hays took donor Status leave of introduce , le M. reading of des notice of ways of M. government , a motion accordingly view of continue M. adjournment of M. Senate .
la leave him took summer leave , but early that Status question took summer implementation fact arguments , he there took privileged a 800 mind ownership le Status procedure le follow .
instead Status end , la motion would M. adjournment of two weeks took summer agreed et M. Senate est past le another something .
nevertheless , when M. order of M. day took summer types , M. Senator Opposition Island Staunton took donor le M. Speaker of Chief Status question order of avoid whole mind le M. future .
i thank many M. Senator Opposition Island Staunton of bringing raised Status question , I think that this est significant .
thereafter le this request , I I well bringing le Status question et I am now prepared le me deal sur my deals of M. due of des rules et the of M. Senate .
streets my statement , I me am ' of look M. more of cases possible , but I no am not sure of bringing been all des for .
accordingly addition , tariffs review speaks licences of reported some fundamental et incoh�rences streets M. Rules , sur reasons M. Committee Standing of des privileges , of M. Rules et of la procedure should themselves Lavoie .
la basic present of des affairs tax fact part of la procedure of M. Senate since 1991 .
this year Island headed , M. Rules of M. Senate took summer amended for question M. order streets cetera des issues of des affairs tax bound appel�es le Status follow of des correct of senators .
regard order est established le M. rule 23 ( 6 ) .
M. section standing Way elsewhere that des issues of privilege et des or le M. Rules are it le M. reading of des affairs tax et that everything ! Way Appeal . asked est . le 17 h 30 , except fact cases of motion without debate eye without give .
from other provisions of M. section provisions M. hour le commentary themselves hearings Status period of des issues et M. hour le commentary M. order of M. day eliminated types if M. time expected for des affairs tax est Teleglobe .
la period of des affairs tax understand Status Presented of reports of committees committees or special , des notice of ways of M. government , thereby that des notice of ways introduced Way of other senators .
traditionally , des seeking compound simply introduce their report et des senators market notice of la motion .
but le M. opportunity , la leave est demand�e of proceed sur Island M. Island terrorism , or more later le M. during of la Francophonie , le Status arguments of M. report of gentleman Committee .
from same , le M. reading of des notice of ways , M. chairman of gentleman Committee ask Status leave of introduce a motion for allow le his Committee of themselves meet le gentleman payment where M. Senate could be fact meeting .
these recent years , all des Senate where M. Senate seat , M. Leader Deputy of M. government request almost , Status leave of introduce a motion for that M. Senate themselves while le 13 h 30 M. Wednesday rather that le 14 hours .
each read that he est asked of d�roger le Status procedure of des affairs tax , he themselves branch of gentleman notice fact due of des sections 57 or leave .
la leave est leave if nil Senator subsection streets Status Aboriginal no themselves there welcome .
if gentleman single themselves there welcome , la question no can be that prior Status end of M. respond being .
accordingly addition , if Status leave est leave , M. adoption of M. report or of la motion est proposed sur Island M. Island terrorism , except if Status request move of fact refer M. review le more later le M. during of la Francophonie .
when Status question respecting le M. report or le Status motion est implementation le des Senators , she est sujette le debate .
M. fact that these issues legal gentleman give Beauchesne clear that firms are the le debate .
nil report of Committee or motion of investigate who est implemented le des Senators no est soustrait le Status possibility of gentleman debate .
M. fact that des ways representations with la leave of M. Senate le M. reading of des affairs tax no are welcome or never not no means not that firms no qualified not M. be .
thanks des ways representations without give no can be not .
a read M. debate fact during , all des rules provision des debates are savings , there including Status possibility of gentleman order le M. Rules .
means keeps le M. fact that fact , that Status question either implementation le des Senators , M. S�ant themselves est of this fact out of des affairs tax for Status length of M. debate , far le this that he either tranch� or motion .
instead my sense , la sites of M. rule 23 ( 1 ) , when des or le M. Rules or des issues of privilege le M. reading of des affairs tax , no themselves youth not le M. debate , Chair given that M. Senate no est set more le M. reading of des affairs tax .
if , Way elsewhere , a request of ! Way Appeal . est eye le Status end of M. debate , M. rule 23 ( 3 ) standing that he eliminated . le 17 h 30 this day Island headed , except , although heard , if Status leave est leave of M. hold le gentleman another payment .
a another clause of M. section 23 themselves youth same if gentleman debate est fact during .
M. rule 23 ( 7 ) provides that le M. more later 30 minutes after M. Appeal of M. Prime developed of des affairs tax , M. Senate must proceed le Status period of des issues .
he est therefore possible that M. review of des affairs tax or gentleman debate fact during sur gentleman developed of des affairs tax either interrompu Way Status period of des issues .
from fact , this est this who themselves est product M. 6 May 1993 when M. debate fact third reading of M. project of bill C Island 114 , An Status Act election of M. Canada , took summer asked immediately after Status Presented of M. report sur M. project of bill , without amendment , Way M. Committee of des affairs legal et Constitutional .
instead this opportunity , M. project of bill had place M. reading of la third reading prior Status end of M. respond of S minutes for des affairs tax year Status period of des issues .
M. Senate est then past le M. review of M. order of M. day without back le des affairs tax .
hence therefore fact big this who can themselves proceed when M. Senate accept of foreign a motion le M. reading of des affairs tax .
i hope that these Request you allow of better understand regard weeks of our proceedings .
this who themselves est past M. Thursday 14 October last , when M. Senator Hays took donor Status leave of introduce a motion designed le continue M. adjournment of M. Senate , was therefore act le our rules et the .

from des Senators :
for !
M. hon. John Lynch Island Staunton ( Chief of M. Opposition ) :
honourable senators , I wish le credit Status Gouverneure general recently appointed et le him hoped everything M. success whom streets his new duties of representing of M. Chief of M. State Museum .
Ms board here le M. gentleman of our former colleagues who took significant a visit personal le a absent ingrate et often little appr�ci�e le his just value .
PuissentM. Rom�o LeBlanc et his gracieuse wife , Diana , and a long retirement pleased sur des , of M. the of Northumberland .
la political can be also particular that grisante , et not only after of des election .
des reports between des different for , often d�natur�s Way des ambitions personal , we cancer often rudement le M. test .
M. success of gentleman party political , et much of his Chief , banned that recommend des d�convenues or des problems gain , est the the of la loyalty of des partisan .
honourable senators , these comments me located le M. spirit le Status follow of M. regarding have of M. Senator Graham of his duties of Leader of M. government le M. Senate .
during his mandate , M. commitment of M. Senator le M. regard of our institution et of la Nova Island Nova no took never fact alone each read that he themselves est done for him of bringing des objectives of M. government et of his party .
his qualities of man of honour et of principles no were never tree summer implemented le M. test that M. months last , et his conduct around since fact secondary a new read Status evidence .
that he me either licences of use Status thinking of Edmund the for express my reaction le M. limogeage if whose of M. Senator Graham .
la magnanimit� fact political est often M. single seaway of la wisdom et Status farmers of gentleman party political est by Way des spirit the .
Cline said , le M. behalf of des members of our caucuses et of me Island even , I wish right opportunity le M. Senator Boudreau le M. station of Leader of M. government .
however , his person that he est here Alberta for redorer M. blason of his party fact Nova Island Nova , this that he took fact of way extraordinary streets M. speech that he took speech he there took few the , est troublante because she interest of des issues sur M. pleasant streets this chamber non house fact left a absent public �lective .
M. Senator Boudreau took demagogic without ambages that he had M. intended of be run le Status chamber of des House le des next election .
this est le my notice as if gentleman that of la des national of hockey , the themselves do send streets a ligue mineure .
i hope that M. Senator Boudreau apprendra move le together M. importance et des accomplishments of M. Senate et that he themselves letter account that this est streets this chamber that des projects of bill are M. better them , where M. spirit of party no est never too speech et where des partisan of M. government , des ministers et des senators of Aboriginal plan are all include as of des individuals et non as of des automates , et that they themselves form fact died , free of des do cut le our colleagues streets M. another place .
des senators of et Furey , who were proposed et seconded Status motion respecting le M. Adresse fact response le M. speech of M. another , run are acquitt�s with vast ground et expressed of their role .
he no 50 however not consider streets their comments another something that a domestic reference le M. speech who took dangerous pes� le His Excellency et who attend gentleman approach becoming with 22 that she took speech after his assermentation .
M. Senator of fact took fact little of cases , no him their that few for 2 , et we took given a have of his commitment deep shown his country et M. government , this that took fact also M. Senator Furey .
accordingly fact , they no sons not M. choice before gentleman speech whose remembered him parliamentarian et who est immediately become gentleman non Island distance .
this who avoided subsequently be a vision for M. century le come themselves est lives fact a litanie of and .
M. Stratton of anticipation 1997 sur M. standing everyone of proposals little for deal des serious problems that we some currently .
gold , le Status vast knew of all , M. speech of M. another took shock Subcommittee bringing M. agriculture of M. West , who you Status low crisis since des years 30 , des fisheries , who are fact legislation le of Montr difficulties , M. immigration ill�gale , who trahit des failles of la introduce Canadian , des difficulties of des companies air that , even today today , M. government rather that something something types des " forces of M. market " rule , et Status reduction of des taxes who , if remembered d�chiffre des few words who there are spent , eliminated do just prior des next election .
la poverty et M. found of des without Island Relief no were situation summer mentioned .
however , he there took two aid who were summer the streets M. speech of M. another et whose I like speak .
M. Prime relative la statement according commentary M. government no tell more never that M. remembered perde M. control of des Finance of M. State .
he est rassurant of see that those Island headed same who were headed le M. era et who were attempt guide des Finance of la dealing go le Status the were nothing Way understand , even if enough no took not summer easy .
i think fact particular le M. Prime Minister who , p parliamentarian that chairman of M. Council of M. President et Minister of des Finance streets des years positions , took great contributed le M. global of M. deficit budget , who took sextupl� , et of la debt public strong , who took number .
this that M. government no staff not , but whose everything M. world themselves Chalifoux of more fact more account , this est that des good results francophone le des professional budget et stability are 10 le M. fact that M. remembered took continued of apply des policies various Way des governments Mulroney , tourism des Liberals were who le M. era , le whether Status reduction of des spending of programs pursuant le des needs declaration real , la creation of gentleman amount of operations , la reduction of des rate of interest et a reduction of M. rate of inflation .
these results , who no lend never could be require Subcommittee des former Liberals , et M. open Island free Island dimensional themselves national learned these same MPs d�pensiers Island are now le Status Basic of des policies current of M. government , gentleman government who tait effront�ment des efforts most tell Way des governments Mulroney , who est was Way Status great Opposition that he took political against these measures when firms were summer the , consumer Status tax sur des products et services .
accordingly September 1990 , M. Chief of M. Party Liberal had said that :
... Status position of M. party est clear .
we we opposons le Status GST et no want not of his implementation fact implementation .
recently , M. Prime Minister took fact M. hard of Clairvaux tax et out whole Robertson of M. eliminate , et this same sur M. material of reading , thereby that fact took regulatory gentleman ! held here fact September .
M. second developed who attention my attention streets M. speech est more department because he door sur M. future of our country .
M. government of M. Canada ' therefore M. commitment that he took retired shown des Quebecers et all des other Canadians , le whether that M. principle of the set Way Status Court Supreme of M. Canada eliminated therefore .
further le some hear less nuanc�s of some door Island speaking of M. government , notes suggests hear that fact cases of gentleman wishes , M. government Liberal took M. intended of out le his way M. view of la Court Supreme sur la question of gentleman ! house le Status went !
i saying view because this no est not a decision , but well a view that Status Court Supreme took decision .
none streets this view no is who that this either .
ownership le me , la court est care too far fact d�passant des three issues that she was called le by et , this bad , she amendments le gentleman debate political who no est not of his responsible .
why ?
Undeterred I think that Status Court Supreme est care too far streets his set , individually I am three that M. government federal themselves fine prepared le participate le gentleman wishes , non only prior that he no themselves moved , but same prior that he no either known !
la priority primordiale of everything government National est M. unity of M. country , et never he no should question gentleman court who the le M. dealing of similar Island side .
accordingly interpr�tant le his way a series of conditions waves et one of la Court Supreme , M. government risk fact effect of themselves find expect streets a over who could , paid le all des Canadians .
i like late fact continuing of a great concern very Way many , this est Island le Island say M. fact that M. Parliament , et especially Status chamber of des House , est of more fact more d�phas� .
i no I never danger my admiration for Status form of government of des United Island United , because their regime based sur gentleman system of system who knew des followed refers M. gentleman of des powers can themselves thoughts single .
M. more often , M. chairman et M. Congress are allows le Status research of Iraq , because all des two are des major the of M. developing et of M. adoption clear of des laws .
des mistakes of M. organized et des camouflages no just not inaper�us well long , because , le M. lower the , M. Congress fact investigation .
he sometimes often , he est real , that M. power legislative which exag�r�ment M. advantage that he refers for Teleglobe long a appointment pr�sidentielle or something another initiative of M. organized , but means no during nothing le M. fact that des two powers are more or less sur gentleman feet of equality et can welcome success M. gentleman without M. another .
la chamber no sitting that since few days when M. government took low Status light for implement end le M. debate sur M. project of bill C Island 6 .
he took direct of fact do tree for M. project of bill sur M. agreed the nisga' took .
why ?
simply because these projects of bill , we said Island remembered , were summer said elsewhere , et that a study more the le des Commons no elected nothing of nine .
perhaps Island remembered express more clear his contempt for Status democracy Parliamentary ?
unfortunately , M. Senate took summer dealt le little nearly of la same manner when he took summer reminded for debate M. project of bill C Island 6 , sur M. Environment , et M. project of bill C Island called , sur des Plan .
sit�t fact station , M. new Minister of M. continues took deficit that M. project of bill C Island 6 had summer enough otherwise chamber et that nil amendment no citing accept .
instead M. Committee , la majority took low Status light , assure gentleman report agreement took summer line le M. Senate break that M. project of bill was entach� of dangerous of policy that a review should three immediately after his adoption .
la light took summer forced le Status third reading , des senators served the that , even if M. project of bill had of many obtain , he many higher le Status bill existante .
accordingly standing M. project of bill C Island 6 , la majority le M. Senate took fact fact consciemment seconded gentleman project of bill everything fact knowing that he avoided subsequently do M. subject of gentleman review more review , according M. role the of M. Senate .
this no est not headed M. a of his best accomplishments .
M. project of bill sur des Plan took summer the of M. months of June le M. months of September for give le M. Council of M. President et le M. Alliance of la Fonction public Status opportunity of themselves meet le M. during of M. summer for trying of involved some , , everything particular fact this who touchait des caught the .
M. Council of M. President took refused of meet M. says for discussion of la question , all�guant that these caught the le M. government .
la new chairman of M. Council of M. President themselves est montr�e also inflexible .
reflecting no took comprehensive held nil account of M. judgment agreement of M. Senate .
instead M. during of M. debate of third reading , remembered us took fact whether that if M. says wanted do current his concern relatively le M. share of M. amount , he should the a include fact justice .
heretofore still , M. Senate took message his responsibilities during le M. chapter of M. review special order of meet a secondary voice of M. outside supporting that M. project of bill either passed despite his other .
i I resigned more tard that M. new Leader of M. government le M. Senate had summer number of la amount of workplace that we people here Way report le this who themselves fact le M. another place .
i am of notice that this who themselves est product fact September est subsequently more le M. look who . a was that le gentleman own during fact view of reduce des diversity of M. Senate le M. process Parliamentary et I am sure that le M. during of Clairvaux new session , we reprendrons our responsibilities during , everything fact Chair always well le M. fact of des d�sirs of la chamber house .
i think well also that des military their supporting that remembered whether le M. Opposition all des the of Committee that she handed complete a no are not allegations .
no regardless ones commentator independent no declaration that recognize that des the of Committee a Way of des colleagues of my party le M. during of la first session of la presented th were summer certain with ground et le M. honour of M. Senate .
obviously Robertson of reduce without concern Status contribution of non Island partisan of M. government le M. system of des committees themselves heurtera le a serious long , non not Way the , but because that Status vast value of our institution based sur gentleman touchstone of cooperation et non of , the .
instead M. era where we convinced the of M. side of M. Opposition , we we the several read Island well that with trying , I M. concerns Island le M. envy of do of M. shocking for M. changes of do of M. shocking , this who took summer M. cases during a right part of des years 1980 et fact 1990 when des / were the .
we we worked attempt le M. October of two projects of bill , regarding M. Pearson Pearson et regarding M. the of la to election , because they were clear anticonstitutionnels .
we the always le M. spirit that Status strongly of des representatives elected must be whose , to that she themselves the streets des line of la Constitution .
honourable senators , M. success of M. Senate themselves extent non not Way M. exploitation of a majority for do adopt of des projects of bill le Status April , but rather Way Status contribution of all des senators le M. c of des measures legislation who we parviennent of M. another place .
no grant le M. Opposition that gentleman role for streets this process , this citing Use M. Senate fact a regions raising of la chamber of des House et give still more of have le those who levels le do introduction our institution .
a ceremony attitudes could investigations destroy M. spirit present of cooperation et of regard who , he est that of M. see , no est not abroad le M. Alternative of M. Opposition for M. Senate , gentleman Alternative that Status majority , I M. hope , continue of share .

they were fourth le Status Yukon of la sense .
M. 6 June 1995 , M. Committee took submitted le M. Senate his report entitled : " idea Status life et of la death " .
according me , M. one of this project of bill est importance for give le M. Senate M. deserves who him talk of full right .
some type of laws no . not des pr�ambules .
however , streets M. cases subsection , he no est not only change , but he Chalifoux justice le M. Committee , who took worked very work .
i like now speak of points funding of M. project of bill S Island 2 .
M. section 2 of M. project of bill provides that nil section of care of health no can be recognized found of a criminal fact under of M. Code criminal for bringing CRTC le a person of des 1980 with M. intended of that or of do replacement his that person , le of des same base abr�ger his life .
streets his report entitled : " idea Status life et of la death " , M. Committee Standing Special staff that Status practice who challenge le deal M. men of manner le that his suffering , even if she can abr�ger Status life of M. men , est currently into .
M. Code criminal no attend not des care palliative , even if means can abr�ger Status life of M. men , p tree that des care are state of way act le des practices medical generally laws .
however , gentleman number number of witnesses were stated le M. Committee that des doctors h�sitaient often le fund enough of 1980 antidouleur if means the of abr�ger Status life of des entitled , of turn of be held criminellement responsible of M. Late of their entitled .
from very many witnesses him having described Status mind who China parliamentarian home des professionals of la health that le M. within of la population fact General ownership le Status the of la practice , M. Committee Standing Special took recommended le M. action that des provisions asking of M. Code criminal recommend , .
many are des doctors themselves sp�cialisant streets des care palliative who regulation that M. single of la sense no abr�ge never Status life of M. men .
according some evidence tax , when Status leaves of des 1980 est well courts , des entitled themselves adaptent simply le Status long ill of des 1980 facilities .
however , we no fact we no evidence et , le my notice , headed no est not Status found issue .
all tree that we caught , we should ensure le this that des entitled le M. Canada suffering M. less possible .
M. Committee Standing no est not M. single le possibility that remembered clarifie des provisions of M. Code criminal who together sur la possibility of fund gentleman single who , everything fact att�nuant Status sense , risk of abr�ger Status life of M. men .
la Commission of reform of M. right had five Status same recommendation streets gentleman report that she took report fact 1983 .
from more , M. Association medical Canadian the Status in of la bill streets this area since 1992 .
M. Committee Standing Special of M. requires more general of " single purposes le that Status that " , but M. section 2 of M. project of bill est five of way le mean des reduced where of des 1980 are facilities for that of des suffering �motionnelles or citizens .
instead my notice , he must user of taken et nothing streets this project of bill no should significant Status expected , et yet we know all that M. single of la that �motionnelle or involved prepared le Status expected .
M. section 2 no court not des the streets des cases where he could there bringing gentleman another kind of responsibility justice , as Status consideration thing .
honourable senators , and Island me well : M. section 2 no themselves youth participate not le des cases where he there took rich of civil Status death .
he no themselves youth that streets des cases where M. remembered means that des suffering Len of M. men .
he est very significant of M. negative .
none no should times le his responsibility thing if his intended est of child something gentleman .
M. rule 3 ) 1 ) of M. project of bill S Island 2 provides that M. soignant no est not found of a criminal portion Way M. Code criminal of M. single fact that le Status request of a person Party , he themselves abstient of him fund gentleman single of survival or fact , M. administration .
M. rule 3 ) 2 ) clarifie des circumstances streets reasons a request est act floor le des purpose of M. rule 3 ) 1 ) .
from des Energy there studies , especially le des laws of a province , celebrating always us .
la most of des provinces were already passed of des provisions legislation sur des Energy studies .
M. Alberta est Status last province le bringing passed a bill le this regarding ; fact effect , la Personal the giving took summer the et est coming fact effect M. 1 December 1997 .
M. Manitoba , Newfoundland Island island , la Nova Island Nova , M. Ontario et M. Quebec were also l�galis� Status Letter of this that M. remembered reserves , streets M. in , des testaments biological .
la British Island British et le M. Island Island Prince Island E Island Prince were passed of des laws fact this equity , but Right Island side no are not still fact effect .
instead alone of Energy there data pr�alablement pursuant le des laws of a province , of des clear there non official or a request eye that or Way it , p presence of le M. less gentleman witness , fabric a request floor .
M. rule 3 ) 3 ) provides that a another request can be eye Way gentleman status , gentleman representing Senate or gentleman Joint , but only if M. men no took not Status capacity of M. do or if , during that he fact was Party , he no took not fact of request floor .
streets his report entitled : " idea Status life et of la death " , M. Committee Standing Special took person M. such of single of survival as Chair M. fact of no not good gentleman single global of maintain M. men fact life , Way example no not trying Status the cardiorespiratoire agreed RCR ) , no not give a us . , no not fund of final or no not ensure M. food et M. hydratation artificielles .
he took person M. required as M. fact of mean gentleman single global of maintain M. men fact life , Way example d�brancher M. respirateur .
M. Committee Standing Special took resigned that des courts parliamentarians were recognized le des entitled M. right fact the the of agree gentleman single medical or of hold that gentleman single , a read began , namely interrompu .
streets of des affairs as Malettec. Schulman , p 1990 , Dr. B . C H�tel Island God of Quebec , p 1992 et streets M. matter Rodriguez , p 1993 , des courts were says recognized this right , even if Status died of Clairvaux such or of Clairvaux required of single of survival est Status death .
i think that he est significant of back sur some of these causes with you .
streets M. matter Mallettec. Schulman , p 1990 , la Court of Appeal of M. Ontario took disgraceful that des Energy sur des meeting issue data during that a the fact was Party eligible be quite , even if she no had not Status capacity of take a decision .
la court took launch that M. doctor predicted meet des Energy there of gentleman witness of J�hovah who leading whole us . , even streets a situation of emergency where Status the no finest give his consent .
instead des words of la decision that she took decision fact January 1992 streets M. matter Dr. B . , la Court Coast of M. Quebec took launch that Status the day Party , enjoyed of a infected incurable et alit�e until le Status end of his days , had M. right of ask that his doctor d�branche M. respirateur who Status maintenait fact life .
accordingly anyone his decision , M. judge Dufour took quote des sections of M. Code Civil of M. Quebec according compete Status person tragedy est inviolable et proposed no can be forced of look gentleman single without his consent .
this matter that also of la responsibility thing of M. doctor who predicted , le Status request of Dr. B . , d�brancher M. respirateur .
after themselves be . le des sections 216 , 217 , Issue et 219 of M. Code criminal , thereby that le des provisions sur M. M. the , M. judge took signed that gentleman doctor no Command not evidence of a conduct the , gratuite or the fact d�branchant M. respirateur of a the le Status request of similar Island side et fact interesting Status infected of la the follow his during continue .
accordingly 1993 , Mr. M. judge Sopinka , of la Court Supreme of M. Canada , who took prepared Status decision The streets M. matter Rodriguez , took sworn recognized M. right of des entitled of no not 1986 le gentleman single or of ask that M. single either interrompu , even if Status death predicted fact and .
he est significant of themselves remind that , streets this cases , la majority no was not fact favour of M. care et of M. assistance le M. suicide .
she was however fact favour of M. right le M. such or le M. required of M. single , entitled who est M. subject of M. project of bill le M. study .
however , honourable senators , of des witnesses were said before M. Committee Special that , streets some cases , remembered no had not therefore M. chamber of des entitled because that M. Code criminal no was not clear et that des the the of be held responsible .
instead suffer of these evidence sur la mind who exists among des the et Status population fact General , M. Committee Standing Special took recommended le new le M. action that Status the the fact effect either codifi�e of way le Chief des circumstances streets reasons he est legal acceptable of no not provide or of regret gentleman single of survival .
yet headed , M. Committee Standing no was not M. Prime le established that M. right either clarifi� streets this area .
accordingly 1983 , la Commission of reform of M. right of M. Canada had recommended she also that M. Code criminal either clarifi� le regard regard .
since 1992 , M. Association medical Canadian was that M. Code criminal either clarifi� fact this who relative M. right Senate of implement end le gentleman single order of implement des the le M. Relief of des Director .
honourable senators , M. section 6 of M. project of bill S Island 2 est M. more there example of M. fusionnement of my project of bill when , M. S Island 13 , et of M. project of bill of M. Senator � Island studies , M. S Island 29 .
M. project of bill S Island 29 act M. predatory of page presence for M. single of la sense et for M. such et M. required of treatment of survival .

from many witnesses who are came before M. Committee were recommended that remembered give more of line et of Training le des providers of care of health sur des care palliative et M. control of la sense .
almost all des witnesses who were regime before M. Committee Special of M. Senate themselves has le say that of des research more increase were necessary streets these areas .
honourable senators , M. project of bill S Island 2 est M. result Kim of M. workplace of M. Committee Special of M. Senate sur M. care et M. suicide attended .

he designed le Chief M. right p�nal fact codifiant Status the the existante et fact Status anyone available et , for all des Canadians , sooner of protect des entitled et their providers of care of health .
i want with look M. debate sur this project of bill .
this who est more significant still , I want with look M. study fact Committee , where remembered existing et would this extent of way more research .
i am particular pleased of la participation of M. Senator � Island studies , who , as me , means that des recommendations of M. Committee Special of M. Senate become bill .
this project of bill no est can Island be not still informed this that he must .
unfortunately , p parliamentarian that effects Agriculture , we no caught not are .
i hope that M. Committee Standing of des affairs legal et Constitutional take this project of bill real order of themselves ensure that he answer le des needs of des Canadians et that he there and of des amendments for M. improve le M. need .
i wish that this project of bill either also good that he incurred M. be , et I know that this est also headed M. forward of M. Senator � Island studies et of des other members of M. Committee Special of M. Senate .
i hope that we able send this project of bill quickly le M. Committee order that his study , who , of Way his nature , hopefully many of time , pure start without decision , prior that M. Committee Standing Standing of des affairs legal et Constitutional , whereas for his openness hours et his back charged , no either le des taken with la also absent of des measures legislation of initiative yesterday .
honourable senators , I you look le look M. project of bill S Island 2 et I you urge le M. support .
M. hon. Douglas Roche :
Mrs. M. Senator Senator Island she of answer le a issue ?
M. Senator Carstairs :
surely .
M. Senator Roche :
thank .
i wish of first express my learning le M. Senator Carstairs for Status the whose she took fact evidence fact body his project of bill .
i hope that he there speaks gentleman debate review sur this important issue et that remembered no cherchera not le themselves be of this project of bill le Status look , sooner that remembered beneath actions M. opportunity , brilliant le M. reading of la second reading le M. Senate that le M. reading of M. study fact Committee , of fact do M. review that he deserves .
accordingly thought of dispute le my contribution le M. debate of this subject , I like question two issues le M. Senator Carstairs , if she M. means well .
from first , M. Senator Carstairs took demagogic without " that M. project of bill Plan le did Status sense et non le �courter Status life , but as M. fact of did Status sense can bringing for effect of �courter Status life , M. Senator Carstairs might Island she that means incurred open Status door le M. suicide attended ?
she took demagogic very clear that of des treatment most for continue Status life no are not necessary of gentleman developed of view d�ontologique , but , streets M. single of des entitled fact usually Mr. , no there took he not gentleman safe that des various pressure themselves . qualified discussions le a form of by or of press fact favour of M. use of 1980 att�nuant Status sense le of des purpose . , or le of des purpose non d�clar�es open , who consistent fact fact le �courter Status life ?
M. Senator Carstairs :
honourable senators , I thank M. Senator of his issue , because that becomes est give M. discussed importance of whole Status question .
this est why we must bringing of des page presence et of des means of control .
i renverrais M. Senator le M. cat�chisme of M. Church Catholic , consumer le M. section 2279 , because that Status difference there est enough clear Gigant .
M. cat�chisme said follows :
even if Status death est case imminente , remembered no can the regret des care families le being le gentleman past .
M. use of analg�siques for did des suffering of M. mourant , even le M. risk of abr�ger his days , perhaps be considered under act le Status dignity tragedy , if Status death no est not deal as a end or gentleman average .
for me , this kind of in est if necessary that if M. project of bill no Status news not , we must we ensure that she there serving .
i think that this est already M. cases , but wishes , modifions Island M. for that this either participate clear .
M. Senator Roche :
i thank M. hon. Senator .
la response est certainly proposal le M. importance of M. debate .
my second issue relates sur M. Code criminal .
i no do not very well why M. project of bill objective le codifier Status the the existante or le permit some actions who biological opportunity be duty as of des actions criminal without bringing le change M. Code criminal him Island even .
why means Island remembered guard of change M. Code criminal fact standing M. project of bill ?
M. Senator Carstairs :
honourable senators , yet a read , I thank M. hon. Senator of his issue .
he est interesting of negative that , streets M. Prime project of bill that I I presented , he there had a amendment of M. Code criminal .
however , le M. during of M. debate et of des discussions le M. Senate , et also Way Status follow , streets M. project of bill of M. Senator � Island studies , he est become obviously that we take more that a amendment of M. Code criminal .
we tentions also of establish of des page presence national et of implement fact hearts of des measures of control et of do do of des experience et of des work of research sur M. control of la sense .
agreed sur la motion of M. Senator DeWare , le M. behalf of M. Senator � Island studies , M. debate est motion . )
la strategy of M. decide for des aboriginal
inquiry Island Adjourned of M. debate
M. hon. Thelma J . Chalifoux , pursuant le M. notice given M. 14 October 99 :
Island honourable senators , he est difficult for Status most of des Canadians of understand why he member of des does between des conditions of life et des challenges of des aboriginal et those of des other citizens of M. Canada .
he est also difficult for themselves of understand why he must adopt of des rural different fact reason of la situation , of des rights , of des values et of M. potential of des aboriginal .
means est can Island be difficult le understand , but he est importance of M. understand for power financial fact regard .
la strategy of M. decide designed le determine if des recent decisions of M. government federal allow of improve des conditions of decide of des families aboriginal et if of important believe can be concerning le Status strategy federal present .
this document of workplace est purposes le assist gentleman real dialogue sur des prices good of a strategy who we Kelleher remedy streets M. next century et sur la wish way of la implement fact implementation .
we we chosen of we go sur des forces of all des Peoples le M. Canada et des sources of these forces for fact happen le a strategy the .
a source of strength sometimes , et implementation of side est Status strongly et M. right of des Peoples aboriginal Island des M , des war et des members of des Nations First Island of and et of implement fact implementation their own rural .
this est this strength who took typical M. launch with success of hundreds of initiatives arguments of la Basic .
sometimes , firms were summer g�n�es Way of des tracasseries force or no were could discussions for a reason whatever .
from other initiatives arguments of des aboriginal themselves Island executory were executive Status made of des facilities ports et then declaration , thereby that of des graduate important sur compete we comptons now .
if we can better combiner des points strong of des aboriginal et of des Canadians fact General et whom these forces for improve M. decide , we close fact many more that anyone finest themselves there expect .
i try now me consider sur la broad et M. subject of la strategy fact equity of decide for des families aboriginal .
some can think that we no we not need of a another study sur des conditions of decide or a study sur des ways of change des programs declaration streets M. hope that des families aboriginal qualified fact learn some benefits .
we caught of agreed .
too of these studies were already summer assess et were led le a low c of des conditions of life .
from more , we we all could benefit of des counsel et of la research without precedent of la Commission Royal sur des Peoples aboriginal , p 1996 .
we now now des creation accomplishments of M. initiative " the our forces " , M. plan of partisan that M. government federal took lengthy fact January 1997 .
we recall up that of other partners streets Status Confederation annonceraient themselves also their professional et their words .
instead this chapter , we caught the .
some progress are the , but several senators et leaders aboriginal themselves concern of more fact more of M. lack of measures little taken for improve des conditions of decide of des families aboriginal .
we want the gentleman dialogue National sur la need of establish a strategy clear et more association fact equity of decide for des families aboriginal .
we want we go sur M. accept ensure of a strategy for des families experience le M. outside of des item et of des lands implemented of side for des Peoples aboriginal streets M. framework of agreements sur des concern land , .
des families aboriginal experience sur these lands were , le des words of include et of la bill , of des conditions of decide who diff�rent many of Right of des families experience elsewhere .
nevertheless that he fact either , obviously strategy fact equity of decide must hold account of des mouvements of population sur these lands .
many of M , of war et of members of des Nations First top vigorous des communaut ancestrales for consider of M. workplace , of des opportunities prometteuses et of des housing , streets des main et small cities of M. Canada .
this est a charged value who putting themselves continue .
reflecting knows well also that their rate of natalit� est higher le Status average national , everything as M. number of their young est more high , since Status population aboriginal est 10 years more young that Status population fact General .
he there took tremendous years , remembered d�nombrait less of 200 40,000 aboriginal .
today today , he there fact took more of 1 created who living le M. Canada .
this sales no understand not however Status population of des M of M. country .
many of other aboriginal living le des United Island United et can or non back le M. country after their years of workplace .
reflecting provides that Status population aboriginal putting increasing the 40,000 persons le M. during of la next generation .
his conditions social et economic no the that of credit believe .
a strategy fact equity of decide reasonable must power answer le des needs future confidence of la population aboriginal et le des new words .
i try now tell why des conditions et des problems of decide of des aboriginal are different .
a reason important for commentary more of la level of des families aboriginal living today today streets of des housing research le des standards est a vast poverty persistante .
many are often sur M. developed of themselves patients streets Status Maritime or top living streets of des communaut added , to et to already surpeupl�es .
des jobs that des aboriginal friends are difficulty which et they must using le M. reduced their involved of paye for answer le des needs basic fact food et fact Clothing of families more many that Status average .
reflecting estimated that M. income of employment of des aboriginal 4 le M. two 33 of 22 of la average national .
more of 40 % of between themselves no sons not of income of employment fact 1995 .
they were little or not of Vote .
that arriverait Island he if des aboriginal eligible obtain Status is with des Canadians means fact equity of employment et of pay ?
obviously , means their including gentleman level of life higher et everything M. Canada fact profiterait .
accordingly 1991 , M. former Minister of des Foreign Indian et of M. North Museum , Thomas Siddon , 1992 that , run he there had is of here M. year 2000 , M. product National product of M. Canada agency of increase des revenues taxation of M. government federal of 4,3 billion of million et of reduce Status debt national of 20 billion of million .
la commission Royal there est care of his own analysis sur this developed .
she took gentleman that he fact would le M. Canada 7,5 billion of million us parliamentarian that des circumstances economic et social of des Peoples aboriginal demeureraient deal le Status average national .
he regardless of note that this amount 4 le a lost of income costs of 2,9 billion of million for des Peoples aboriginal , combin�e le gentleman cost tax of 4,6 billion of million , there including 2,1 billion of million Subcommittee form of lack le assist for M. government .
unfortunately , a strategy designed le answer le des needs fact equity of decide show aware with gentleman problem of poverty aigu� home des aboriginal , because that nothing no Beauchesne that des disparit�s economic et social between Status population fact General et des aboriginal top close replacement .
la recent net of des rate of literacy et of des levels of education fact General help some families , but des housing most its inabordables for gentleman well too great number of aboriginal .
des the economic were summer down many too field le M. during of des 20 recent years for allowing grounds that M. remembered themselves est positions of M. problem of la poverty home des aboriginal .
some are more she that of other .
decisions together , these reasons were alone many of difficulties .
if we want we seat of a strategy fact equity of decide who based sur of des basis base , he citing course of look some of these reasons .
la discrimination Subcommittee all his forms remains M. a of des causes who the Status better situation of M. decide home des aboriginal .
she report le this era M. the of livres made of Standing et of decide .
nearly of 30 years more later , M. program of decide plan le M. intended of des aboriginal took scaffold M. day .
M. Program of decide of des aboriginal fact considerable urbain took follow fact ger .
des new commitments fact equity of decide streets M. framework of these programs were taken end fact same time that M. government federal took truly of take of des commitments fact equity of decide Economic M. 1 January 1994 . Pendant whole his length , M. program of decide of des aboriginal no took never fact M. subject of a assessment .
des disparit�s quality also le Status low priority leave le des issues of decide of des aboriginal .
this situation could consumer themselves tell Way M. lack of regions aboriginal le M. Parliament of M. Canada et of participation of des aboriginal le Status visible public federal .
des arcanes of M. power committees little of aboriginal for attention M. attention sur des problems raised or sur their rural .
means due many more investigations of remember des conditions streets reasons firms the .
just le M. payment where des Canadians , le be more know of des needs of des aboriginal , des words national were policy .
this situation with fact that des conditions of life own of des Canadians �clipsent Status really of des aboriginal .
honourable senators , M. idea according commentary des problems aboriginal et des rural le there contribute no future that a French namely of des problems provided et of des rural le contribute le M. environment of M. Canada est a another reason who let des also results et accomplishments le M. within of des corporations aboriginal .
none no door le grounds that a recently strategy retain given of good results le M. governmental of des years .
accordingly really , this est gentleman model no having more of deal , et of important studies of des conditions social et economic , there including M. study of December 1998 sur la clochardise , the M. adoption of on was for hold account of des into reflect compound opposite des aboriginal .
although that of des services le des aboriginal recommend came themselves add le des programs of management of M. decide , des policies et programs of Basic are those who are used for deal des problems non aboriginal , et des governments federal et provincial fact are des fiscal .
des problems of jurisdiction debates le M. decide of des aboriginal standard elsewhere that sur des lands r�serv�es le these immediately we past even .

yet , des transfers of fund , des points of tax , des powers et M. administration general more of responsibilities le des provinces .
this transfer of skills C Status expected et freine Status towards of this file .
this no are headed that few Island few of des reasons who the des does the le M. payments of M. decide of des aboriginal et of des difficulties from le this payments Way these months .

he putting without say that these reasons pr�pond�rantes the of everything their members sur M. status socio�conomique Churchill of des aboriginal today today .
honourable senators , I like now speak few of des consequences of des on federal fellow .

these numbers through according Status source et are , Way of many leaders aboriginal .
this are headed few Island Aristotle of des results comments of des on federal proposed .
instead means he must add des results comments of programs of become , of the of ensure , of research et of d�monstration , without remember des programs le M. intended of des persons seniors et of des persons lack .

honourable senators , saying that des the are centres no look not le understand Status life difficult that determine des M , des war et des Peoples of des Nations First .
a family aboriginal sur three took gentleman need more of decide , compared le a family non aboriginal sur ten .
M. need more of decide est a extent research for determine that a family cost streets of des conditions deal le Status brought et no took not des means of themselves offer a regional habitable how .

these results no compound not des has , but they were realized Status life wish le many of people et they were created a capacity et gentleman forward of do well more .
des Relations remain still m�diocres between des aboriginal et some governments ports , but firms can become best with M. time .
instead M. less , des problems of decide et des corporations of habitation were licences of good gentleman dialogue , if nothing of another no can des . .
des corporations of habitation aboriginal facilities also something something of committees .
this est Status miss institution who presented gentleman associated le day of des families aboriginal et who provides M. average of des who investigations .
their and of standing , jointes le Right of des locataires provided , their amounts of fact whether gentleman little le comments of thousands of families aboriginal et le comments of M. established of their conditions of English .
means engaged gentleman form significant for work des services le des more those streets Status society aboriginal .
pressure are des choice for a ensure strategy designed le answer le des needs of des aboriginal fact equity of decide et le des new words ?
des conditions , of decide that voice des Peoples aboriginal as le hold that remembered firm of des measures .
despite means , of other words themselves compound day who of M. attention .
according of des numbers recent , 46p. % of des children aboriginal of less of five years who living streets des main coastal , living streets of des families the .
this rate represents seven read M. rate for Status population fact General .
nearly of gentleman 33 of all des children aboriginal living streets of des families the .
la most of des families the were le their head a woman .
he 50 implement fact hearts a strategy substantial well . for e le des needs of these families fact equity of decide et of health , for e le their needs cultural et economic et for e le des needs of des young children .
la charged develop fact raises M. young age of la population aboriginal , et this charged themselves come .
M. number of children of less of five years Way woman aboriginal fact age of procr�er est positions read more high that M. rate for M. total of la population Canadian .
from des and devastating et gentleman rate of unemployment high are good among des young , yet more among des young aboriginal .
since that he took summer implemented end le Status construction of new housing , fact 1994 , la list of des aboriginal fact standing of gentleman decide themselves est allong�e .
he est obviously that M. her of housing social present no can foreign des families aboriginal or no des accept not .
these recent years , des provinces were cut their commitments or there were implemented end et he no exists not of sales available sur M. number of families aboriginal log�es streets of des housing social .
he regardless of do noted that des housing social are the sur la Basic of la might of la solvabilit� et of M. increase of M. income , this who attend M. access of des aboriginal le of des housing , regarding le des non Island aboriginal .
la commission Royal took gentleman that he eliminated necessary of build 17 40,000 new housing et of proceed le of substantial work of leadership sur following 40,000 other for power the M. the between 1996 et 2016 .
accordingly addition , 21 higher new the 10 le Status growth develop et le Status Training of new families stay also need of assistance .
without assistance financial , M. level of life of these people should he still , et M. number of families streets M. need should increasing .
instead Status follow of des decisions taken recently Way M. government federal , of des fund for M. administration of des housing social were summer ports le des provinces who were accept regard arrangement .
M. Ontario , M. Quebec , la British Island British et M. Alberta were now other for this basic .
des Agreements of transfer the des programs of decide for des aboriginal streets des coastal added et , .
M. process of transfer took little enormous of conflict et of difference between Status Standing et des providers of housing aboriginal .
consumer , des corporations , of decide aboriginal were pr�conis� of des transfers benefits le des corporations of decide aboriginal Way M. councils of Agreements light et of gentleman body National of developing .
this position est well enjoy et est can le Status political of transfer of des programs le des provinces .
this kind of arrangement took of des advantage consumer streets des centres of Training et of to .
des argumentations against des transfers offices le des provinces are figures , falls et deep enracin�s streets des objectives of autod�termination of des Peoples aboriginal .
firms insistent also sur M. lack of tabled le M. regard of these transfers .
from the consultations revenue gentleman principle paid streets M. established of des Relations with des Peoples aboriginal et gentleman principle seconded Way Status Court Supreme of M. Canada streets of des case as M. judgment Sparrow .
he there took too of des reasons of political et of operations The le Status times of des transfers provincial .
accordingly fact , none no want that des provinces can better fund of des programs that des corporations , of decide aboriginal .
no assessment independent no M. took never showed non more .
Way against , remembered knows that of des measures key as M. predatory of M. the fact visible of M. income of des locataires can be . before le M. expected of des provinces .
la Standing took tried of ensure le des corporations of decide for aboriginal that their interests streets their now of housing are protection streets des Agreements of transfer et that firms no themselves fact , not more difficulty .
these just were summer very little convaincantes .
firms common bringing M. right , although m�rit� , of take of des decisions firms Island executory .
if firms points of late of des Agreements with des provinces or with des port local Way Status follow , this eliminated their choice , gentleman choice seen sur their policies et sur their programs .
la question est of whether themselves he must plans M. transfer of des programs aboriginal et used of des Agreements of transfer with des corporations of decide for aboriginal who M. wish or allowing fact hearts Status strategy federal of transfer of des responsibilities le des provinces .
from very base arguments were summer introduced fact favour of M. energy , Way gentleman model aboriginal , of M. model of des needs more who extent M. uniqueness achieve , M. responsible le des needs et des standards of Department streets Status society Canadian .
for of des reasons she , this model for account also of la security of la family et of des practices written .
he refl�terait better Status really aboriginal when he themselves branch of assessment des needs et of develop of des on for there answer .
he c of blood le M. future of des on sur M. decide for 50 of des objectives that work already of des corporations of decide who no are le little nearly not laws Way des governments .
accordingly provide these objectives , remembered all of des , le des aboriginal , remembered Foreign account of des needs of des centres Island parents et of des Research , of des practices spirituelles , of M. access le des activities written , of des programs of la small Child et of des services aboriginal regarding M. assistance financial et M. assistance fact equity of employment .
la strategy of decide should be more le same of protect des families of M. Crime et of la violence whose firms can be victims le suffer of their Canadian aboriginal .
des changes concerning le Status Act national sur M. habitation et le Status Act sur la Corporation Canadian of Standing et of decide , who were received Status Assent Royal M. 17 June 99 , were given le Status Standing of des keep more base for grant of M. assistance et deal with of des food more many of goes , if remembered implementing believes M. Richard of des servants of la Standing , who were summer hour Way M. Committee Standing Standing of des affairs social , of des science et of la technology M. 9 June 99 . This power increase facilitera can Island be M. transfer of powers real et of gentleman number control le a new administration aboriginal of M. decide .
this strategy 4 le Status holds recommendation that took question M. Committee Standing of des affairs aboriginal fact 1992 after of openness deliberations et consultations .
M. Committee , set of representatives of all des parties , took between other recommended that M. funding of des housing aboriginal either CRTC Way M. directly of gentleman single body whose M. mandate would M. licensing of loans , M. insurance , M. developing of policies , la taken of decisions , la management of programs , la research , la Training , M. development economic et M. funding .
instead M. during of gentleman recent doing sur M. decide recognition Way M. Assembly of des Nations First , des leadership were pr�conis� a structure results for e le des needs of des members of des Nations First .
la new administration aboriginal of M. decide citing independent et avoided Status capacity of do of des laws for des aboriginal .
she avoided also M. power of used of des agreements with of des departments offices thus that of work or of offer le of des thousands of families of des services of Training et of lack , of des services debates le M. development of des young children , of des services of health et of education et of M. assistance le M. development of des businesses .
a ceremony strategy c also le des corporations of M. decide of do more with des resources financial le their clause .
la difference between M. rate cr�diteur federal et M. rate d�biteur federal could serve le secondary more of only et le support Status research sur des best initiatives et Status management .
means c also of develop of new services et products such le des add their for help des families aboriginal .
these services biological englober M. 500 et M. face of ports for des students et des care of health , because he citing possible of better using des something 200 million of million that spent M. government federal for these ports .
honourable senators , M. transfer of these attributions federal can themselves do without that he either necessary of adopt of new provisions legislation .
he compensated probably that M. Prime Minister themselves pr�vale of des powers that him authority Status Act sur des restructurations et des transfers of attributions streets M. administration public , et that M. everything either the Way of des Agreements of transfers most .
instead term term , remembered could move et adopt of new provisions legislation designed le recognize M. English of authorities local aboriginal fact equity of decide , authorities whose des powers , des duties et des good sur M. plan legal bound to .
these authorities local no manage more of des corporations without purpose seaway et firms biological create of des businesses et of des jobs streets their communities .
firms manage M. requires of M. autod�termination of des aboriginal .
this est le des Conference that he do now of implement fact implementation a strategy aboriginal amount audacieuse or of simply to Status strategy federal existante .
M. government themselves which sur des serious circumstances that living des families so of themselves patients streets Status Maritime , or who there are already , there including des families aboriginal .
we feel that , streets des main cities , M. system who provides of des services le des without Island Relief aboriginal est Status key of whole strategy designed le help these without Island Relief et that whole single of money nine should themselves do le M. average of this system .
la research Beauchesne of way as that he must develop without decision a strategy et gentleman plan of partisan for implement fact implementation of des rural le this problem get .
given given that health Canada took disgraceful that gentleman home without was the for Status health , M. problem of des without Island Relief require that of des measures recommend taken early now .
we must study serious des recommendations followed Way follow of studies , of transportation et of evidence order of introduce of des counsel specific .
des recommendations et M. plan of partisan . Status Minister responsible of des without Island Relief .
this study no must not be rel�gu�e le des oubliettes .
accordingly parliamentarian that Canadians et parliamentarians , we must non only answer le this need get , but also develop gentleman plan of partisan who poverty le all des families aboriginal Status hearts who their talk streets Status society Canadian .
des corporations of decide for des aboriginal facilities a around .
firms were only need of a opportunity et of gentleman transfer of skills for do their workplace .

la crisis economic present no visit not simply des , products .

each vendeur of machinerie est a small building .
reflecting there him le nine des tracteurs et of other the products .
when des farmers no were not of money , these businesses compound Customs et of des people past their employment .
M. government show their plan of M. insurance Island unemployment .
he est importance of no not allowing this situation perdurer , of there strategy quickly et effective .
i like speak of des impact of la crisis streets des enjoy added .
a Senate of enjoy added were decided , Way ! , of refer M. levy of des taxes ports .
i I mentioned le M. chairman of M. board any of la will of Wellington , le M. North of the , p Saskatchewan . It took disgraceful that this no est not because that des farmers no want not pay their taxes , but well that they no were not M. money for M. do .

we know all des reasons .
streets gentleman section of newspaper , remembered said that after gentleman held of nine days , M. chairman Clinton took treaty gentleman agreed crop who provides a assistance of emergency le des farmers of 8,7 billion of million .
accordingly response le means , M. chairman of M. Committee of M. agriculture took disgraceful :

M. hon. Mira Spivak :
honourable senators , I no I not tree of deal that M. Senator Gustafson le this regarding , but I am Status daughter of gentleman sometimes of la region of des lakes of M. Manitoba .
reflecting investment of la crisis crop since of des months .
during this time , des farmers were summer accul�s le M. feet of M. this because that their marges of Moncton themselves are resserr�es .
des costs �chappent le M. control of des farmers .
des price are products Way des markets international et they �chappent also le their control .
la competition est contempt le suffer of des grants same Way M. Union markets et des United Island United .
even if des farmers can rely sur M. income of gentleman or two jobs le M. outside of la strong , they are help debt et wisdom Status Customs .
they biological meaning their water , their Canadian , their source of income et M. start of life refers they are deep the .
honourable senators , des contributions personal no compound not always M. subject of ensure national , but I try simply few reasons who the why Status crisis est say le M. developed of possibly gentleman debate of emergency .
from first , la week last , of des producers products et des Ministers ministers of M. Manitoba et of la Saskatchewan are came le Ottawa for ask M. assistance of M. government federal .
they knew that he was more that des producers receive of other cash of here December for avoid Status Customs prior M. spring .
as we M. know , M. government took refused of the of new caught of money et des banks manage now change of proceed le of des saisies .
second , M. Program of assistance fact cases of personnel related le M. income crop , who predicted gap a see streets des programs provided of security of M. income crop , est gentleman disaster .
instead M. Manitoba , more of 55p. % of des farmers whose Status request took summer addressed until le subsection no were received no assistance .
estimates , M. effect of la crisis crop est found non only Way des , products family , but also Way almost everything M. world fact considerable plan .
des people no can pay their meeting .
they the less of the products .
des �coliers materials their , school of M. year certain .
almost everything M. world must themselves serrer Status the , rogner sur everything et say .
participation , M. level of way increase quickly home des farmers et their families et streets des central added .
he look of read des letters Canadian Way of des children le M. Prime Minister for see le ones developed des parents are own stress�s .
des issues were summer clarifi�s et Status crisis took summer implementation fact light meetings of meetings that I I use here et le M. Manitoba with of des skills of farmers d�sesp�r�s .
he we were summer very both of des bringing hour here , le M. Senate .
they are get , et , Way of des forces who �chappent complete le their control .
how can Island we , le M. Senate , looking Status situation themselves the more without grant a attention appropriate le their concerns streets M. framework of gentleman debate of emergency ?

however , whatever est Status valid crime ?
pressure programs are such for implement end le Status poverty of des children et when close Island we fact hearts a strategy national ?
although that des Canadians having including Status need of increasing des spending le M. payments of des programs social equipped known M. speech of M. another , they were dealing summer the that M. government retain essential of novo gentleman plan of partisan for help des more those .
that comptons Island we do for did des difficulties of des Canadians who were summer private of their rights ?
la fight against Status poverty le M. Canada going Way Status party , M. determination , M. commitment , la compassion et des Kyoto little .
h�las , M. 12 October last , M. government no we took unique that a list of words .
he must that des Canadians et des mandate of tomorrow qualified say , p out M. subsection Parliament , that he themselves one of men et of women . le build gentleman Canada more strong et a wish quality of life for their children et their small Island children .
accordingly my quality of Joint of M. group of workplace of M. Party Party Island Conservative sur la poverty , I me am entretenue with many of individuals et of follow of des poor of gentleman across le M. another of M. country .
their Richard d�nonce M. enormous huge of la poverty , too well for des individuals that for Status society .
many of persons were indicated that des programs of fight against Status poverty no agreements not that improve Status situation of des 1,000 Island plugs of today today , but they the also des encourage socio�conomiques future of M. Canada .
this are headed two elements the , honourable senators .
a right political economic hormone against a right political social .
M. a no putting not without M. another .
he no est not cash of remind le des senators that Status poverty le M. Canada took balance of des the did .
no we talking remembered not without one of des million of small Canadians who living Subcommittee M. increase of la poverty ?
M. Winter Chair close le our closing , des families are of more fact more many le build themselves atteler le Status doctors job of and gentleman decide .
M. speech of M. another no took dedicated that a half Island line le des without Island Relief .
Way approach , M. 26 October , M. The Ottawa Citizen took published gentleman section ago sur Catherine Luxton , a fillette , years who took retired conscience of la new crisis of M. problem of M. itin�rance .
she took decided , with M. assistance of his father , of do something something for help des n�cessiteux .

as he est the of see a young daughter recognize gentleman need the streets our society et determine of do something something immediately for strategy le Status situation .
why M. government speaks Island he if long prior of fact do tree ?
from des thousands of Canadians living streets des land , Subcommittee des our , streets des on .
this are des citizens mining of our society .
M. problem of des without Island Relief est gentleman problem real et serious refers too of Canadians are witness today today ; this est gentleman problem whose I your that M. government forward otherwise streets M. speech of M. another .
shooting Teresa we took implemented fact Access when she took demagogic :
we basis essential , you et me , p visible of this that we advanced for des poor .
now that M. budget est exc�dentaire , I hope that M. government fact take for themselves address serious le M. problem the et get of la poverty le M. Canada prior that up for him M. hour of M. judgment last .
la vision of streets M. speech of M. another took difference M. accept that M. government stand take streets M. year who comes .
i committed M. government of bringing had Status pr�voyance of recognize that gentleman Plan streets des creation years of our children est gentleman Plan streets M. future of our country .
however , for rompre M. i of la poverty , he must give le all des children le M. Canada a opportunity equal of supports everything their potential .
he est better of see that they no fact were not Status possibility today today .
if we could strategy with success le des conditions social who perp�tuent Status poverty family , honourable senators , we could higher a new generation of children Island of des children whose des needs essential are combl�s for that they qualified become of des members of la society Canadian fact right health , allow et the .
M. Prime Minister took demagogic :
we must proceed also quickly that possible of des words le des actions .
these words no want nothing say , realize held of M. fact that fact 1989 , a resolution designed le ce Status poverty home des children prior M. year 2000 took summer agreed Way all des parties le M. another place .
honourable senators , ten years were past et he est yet . of see that M. government took fact well little for their des small Canadians , whose gentleman sur five took M. the taken .
instead extent that Status poverty themselves r�pand le M. Canada , this 1993 fact M. surprised of M. government suggests less of hope .
M. government took dollar of new investments streets Status Prestation national for children , but since he there took gentleman billion today today , why never Island he le tomorrow for take of des measures ?
when he took pleasant des poor across le M. Canada , M. group of workplace sur la poverty of M. caucuses National of M. Party Party Island Conservative took often et clear heard say that M. time est ratify for M. government federal of r�indexer Status Prestation national for children le M. rate of inflation .
instead M. during of la last session , M. MP Party Island Conservative of Shefford , le M. Quebec , took panacea a motion of M. same kind le M. another place .
M. government Liberal took terminal that he entendait leaders gentleman billion of million for region M. medical of the et M. bringing of six months le gentleman year .
i me welcome of Clairvaux initiative et of la pr�voyance that took M. government fact recognition that he est significant that des parents just of M. time with their children during des creation years of Training .
however , when remembered there does le two read , remembered themselves request who le M. just economy of Clairvaux regarding .
account held of des change Somalia sur M. market of M. workplace , he there took great of workers be et own .
gold , these people no compound not part of M. regime of insurance Island employment .
from more , this extent no fact nothing for help those who are society of M. market of M. workplace if .
she no answer not le des needs of des women le low income who no able not benefit of gentleman medical of the if their Joint no 1,000 not of money .
that fact est Island he of M. Chief of a family monoparentale who no can rely that sur him Island even or she Island even ?
i think power say that this no est not Status question of M. medical of the who concern des much parliamentarians , but well similar who challenge le find des means of implement of M. hundreds sur la Contents .
des United Human were stated that M. Canada was M. better country le M. world for living .
yet , whom million of Canadians living Subcommittee M. increase of la poverty .
M. 12 October last , des Canadians sons need that remembered their revealing gentleman plan body of des rural little order of eliminate Status poverty , M. number of des without Island Relief et Status need of bringing of des banks of food .
unfortunately , they were heard of waves gone who bound and streets gentleman respond approximatif .
instead M. the of M. economy century , I implore M. government of adopt a position courageuse et audacieuse , of do gentleman own concert� et of themselves commitment le also M. level of life order of do of la vision of streets M. speech of M. another a really for des those .
i M. implore of reduce M. gap between des off et des poor , of majorer Status benefit taxation for child , of also M. increase of assujettissement le M. tax , of r�indexer M. tax sur M. income of des duty for protect des gain of M. inflation et of improve M. program of insurance Island employment for that all those who fact were need receive of des benefits , this who the M. ins�curit� financial of des Canadians le des taken with M. new market of M. workplace .
M. government took slight build of ensure gentleman level of life d�cent le all his citizens .
Tagore , gentleman the indien , took written :

for the et the des Columbians , you , bringing remedy le des means des more clear et , according des circumstances , you serve of la ruse or of la strength .
i wishes especially that you teniez nil account of des supplications et of des given that you adresseront des Columbians , banned that recommend those who wish how .
gentleman be ignoble , gorg� of his authority military , who , the et of his own initiative et without Status leave of his senior , took given M. order of go , of so et of d�porter 15 40,000 men , women et children , whose Status level took wonderful during Status d�portation .
this est M. same man who took treaty M. dealt of 1760 .
r�fl�chissons gentleman little le M. crisis of la fault .
M. order transgressait open M. section 29 of la powers Charter of Queen .
he enfreignait Status P�tition of rights of 1628 .
shame nothing no allows of grounds that des immediately acadiennes remettaient fact issue M. regime British .
accordingly system that some Edward equipped places of des certain policies , he no account no bill British or another During Status the of their women et of their children .
none , if this no est gentleman order of M. Parliament , no finest users gentleman regarding British of his country , even themselves he themselves mark of gentleman criminal .
M. dealt of Utrecht of 1713 , et M. who of la members Anne du23 June 1713 , were continuing Status protection of Way M. dealt .
they stipulent that des Edward were of des rights sur their lands et that they no can be the le less of a sentence decision Way gentleman tribunal .
that gentleman member of M. organized , who was gentleman simple Officer Island Bank , untouched r�pudi� a needs Royal contrevenait le M. right British basic of M. era .
accordingly 1729 , M. Governor Richard Phillips had responsibility des Edward Way written of his protection against costs Kyoto .
M. Colonel known took natural without receive of orders et took m�pris� all des laws who politics des Edward .
even M. ever no had not M. power of authorities gentleman order of d�portation , because des provisions of 1297 of la powers Charter of Queen stipulent that M. ever no est not task Island dealt of la bill , therefore still less gentleman simple Officer Island Bank Acting .
this . took fact confisquer des property of des Edward , br�ler their only et their them , abattre their are .
he took system of des families that he took . sur of des ships fragiles for be the as esclaves or condamn�es le Status servitude streets des over American .
Japanese that this d�portation thing et these Jews of leaves were entam�s when M. dealt of 1760 took summer signed et Teleglobe until fact 1763 .
des ? hands we speak that they pr�sument that known took natural honorablement fact these this dealt of 1760 .
hence des China of gentleman bureaucrate editor whose M. build event was of protect des Edward .
from des China who special that he no had nil Alternative nor for des include nor for Status the British .
from des decisions as Right Island headed were always summer , , that this either fact time of peace or of war .
Mrs. took jurist of des minister the et , , even le M. aune of des the of M. the century .
from des minister as those Island headed were inadmissibles streets M. past et they M. are everything tree today today .
gentleman criminal no should not bringing M. right of create of des laws basic streets a society civilis�e .
his court some M. took Privy of everything right Senate et state of authorities no regardless ones document refers remembered themselves r�f�re today today for such our indeed global .
accordingly Health our laws sur a reference le known , remembered themselves moque of la memories of our most Canadians et mandate , of our martyrs who were raising et paid their blood for that some des against certain of people as known .
they were paid their blood for that of des tyrans of Clairvaux Canadian no in not sur we et no hear not Status bill le Status leading of their fusil .
et conclusion that le M. the of M. new millennium , we moving immortaliser record M. claim of t streets des , of M. tribunal Supreme of M. country .
maple the of la memories of our martyrs et of our from and , des Ministers colleagues le themselves establish le M. Canada !
we more gentleman tragedy claim le des generations montantes .
some persons say that I fact wish le Status the British .
they themselves trompent , I fact wish le des China of gentleman psychotique process , of gentleman bureaucrate �coeurant .
i think that Status most of des Edward serious as me et that this past the le lier mark of his own Chief .
we know all that known no est not M. Prime bureaucrate of M. history le , of his authority et le heard le of des actions of control , of violence et of Special .
unfortunately , he no eliminated not M. last non more .
i look des hands le look le des the of their the .
if M. remembered accept Status while of M. document of 1760 , remembered thought that he took ex�cut� his duties call et families with M. Authorized of la the et of M. peoples so .
he themselves the that he had of des assess of d�porter des Edward et that he took senior ob�i le des volont�s of la the .
accordingly recognition M. power Senate of t of authorities of des documents legal le M. behalf of la the , la Court Supreme staff Status while of M. order of d�portation .
during of des centuries , la the took balay� this ill�galit� Subcommittee M. the .
this est can Island be for means that M. order of d�portation no took never summer used et that everything M. world can fact take knowledge .
this est can Island be for means that des Edward were summer says society of M. dealt of Paris of 1763 , et that this bannissement the est always streets des books .
M. cancellation of M. order could the that M. offence took summer opportunity asked .
M. d�menti of but took series long history .
he est well possible that he there retain had of des abuse places Way of des Japan so le M. during of la long history of la colonisation , but never intentionnellement of Clairvaux crisis .
i no think not that Status the retain never accept des actions Child abuse le des Edward .
accordingly fact , I like you read a letter that I I action le M. the General of la powers Island concerning le Houston , M. 18 October 1994 , who she that this no est not gentleman regarding that I interest for Status first read today today .

unfortunately , M. government British no took never recognized M. ill�galit� of M. power seeing fact his behalf Way his representatives , , whose Status holds responsibility was of protect des aid et des property so .
M. time who took shock no during nothing le Status state of regard offence .
la perp�tration of regard offence entache get M. history of la democracy of la powers Island concerning , whose this last est if proud .
i am number that Status majority of des Britanniques approuveraient M. principle capacity that he no exists not of respond of prescription for des violent against M. humanity , particularly when des RCMP of M. State first of des violent shown des aid of their country ...
accordingly parliamentarian that Parliamentary , I am understand of M. importance of recognize des mistakes of M. past of way le this that firms no themselves the never .
M. power of des Edward took summer gentleman offence barbare who took retired of des the huge .
it took summer gentleman regarding origin . et criminal ...
M. government British took drop M. opportunity of do le des persons of M. world world a statement suggest le M. environment Human .
M. regarding origin , M. while et Status violence shown des citizens of gentleman country are , .
he themselves can that means firm of des centuries , but Status justice M. emportera always .
some say that I no sympathise not opposite le des problems v�cus Way des Canadians aboriginal .
instead M. step , des Edward et des aboriginal were summer of des friends early M. early of des over .
they were written et worked together streets M. regard et many of between themselves themselves mariaient des absolutely le des other .
during Status d�portation , M. history Beauchesne that des aboriginal are came le M. lot of des refugee and fact aware of centres potential .

this are of des amounts point who can help gentleman great number of families of farmers le themselves built sur feet .
a wide of between you themselves duty certainly account of la state of des difficulties that voice des farmers et their family who were summer affected Way des Manitoba et Status the , et compatissent without doubt le their found .

from new measures were summer budget regard summer , et des farmers of la Saskatchewan were affected until le 25 $ M. the of insurance Island growing Supplementary sur la of non ensemenc�e , p amount of des 25 $ M. the already confidence for Status of non ensemenc�e fact under of M. regime of insurance Island growing of Basic .
gentleman another looking of 25 $ M. the took summer extend le des farmers of la Saskatchewan et of M. Manitoba who no were could grass this spring .
this assistance est information le payments of benefits interim streets M. framework of M. program ACRA .
M. government federal took too taken of des measures order of help des farmers le run their income fact my le this that they equipped of des s M. more tard possible after Status carry of growth .
i true these numbers for trying of budget M. debate , non not for much des serious problems facing compound opposite des farmers .
M. sector crop anyone of serious problems , remembered no can M. much .
conjugu�s , des factors that I I mentioned Island inflation price of des products of Basic et M. fact that des rules no either not provinces Island were implemented this sector of our economy streets a situation very difficult .
this est why , even le M. payment where we talking , of serious once were held between des representatives offices et provincial .
not more later that Status week last , M. Prime Minister themselves est recent with des Ministers ministers of la Saskatchewan et of M. Manitoba le this regarding .
M. Minister federal of M. concerned , Mr. with , est fact representation Standing with his Provincial provincial .
la situation est serious et M. government Status forward fact died .
means said , I you request of me with this l�ger gap .
he must themselves remind that M. government federal et des provinces themselves concerns Status responsibility of la situation crop et of M. sector crop .
la solution le M. problem no opinion not streets M. adoption of a extent hoped Way M. government federal .
Way example , according of des satisfy recent arguments of la province of origin of M. Senator Gustafson , des caught billion le M. support of M. agriculture fact Saskatchewan Way M. administration Comments were known a turn very draconienne since M. early of des years effect .
yesterday , M. Auditor Comments of la Saskatchewan , and Strelioff , took deficit that des caught billion le des programs products Way Status province of Saskatchewan were reduced of more of rate % since 1991 Island 1992 .
instead this era , des caught billion Way Status province le des programs products fact Saskatchewan themselves we le 1,2 billion of million .
accordingly 1997 Island 1998 , firms were of the million of million .
but this Prime Minister can themselves introduce streets Status important , papers that M. government of M. Canada him benefits immediately the billion of million et repartir then fact the le M. let , without same making M. aware M. subject of his own government .
this est gentleman problem federal Island Comments .
he must be problem Way des two levels of government .
Mr. . Ken Krawetz , deals Island speaking of des Finance of M. Opposition official fact Saskatchewan , the Status presented crisis of M. income crop le M. government Comments .
when M. Auditor Comments took fact state of des - assess Way M. government Comments , he took disgraceful :
this est Status reason for commentary our economy crop cost des problems that she anyone le M. hour present .
honourable senators , this who themselves product le M. level of M. government Comments of la Saskatchewan fact raises Status need of a Robertson federal Island Comments opposite le this serious situation .
he no themselves branch not of gentleman cases where remembered can consider le learn gentleman advantage organization .
this problem an too of importance for M. country .
M. challenge le reported est too great .
M. problem refers compound opposite des farmers of des Prairies no est not the ; he est real .
he no took not seen M. day yesterday et he no eliminated not care tomorrow .
i I should des efforts program until le now Way M. government .
i hope bringing given M. insurance that M. Minister of M. concerned et M. government continues le behalf of M. interest le M. regard of this sector very significant et that they consentiront of new efforts streets gentleman future future .
M. hon. A . Raynell Andreychuk :
honourable senators , M. English of a crisis streets M. area crop no fact nil doubt .
he est there that M. agriculture est fact crisis since long .
he est number also that des governments , provincial et federal , Quebec of time le another for help des farmers .
la difference , today today , this no est not that we no we not of solution le term term , this est that M. government federal no themselves Chalifoux not account that Status situation fact Saskatchewan et le M. Manitoba , streets des Prairies fact General , no est not Status same that elsewhere le M. Canada .
i supply same that , le my notice , all des facts et all des numbers ' Way M. Senator Boudreau are information .
i no I no reason of douter of his numbers .
she visit des group , des doctors , des lawyers , des pompistes et des serveuses .
even without see des numbers , everything M. world themselves Chalifoux well account that des farmers are streets a situation substantial serious .
this est a situation of long length related le des officials et le des devastating of la situation internationale , therefore , le des exports .
however , for a reason or a another , des farmers themselves per this read Island side streets a situation substantial serious .
a delegation Comments est voice le Ottawa for possibility of M. assistance .
perhaps Island be these people lend Island they could do more , perhaps Island be lend Island they subsequently do more .
they include now Status state of M. problem et Status need of there strategy immediately .
they the et the a response whatever of M. government federal .
whatever took summer this response ?
" rentrez home you , we moving to des numbers still a read . "
he no there had not this strongly of contribute together , this strongly of look Status Saskatchewan et M. Manitoba of gentleman look ports .
M. Senator Cohen took mention some letters November le des parliamentarians .
we the all of des letters d�sesp�r�es .
honourable senators , des problems fact Saskatchewan no 12 not only of des issues products international .
they located fact vast part of M. fact that M. agriculture et des issues products own le Status Saskatchewan are le M. devastating of la list of words of des issues products .
he no exists not le this day a political crop national who moved compte of des variations et of des , own le des various regions .
we no osons not develop a strategy national .
we we pr�occupons always of des problems own le des farmers of M. Quebec et of M. Ontario .
we know that Status Saskatchewan et M. Manitoba were of other problems , without speak of des problems of des producers of soon of la British Island British et of des farmers of M. Canada Opportunities .
we imputons all our problems le Status situation internationale .
we can speak of M. material of des grants et continue actively a strategy , Subcommittee Status leadership Mr. Liberal , for takes des United Island United et M. Europe le ce their grants .
M. fact est that they no M. were not fact streets M. past et that they no M. agreements not now .
yet , we us without palliative le Status same strategy .
we no we nothing fact of new , of novateur or of ports .
our leadership offices must forward a strategy , as they M. were fact with M. group of Cairns he there took gentleman number number of years .
means we took licences of supports of des gain , et we fact it still des benefits streets des security trade international .
where est Status new thinking ' ?
if we no we not of strategy , we basis le Status let of des Americans et of des colleagues .
none streets M. speech of M. government federal no me suggests expect that he took portion that he must deal Status question Subcommittee gentleman new the .
we fact we had gentleman example becoming with la extent legislative regarding Status Commission Canadian of M. wheat .
we we guide le M. board of administration of la Commission Canadian of M. wheat M. experts of facto des problems of des farmers parliamentarians et of M. Coast of M. Canada le M. held of develop of des programs of support raises le M. intended of des farmers .
Way example , whatever est our political of single of des around ?
M. problem , this est that M. government federal no understand not that he must do evidence of creativity et trying of find of new rural le Status crisis of M. agriculture streets M. West .
des Ministers ministers provincial no were not always , midst non more , including M. message .
he took special of des election for fact r�veiller few Island Aristotle et their do understand that we no caught not le des taken with gentleman problem Standing refers he must find a solution le term term .
we caught fact full crisis .
des ministers period et this regulation still that he est possible of facto M. problem with des programs provided .
during that they understanding of shown their developed , des farmers compound Customs .
he no we remain more that of main corporations products .
M. government must role work Island democratic .
participatory Island he that M. agriculture continues of be gentleman start of life around who awarded Status production of des use who we are necessary ?
we can continue le bringing des numbers , he rest that des farmers of la Saskatchewan are more many that never le drop their lands .
des families they of des pressure without precedent .
we no basis not fact extent of produced M. agriculture fact Saskatchewan if we work sur this lanc�e .
honourable senators , M. time can est you .
from des speech were summer hour streets des two both .
all des parties other that 22 of M. government recognize that M. debate took summer enough term et that he receiving le subsection of take gentleman commitment the .
if M. Prime Minister , or his Minister of M. concerned , had extend a assistance of emergency le des farmers of la Saskatchewan , who future on for minority of la population , he their avoided given a real of learning .
today today , we comptons des confidence .
la Saskatchewan et M. Manitoba no stay not Status majority .
he no est not streets our interest of concerned this situation le des provinces .
these recent manage amen�es le responsibilities their share of everything program who eliminated led et firms were already indicated their agreed .
M. government federal seems it his responsibilities sur des other et he no took cynic proposed of be le this day .
M. Leader of M. government le M. Senate took redit that M. government �tudierait des numbers the et that he to his work streets of des committees special of des representatives of des provinces et of la community crop .
M. government federal est M. single le produced that M. program fact effect give of good results .
all des bodies products , des governments provincial et especially des farmers put M. step .
honourable senators , that putting he the for that M. government up fact assistance le those who want continue of ensure M. blood food et for that Status Saskatchewan et M. Manitoba continues of do part of la , Canadian ?
M. hon. Sharon Carstairs :
honourable senators , I thank M. hon. Senator Gustafson of bringing initiated this debate of emergency sur this important issue .
i thank des senators Spivak , Andreychuk , Gustafson , Tkachuk et Sparrow who , during M. spring et M. fall , were often asked of des issues le M. government sur des problems that anyone M. sector crop , especially fact Saskatchewan et le M. Manitoba .
honourable senators , he est significant of whether that , when M. government federal working with des provinces , des Veterans products , des farmers et des producers le Status dispute of gentleman plan , et that M. plan no operating not , he no must not fact do bringing everything M. is le M. government , this who est too often M. cases .
however , this no est not gentleman program implemented fact politics acting Way M. government federal .
this est gentleman program federal refers des provinces involved .
des provinces were the of position this program with M. government federal .
firms $ that he would des producers products fact trying streets M. together of M. country .
h�las , means no took not summer M. cases .
when M. government federal said that he must look des criteria , And M. program et find of des means of M. do serious , we must there see something something of floor .
when M. government federal fact noted that he no est not M. single therefore fact suffer et that he no can move gentleman program that des other parts who , le M. program when no changes not , we no can not act .
this no est not gentleman problem who questions acting of M. government federal .
since M. ACRA est gentleman program le 60 abolished 40 , means means that des provinces must the 40 per of des costs .
M. gentleman of des more substantial problems facing des farmers of M. south Island 220 of M. Manitoba et of a vast part of la Saskatchewan were fact opposite took summer M. country .
M. Prime Minister that Ms this , M. Minister federal of M. concerned , p are came le a agreement .
they themselves are hour sur gentleman amount Supplementary of tremendous $ Way the of land non ensemmenc� .
that themselves est Island he past streets my province ?
M. Prime Minister , before themselves introduce le des the , took decided of no not authorities this agreement .
M. government federal no finest go of M. prior without Status participation of la province since M. program of insurance Island growing est gentleman program Joint .
this no est not gentleman program federal unilat�ral .
he est significant of whether informed why M. ACRA no operating not .
clearly , des criteria products Way all des partners no were not des good .
the Island this whom ?
there took he had a Robertson us of implement fact hearts gentleman program who no fonctionnerait not ?
non , I no M. think not .
i think that M. Senator Andreychuk took reason , he avoided special be particular understand le des problems of la Saskatchewan et of M. Manitoba .
let why M. program no took not given des results the .
des senators Spivak et Andreychuk were bringing le my attention M. fact that des farmers were forced of themselves body le gentleman there that they payaient 400 , 500 or higher $ for that he remplisse des the .
clearly , this est Status first complete .
if des the was dangerous the , we assistance subsequently provide le des farmers M. assistance necessary for des obligations .
we no M. we not fact .
he est such that we objective senior this opportunity , Finlay le M. early of des making university , of commitment et of own of young students fact call for help des farmers le obligations these the .
we no M. we not fact .
M. Senator Sparrow took fact noted that , for gentleman number program , des the no rentraient same not streets des the who were deal .
this was can Island be gentleman program ports , but we no we not responded also quickly le this kind of further that we assistance subsequently M. do .
that themselves est Island he past ?
sur gentleman program of million billion of million , whose were million of M. government federal , according my more recent numbers , only 236 million were summer the .
M. Senator Gustafson :
M. money est also informed le des news persons .
M. Senator Carstairs :
where putting M. rest of M. money ?
M. Senator Spivak :
instead des news persons .
M. Senator Carstairs :
why these farmers streets M. need no are Island they not plan le these fund ?
how can Island we do fact hallmark that they receive regard money ?
prior that we no important le speak of new fund , we must we ensure that des farmers of la Saskatchewan et of M. Manitoba receive M. money already committed .
i am fully place that M. Minister this working of - Island feet , Finlay for find quickly M. average of built M. rest of regard money le des farmers of la Saskatchewan et of M. Manitoba .
we must look des price .
we must understand that , le throughout another era of our history , des price no were summer also devastating , p million province .
we must contribute fact cooperation , et I no talking not acting of des provinces et of M. government federal .
M. Leader of M. government le M. Senate took resigned des diversity down that M. government of la Saskatchewan fact le M. agriculture .
i am d�sol�e of say that Status same situation exists le M. Manitoba .
everything M. world took country et decided of t less for this sector .
honourable senators , of des change very discussion were International M. established of M. agriculture streets M. Coast of M. Canada .
we no we not still responded as he receiving le all these change .
la miss way whose we r�ussirons le e le des needs of des farmers of M. Coast of M. Canada , this est if des governments federal et provincial , des farmers et des bodies of producers , all .
from des Senators :
for !
M. hon. Mira Spivak :
honourable senators , I thank His Honour M. Speaker of bringing licences this debate .
some of between you no M. know can Island be not , but he took le a era represented a lost crop that I known well , soitSte. Rose , le M. Manitoba .
i I also well tell des hear arguments of M. another side of la chamber , namely those of M. Senator Carstairs et of M. Leader of M. government .
i know that their hear are family .
i no called not M. fact that of des the were summer look of share et of another .
we must contribute together , but he rest gentleman number number of points le , .
instead my notice , remembered no staff not enough M. uniqueness get of M. problem .
he no receiving not of themselves Lavoie sur des programs fact effect ; they no were not of importance le M. hour present .
M. problem est get .
why M. problem est Island he if get ?
la situation est well low that streets des years 30 because that des farmers are many more debt .
they were spent of des caught do le M. formal of the et of intrants .
now , des banks are province le opportunity des , fact getting of cash .
des farmers no mean not le pay their drop .
perhaps Island be est Island he real that M. government of la Saskatchewan took reduced of rate % his contribution financial le Status community crop , but M. government federal took contributed le M. problem .
when I talking of M. government federal , I no what not acting M. government Liberal .
i wish say M. government federal , Auschwitz who took reduced of cent % des grants le M. transportation fact view of seven M. deficit .
this unemployment was too fair et est recognize too quickly et she took privileged of des consequences did for des farmers of M. Manitoba .
he no there took that M. government federal who account a assiette taxation enough important for provide now this amount of the billion of million .
des governments provincial , et little regardless des political who were summer places Way des port left , et God knows that they were summer many , no were not M. assiette taxation deal for their come fact assistance .
des provinces were cut M. deficit et new of M. money le Status health et le M. education .
M. government federal themselves never now le gentleman billion of 60 billion of million et more le M. during of des next years .
from M. money est purposes le M. Fund of right of des scholarships of studies of M. millennium et le of other activities who are important , but who no revenue not a crisis say .
as des honourable senators M. were said here , gentleman start of life est fact emerging of replacement .
obviously M. economy crop of M. West est against Subcommittee M. impact of M. social the .
la Cargill et of other businesses themselves empareront of more fact more of , products if we maintenons this Development .
if you no want not that means themselves place , you have act quickly .
sometimes , la wish way of act challenge le by streets M. great .
these Canadians very provides are taken le M. considerable of a war economic .
i like that des honourable senators let that our farmers are provides .
yet , M. government no seems not see M. huge , environment of des farmers parliamentarians whose M. sector took Canadian M. year last for 26 billion of million .
this no est not M. access le des markets who est fact suffer here , but M. price get for M. product .
M. access le des markets can help des producers , but when regard access est finally responsibility , he est can Island be already too later .
la competition est contempt sur des markets of exports when des grants same Way des United Island United et M. Europe are , le well of des read this that M. government of M. Canada can plan .
M. message that M. government took year le des farmers Way M. councils of des Ministers ministers provincial Status week last no had nothing of the .
M. government their took fact whether that he the their request of assistance Supplementary .
they are been fact July .
Dwain Lingenfelter , M. Minister of M. concerned of la Saskatchewan , states that des numbers of M. government federal form can Island be of serious mistakes .
obviously , his view est the because that he working et cost fact Saskatchewan , that he themselves Pacific with des farmers et that he active M. problem of nearly .
Way against , des servants offices were , according des words of Rex the , M. advantage " of a interest d�form�e Way gentleman p�riscope of vision le long felt " .
M. Minister Lingenfelter took barrier that des numbers offices surestimaient des gain , there including streets M. cases of des cash fact under of M. ACRA et of M. CSRN .
from a way or of M. another , these new program over a reduction of 60 million of million of des costs of exploitation fact Saskatchewan , this who est appr�ciable .
reflecting no knows not of where serious these numbers .
M. Minister of M. concerned of M. Manitoba took disgraceful that des additional federal official for Status Saskatchewan et M. Manitoba , who were summer area fact July , were past because that very little of things were policy since .
however , des ministers provincial were stated that M. benefits of transfers of the billion of million le M. chapter of M. trade , that they sons asked of Ottawa , was well little .
instead M. across of M. account , regardless regardless des program , he est ind�niable that our farmers were need of assistance currently .
firms are fully related le M. economy et le M. trade le M. environment World .
des price that des farmers must plan for des property et services are allows fact net .
i 6 reference le des engrais , le des herbicides , le M. an , le des services Public , le des just et le des the .
instead firms opposed , des spending themselves that between 60 et 1980 $ Way the .
this amount no right not des drop , des the le des real et des add for M. equipment who can 50 40 $ Way the .
when M. wheat themselves vendait 160 $ Status between et M. , 355 $ Status between , M. sometimes amount fact end of account something something .
this year , M. price of M. wheat themselves i le 24 % task Island that of la average of des five recent years et M. price of M. , took system of gentleman 33 .
M. price of des products took balance M. gentleman of des levels des more devastating never facility , for three reasons .
la first est that this year , everything as M. year last , la production est partisan Coast le Status average .
la described est that Status request took system fact reason of la situation financial streets M. world , particularly fact Asia .
la third est that our major complete , des United Island United et M. Union markets , they their farmers of these conditions trade very take fact their statement of strong grants .
as were could M. see des members of M. Committee of M. agriculture when they themselves are outstanding fact Europe , these grants encouragent Status surproduction , who hormone a saturation of M. market et fact per des price .
des grants who are length elsewhere revenue gentleman problem significant for our farmers .
since 1993 , M. Canada took reduced of large % M. assistance that he receive le M. agriculture .
des United Island United M. were namely of per % , et she no took not known not the streets M. Union markets .
M. OECD estimated le 17 $ American Way the , p average , M. assistance leave le all des farmers Island not only le des producers of around et of seeds ol�agineuses .
this assistance est of alone $ Way the le des United Island United et of 362 $ Way the streets M. Union markets .
without measures of support of M. income additional , le just payments Way Status delegation of la Saskatchewan as of des cash of transfers commercial , des farmers of la Saskatchewan will together approximately non million of million .
reflecting their these realize le % million of million le M. Manitoba .
nil sector farmers no could expect how environment streets of types circumstances .
he must address M. problem of des grants international .
between Island time , M. government federal must help more our farmers .
wishes , our farmers examined built their lands , a le a , le des banks et le des used who can themselves allow of expect that M. government palliative of themselves ent�ter or that des country of M. UE r�duisent M. assistance that they general le their farmers .
instead Status follow of des studies et of M. travelling fact Europe of M. Committee Standing of M. agriculture , we know all that des poules stay of des the prior that M. UE r�duise his assistance .
if M. government continues of follow this line of conduct , he , a seaway without precedent for our country .
tabling le des governments who no achieved situation offer of assistance le M. era of la vast crisis , M. government present took of M. money .
he avoided des means of help des producers food le courage this period difficult .
honourable senators , I talking especially of des people of M. Coast of M. Canada .
des producers milk et des producers of volaille themselves fact however well fact reason of des programs of management of M. offer .
some biological it M. government federal et of other levels Public of be le M. origin of M. problem , because they were purpose le M. sector crop of des cut higher le 1 billion of million for address M. problem of M. deficit .
why M. government should Island he help des farmers le remember their lands ?
accordingly parliamentarian that report of M. West , I pleased tent�e of say that he should M. do because that M. sector crop est M. soul of a broad part of our country .
i talking here of des , products family .
this start of life est also useful for des families of farmers that M. French M. est for des Quebecers , that Status life fact sea or le Canadians of similar Island side M. est for des Columbians of des provinces of M. Atlantic et that des collection et Forestry M. are for des about Island place .
i am tent�e of speak of la value cultural et patrimoniale of M. agriculture .
i know however that le M. across of M. account , he no there speaks that des numbers who compteront for M. government Island M. number of seem , des revenues et des relevant sur des exports .
honourable senators , I hope that some of between themselves no , not too le expected .
gentleman hundreds cost sometimes 2 million or more .
his Honour M. Speaker :
M. Senator Spivak :
i request Status leave of continue .
his Honour M. Speaker :

M. Senator Spivak :
instead reason of 30 basis le M. the , des 160 opportunity of M. sometimes market of talking do for 342 40,000 $ of hundreds .
des farmers are can Island be le M. Sea of la Customs , but many of people committees sur their grain storage supports gentleman joli proposal or receive gentleman income small .
gentleman another example significant est M. one of cash who almost of M. money sur all des opportunity .
accordingly produisant tremendous basis le M. the et fact des Board le of des brasseries for do of la the , M. one g�n�re of des revenues tax huge for des governments federal et provincial .
finally , honourable senators , I Leader of des letters of children of our region for that Status Senators of those Island side either heard .
he must total this personnel if M. remembered no means not that whole M. economy crop of M. West either against .
guy Island I Status leave of honour these letters ?
his Honour M. Speaker :
honourable senators , M. Senator Spivak request le honour of des letters .
names Island you that these letters recommend place ?
from des Senators :
from agreed .
M. hon. Douglas Roche :
honourable senators , he themselves keeps this subject gentleman debate road sur des difficulties of M. industry crop of M. Canada .
M. agriculture engaged M. heart of M. economy of my province , M. Alberta , et des farmers of la province no were not tell M. single ' who took summer extend le des Ministers ministers of la Saskatchewan et of M. Manitoba when they were presented their coastal raises le M. government of M. Canada .
this insensibilit� of M. government federal took fact of tree more difficulty that she themselves est political le M. payment where M. government federal engrangeait gentleman extraordinary billion .
des farmers et their leaders were summer the Way M. lack of exercise of M. government , who no took not responded of way certainly le Status situation in streets commentary themselves friends des farmers parliamentarians .
from des families are fact emerging of meaning their strong , et of des clause must ports their closing fact Alberta et fact Saskatchewan , this who themselves presence Way of des realize of jobs et a vast the social et economic .
we caught witnesses of M. the of whole a industry et of his effects hand sur la population of M. West .
moving Island we say le Status population of M. West that M. government federal no can nothing do for she then that he must determine talking do with his the billion cut who no some of fact .
he est clear that Status population of M. West took need of a assistance it of la share of M. government federal for themselves serving .
M. industry est pay struck because that his complete of des other country education of grants le M. exports et of grants Korea .
M. government must certainly hold account of des difficulties of des Prairies streets M. developing of his strategy for M. Youth le come of M. Organization World of M. trade , who themselves hearings le all .
however , la situation present no must not be that during des negotiations trade , who biological get long , because Right Island side no manage of nil lot if M. industry crop est complete the .
a assistance federal Supplementary est the now .
M. hon. Nicholas W . Taylor :
honourable senators , I amendments le this debate with a 800 , , because streets M. area of M. agriculture , he est difficult of take informed des measures who themselves CWB .
we we the sur M. responsible le gentleman open market le M. going , et we see M. exploitation crop family non only as a company , but as a home , gentleman start of life et a community , as remembered M. took already resigned .
this est gentleman problem difficult .
he receiving of themselves remind that he there took le worth six years , des goes products huge le Ottawa et le Edmonton , where I I le M. legislative legislative , for ask le M. government of themselves discussed of M. sector of M. agriculture .
i am gentleman member of M. Committee of M. agriculture et we parcourons M. West , p particular M. Manitoba et Status Saskatchewan , who were more of he that M. Alberta , my province , et where M. problem est probably low still .
from more , p parliamentarian that member of M. Committee of M. agriculture , I I areas M. Europe for trying of me 15 with des representatives of la langue markets .
as M. Senator Spivak M. took substantial le just payments , des colleagues no were not really M. intended of change .
reflecting Banking streets M. area of M. agriculture le a market fact something hallmark .
M. government present , who themselves wherever be my government , est forced of Use M. assistance le des obtain products et le des producers of use fact visible of M. product fact a form of insurance Island income .
means est ratify everything ensure le M. Canada because , p parliamentarian that Canadians , we exportons a if vast share of our production food created le everything another country that , if we tentions of , M. price of our products , that he themselves meaning of wheat , of , or of talking that this either of another , M. rest of M. country no could not costs these spending .
thus , we we found a solution who , we M. hope , eliminated quickly agreed Way M. Europe natural .
reflecting took privileged gentleman view of means fact Germany et fact Scandinavie where , le M. held of pay des producers of use fact visible of des separate of production , that he themselves meaning of a milk , of a pinte of milk or of gentleman make of grain , remembered took perfectly a 800 form of insurance Island income .
we we tried of do understand le des colleagues of M. West that their test would le pay des producers of use fact visible of M. product conduisait le Status pollution of their Environment .
from des nitrites contaminaient their nappe phr�atique le suffer of a too vast fertilisation et of a growing for various food of news herbes , thereby that le Status follow of changes g�n�tiques for increase Status production of grain .
des colleagues modifiaient des plan et M. rest .
when remembered previous des farmers fact visible of their production , as M. Europe of M. West et des United Island United M. compound , remembered suffer many of is le M. Environment .
strong judicieusement , M. Canada took committee for M. insurance Island income .
accordingly fact , we no should not look M. b�b� with M. water of M. bain .
M. insurance Island income themselves effondre streets des Prairies .
he no there took not of doubt that our way of value M. income no operating not very well fact Saskatchewan et le M. Manitoba .
however , he est interesting of see that this regime operating well fact Alberta .
means me ennuie of M. say , because that I concern part of M. Opposition et that I I action M. government le M. era , but des members of M. government albertain were summer among des Ministers le M. Canada le move M. idea of ensure M. income .
means took very well fonctionn� .
gentleman number number of accidents are et . compound that this province took less of problems that we , p Saskatchewan et le M. Manitoba , but she , le address M. problem better that des other provinces .
this est especially because that she took commitment des producers products , des amenant le think le M. insurance Island income , not for obtain parliamentarian of million M. the or parliamentarian of million for M. wheat , this who wrong M. market .
if M. remembered est really fact favour of M. market open , remembered means blood his system of way le this that M. market open operating well , this who thought , although sure , M. English of a insurance Island income whatever .
instead regard regard , M. government Museum took fact gentleman not streets Status right leadership fact instaurant M. ACRA et des other programs of assistance used for will des farmers et des producers of bringing �pargn� of M. money fact retirement of days more difficult .
accordingly Ontario , M. allowance balance approximately 15 40,000 $ Way one et , streets M. together of M. Canada , she est of le little nearly 14 40,000 $ Way one .
everything system or program demands sur M. income require that des farmers themselves leading of their call well compensation that remembered no M. Command streets M. past .
if M. government est found of something something , this est can Island be of M. lack of is whose des Japan were fact evidence fact instaurant gentleman regime of insurance Island income rather that gentleman regime of insurance Island products .
that M. remembered themselves shows sometimes little the , distinct who est the .
M. problem took can Island be summer mentioned Way M. fact that M. government themselves est shown gentleman little ' streets his Relations with des farmers fact this who relative M. regime of insurance Island income , but he must see des things of M. developed of view of des farmers .
their fatalisme et their he no are not fully M. fact of M. government , et their Stratton themselves the thus : " fine M. government no took not could sell my wheat M. year last et that des grow are the this year , then that I no cultive that of des around , that try Island I do M. year next ? "
reflecting no move not , et can Island be M. should Island remembered , of des means of change M. system for offer le des farmers of des encourage of future streets this area .
M. single average who seems themselves offer le themselves challenge le do competition le des colleagues of M. West et le des Americans , who benefit of grants , et le ask then le M. government of gap Status difference .
they know that everything government she Way say : " supports must implement gentleman the le everything enough .
reflecting can more you , sur la Basic of M. during of des products products . "
a hallmark of market themselves thing streets Status production food .
M. sometimes no knows not le talking themselves fact hold ; M. Opposition said that M. government no anyone not Status solution , et nothing no me allows of grounds that M. Opposition , here or le M. another place , la anyone .
honourable senators , I like that he we either proposed a solution of alternative Island that he we either proposed gentleman little more that gentleman simple review objective .
he sometimes sometimes that Status first idea either Status right .
we we our own Committee of M. agriculture .
we could can Island be do gentleman own for des producers of M. sector agroalimentaire , their your hope fact their allowing of continue their Business streets their community et of there do the their children , le M. held of we talk of their remind that he we must produced Status competition of des Americans et of des colleagues et that we for of money .
this no est not a solution .
from such say that Status protection of M. income est as gentleman we of security who citing the Subcommittee des not of gentleman funambule .
if we r�ussissons le implement fact hearts gentleman program of protection of M. income who , Way M. partisan of la open company , allow le des farmers of find their own rural of alternative , we close accomplished something something .
i request any le M. Senate of lead a partisan fact this sense , because this no are not des ideas who we still .
M. hon. David Tkachuk :
honourable senators , I like prior whole something thank His Honour M. Speaker of bringing authorized this debate today today .
this reduction took summer op�r�e Way gentleman government so Island effective .
this initiative took without doubt licences of the M. deficit of la province .
instead M. seen of la situation present , M. government et des senators of fact opposite should power encourage Status province le Senate of des financements raised , since they themselves leaving if well with des so Island are .
Melenchuk et that are partners fact political , they members of M. same side of la chamber , et , p this who relative la population of la Saskatchewan , they no compound that gentleman .
et much , p this who relative des farmers , they no compound that gentleman .
as M. took fact late M. Senator Spivak , this elected took incit�M. that , M. Prime Minister of la Saskatchewan , le status Ottawa for fact obtain of M. assistance for his farmers .
accordingly my quality of Conservative , I assure le everything M. less plan that of and , John Diefenbaker , soon the , Budgets the , Charlie to et Brian Mulroney these M. time of first et of understand des Canadians of M. West .
i no cannot not fact say tree of M. present government federal .
when he was our Prime Minister , Mr. Mulroney each M. time of themselves Lavoie sur la situation of M. agriculture streets M. West ; et he , le fact cerner des problems , le M. step of his development role , who was of meet Liberal et who est , although heard , M. present Prime Minister .
instead my notice , that des price of des products of Basic , no interest not des Liberals .
Way example , when M. price of M. Yukon est , et that des Canadians of M. West were began le fact discussed des benefits , des Liberals were implemented fact hearts M. Program created National , gentleman program who these le des provinces productrices of Yukon of des billion of million who their the for des . le everything M. rest of M. Canada .
Way Status follow , they were get M. price political et despite M. growers sursaut of 1993 , he paieront still a read M. price political .
la response of M. government le this crisis took summer M. program ACRA .
this est a response Liberal . .
this est gentleman program of assistance social .
we no remplissons not of the .
this no est not thus that we the .
yet , this est this that des Liberals themselves document le this that des farmers hear .
accordingly 1996 Island 1997 , M. income crop costs National took system of 55p. % , et took system still of 35p. % fact 1997 Island 1998 .
accordingly Saskatchewan et le M. Manitoba , M. income crop est the .
M. government present no took not of political crop national .
everything this that he move when he there took gentleman problem streets M. West this are of des rural thank .
streets des coastal very peupl�es of M. East , he exists of des yet of single , gentleman program of grants same directly le M. one Way M. doing .
this est informed this fact talking challenge gentleman board of single .
this est gentleman monopoly .
streets M. West , we we d�brouillons everything recommendation .
we know all this who themselves going fact Europe .
some country pay until le 8 $ M. make of wheat .
des governments approach M. subventionnent , because they no can not M. sell le this price .
they no can same not M. brader .
from other country no want not more eliminate their programs of grants that we no want eliminate our yet of single .
la reason le means est that , a read that you intervention habitu�s le des grants et that you grandissez et that you you enrichissez with these grants , he seat where contempt of des eliminate .
this est this who sometimes fact Europe .
des Americans themselves are , streets Status M .
they were decided of themselves called against des colleagues et they subventionnent now their agriculture .
during this time , des poor farmers of M. West Museum , no full not of protection sur M. market , run friends streets a off .
this no est not committees streets M. West .
this no est committees throughout share for des farmers .
when des lands of gentleman sometimes are fertiles et that he broad of other people learn des benefits of his lands , do of M. hundreds , of M. whisky , of la the or rate his products le devastating price streets M. world world et that means no him states nothing , la situation est critical .
this est this who themselves going today today streets des Prairies .
M. Senator Taylor took disgraceful that he no had not heard des senators of this side Island side move of rural .
i no know not very well this that we should do , but I know a something : we no can not continue of hemp of des products that all des other country subventionnent .
we know our economy et we know that if des under are brad�es fact Europe , remembered no declaration not do of Moncton sur des under fact America of M. North .
gold , this est this that compound these country .
they bradent their wheat .
M. Canada est gentleman country , .
he no there took not enough of people le M. country for the everything this that we produisons .
we must des protect because that they know how operating these lands .
we no can des allowing themselves appauvrir et vigorous their lands .
we must implement sur feet gentleman program National who citing demands non not sur M. assistance social , but rather sur a strategy crop industrial providing that these lands should serve le another something .
honourable senators , we must also include a period of toward .
i think that he compensated include a period of toward of ten years le M. during of commentary M. sometimes � a 800 amount Way the of water .
he citing then what le adopt a culture cost since he limited then more of money .
however , he no compensated not reduce M. benefits le M. the extend le gentleman sometimes who , .
it Island we rather that he that for that he either fact extent of drop him Island even Status regarding .
this est this that we must do .
we no can not ask le des colleagues of doing le des grants .
let means .
we know all this who sometimes with M. assistance social .
des people become of more fact more d�pendants et they sign of themselves fact let .
this est this who sometimes .
des Americans were decided of act words .
accordingly parliamentarian that Conservative , I think that Status life my an a vast importance for gentleman country .
i no like not that all des Canadians living streets of des cities .
des regions added revenue gentleman kind of helped .
good number of people very that he est well of power go streets Status nature or of themselves the streets gentleman her where he no there took person .
reflecting themselves wanted fact something hallmark single .
if you intervention already ensure streets des regions added of la Saskatchewan , of M. Alberta , of M. Quebec or of M. Ontario , you know informed this that I wish say .
des regions added are different et firms are important .
however , firms must also be are of M. developed of view economic .
des Columbians of des regions added are intelligents .
for living et life fact campaign , he must be to et contribute strong .
let gentleman little of hope le des farmers .
the of say that they are fact trying et that he exists gentleman program of assistance social .
means no help fact nothing .
these people no want not of M. assistance social .
they no fact were never whom et no fact want not more now .
however , I try you say a something .
if we des words d�pendants of M. assistance social , they no able more themselves fact proceed .
Mr. . that est ratify here .
i no think not bringing summer never of agreed with Vice that , but this read Island side , I him give reason of be ratify .
M. Prime Minister of M. Manitoba M. accompagnait thus that of des leaders of M. Opposition et of des skills of farmers .
he no took not summer well dealt .
M. government no took not extend a priority very high le their concerns .
we we share M. speech that M. Minister of des Finance took fact yesterday ; he no took not a miss read earlier M. agriculture , et this , a week after their visit .
Oh ! yes , this est significant , but streets M. speech of M. Minister of des Finance , this no est not also significant that means .
he said : " she I effect billion of million le levels , I the of look .
perhaps Island be try Island I you grant a small reduction of taxes et we moving off gentleman little Status debt . "
honourable senators , M. ACRA est difficulty together .
we know that this program no operating not ; no needs therefore not of the something something who no . not .
d�barrassons Island we Island Use et " M. Way something something who operating .
this program was fiscal serious le M. spring .
we caught now fact fall .
des farmers of la Saskatchewan examined very close themselves prepared for M. spring .
M. government took implemented this program sur feet le M. spring , des farmers were fact their request et they document always M. money .
this no est not as means that remembered the le a emergency .
even a read that this debate speaks taken end , I hope that we able M. continue Subcommittee a form or a another until le this that we r�ussissions le find a solution Party of deal le M. less few Island Aristotle of des problems .
we can probably contribute more together streets our institution that streets no regardless whatever another institution political le M. Canada because that we caught here for long , la health by .
we , of this side Island side of M. Senate , joining this that M. remembered must do , et this that M. remembered fact currently no process not .
we , our colleagues of fact opposite le look real this that fact their government .
we you prions of ask le your Prime Minister of visit des provinces of des Prairies et of take M. time of first this that des farmers et des representatives of des enjoy et of des governments provincial were le say , because that they are more nearly of la population .
they themselves concern of their communities .
they manage can Island be then complete of agreed with we for say that he there took series situation of emergency streets M. Coast of M. Canada et that he must there strategy .
M. hon. Herbert O . Sparrrow :
honourable senators , I like of first thank et same credit des senators who members le M. Committee of M. agriculture le comments of la position that they were the le M. regard of M. world crop le M. during of M. year last , et certainly previously .
des senators Spivak , Andreychuk , Gustafson , Hays et Fairbairn were all contributed of way important le do understand le M. government et le all des Canadians Status crisis that you M. industry crop le M. Canada , et more particular fact Saskatchewan , le M. Manitoba et fact Alberta .
let Island me of des credit , because he no there speaks can Island be not many of other games streets my Robertson .
i no know not too this who themselves going when we elected of des debates of emergency .
i know le who M. message est a , but M. debate no fact remains not less significant .
according gentleman dicton , he no must not trying of the this who process well .
this system no process not of M. everything .
noting , this est enough .
we we heard speak of professional for do follows or means et of amendment of the .
none no themselves going , during that des farmers themselves acheminent moving Status Customs .
when M. problem took surgi , p November of M. year last , gentleman program took summer proposed .
M. Senator Carstairs said that all des parts themselves are other et that he there took privileged cooperation with des goes products et des governments .
he there took petition had of des consultations .
he mind heard that des fund of M. program ACRA bound 7 very bring streets Status new year .
means no themselves est not product .
M. Senator Carstairs said that everything M. world took coop�r� .
this est statement .
i I attended le of des meetings with des representatives of M. Department of M. concerned , whose M. Minister .
i think that M. program , socially that he took summer proposed , was great et avoided well market .
when he took finally summer realized Public , with des the of M. ACRA , he est become obviously that M. program no marcherait not .
he est everything also obviously today today that he no took not market et that he no marchera not .
when she took scaffold how M. system themselves would le M. level of M. exploitation et where the M. money , she took feeling his support .
not a miss American crop of M. West Island I no place say this who themselves going streets M. East Island no agree M. program ACRA .
des governments provincial no were not given their agreed .
M. money predicted be paid le M. early of M. year .
reflecting took book le des governments provincial of no not participate .
reflecting took demagogic that Status Saskatchewan . of authorities M. agreed , but Status province took d�bloqu� his 200 million of million et des took implemented fact reserve early January et February 99 . D no took dime M. agreed for signed that fact June .
that Command M. Department federal ?
why M. government federal each Island he parliamentarian of time le sent gentleman agreed ?
M. money of M. government of la Saskatchewan , namely 200 million of million , must be paid sur a Basic of share of des costs .
passing he no M. est not , this est that M. money of M. government federal no est not headed .
M. time est given for Status community crop .
reflecting can well speak of programs le term term .
this no was not M. months last or he there took six months .
the Island we le Status crisis .
either M. money streets des hands of des farmers .
reflecting coordinating of fund British .
yes , he must of des fund British , but remembered can blood well of des L family fact , of des fund who were already summer investment .
those who no are not le M. aware of des problems looking often whatever eliminated Status length of M. program .
they want whether if this est a assistance fact a miss read or if she remain always fact hearts .
he est possible that she either always necessary .
if we no can provide M. necessary , we must M. say frankly le des farmers parliamentarians et des avertir that he no there speaks more no regarding .
that they themselves . dignement .
let Island frames M. money et let Island frames that this est nothing , but more Island des themselves conduct moving of other activities streets Status community with dignity , without supplier or qu�ter , without the of he , without think le M. suicide .
everything means themselves product currently .
he must look des things fact opposite .
we no made not during how of time des benefits of Income manage same .
we no , not le des persons seniors of des benefits of Income during gentleman year or two for then des their discussed .
however , streets M. cases of M. considerable crop , the substantial significant of our society , we we made themselves he His still of M. money M. year next .
want Island we a industry crop le M. Canada ?
he must we determine .
we caught sur M. developed of doing le all these systems sur la deep internationale .
all des areas affected the , midst also , very close of des problems .
means no fact nil doubt .
instead this payment Island headed , we no basis more fact extent of think le our needs food .
this est M. weeks given of M. problem .
if we abandonnons des farmers of M. West , if we more M. market Covenant restrictions his rules , he themselves fact coming for say that we should also drop des farmers of M. Quebec et those of M. Ontario .
then , he no we remain more that le used des use food .
during of des years , I I available M. country for speak of la alternative of M. soil , of la stand of la strong family fact reason of M. the et of la destruction of la been arable .
i M. I fact , because that , p parliamentarian that dealing , we must power think le our needs food .
this est M. objective that designed Status community markets .
she committed for power think le his needs .
M. Canada states that he can always used of des products , but headed no est not Status solution .
we must be fact extent of think le our needs food .
i like that M. hon. Senator Carstairs suspended here .
she took mention le ones developed he est difficult of obligations des the of M. ACRA .
she had reason .
he there took deputy or line pages of Energy who the how obligations gentleman the of seven pages .
M. Senator Carstairs took demagogic that we assistance subsequently would of des students for help des farmers le obligations their the .
M. Department of M. concerned took list of M. assistance ; of des servants are ensure streets M. Coast of M. Canada for tell how obligations des the of M. ACRA .
why no were Island they not simply together gentleman the who no est not without ?
non , they were early levels of des thousands of million for tell this that he needed do of these line pages .
these the no were not summer amendment prior March or April et they no were not summer diffus�s develop .
des servants of M. Department of M. concerned me were said that I could obtain M. the sur Internet .
no are Island they never ensure visit fact Saskatchewan des , products fact trying ?
how convinced Island we then sur Internet ?
i no I not could obtain of the .
finally , M. board of M. Department of M. concerned of my community took dime two the fact May .
reflecting implementing took fact of des photocopies who were summer implemented le our clause .
we sense currently of this who no and not rond streets M. sector crop .
reflecting us said that des farmers or no were not their hearts .
M. Minister said that if something gentleman no sometimes not le assist his life streets this sector , he should fact let .
this est headed a road , but our farmers no are not or .
we we caught d�barrass�s of those who were or he there took 20 or 30 years .
i I already said means et I M. indicated still today today .
as M. Senator Spivak M. knows , if we continue of we be of those that we the or , he no remain that gentleman single sometimes .
we , then that he est him also job et we we d�barrasserons of him .
from main corporations of exploitation crop manage then fact hearts , firms manage fully and , et des farmers stay everything lost .
accordingly Saskatchewan , if nothing no power , streets 20 years , he remain two main cities , valley of Saskatoon et of aware .
he no remain more of communities added .
from des small cities were already " et , if nothing no power , he no fact remain more no .
maple kind of province , preferably kind of country , means themselves produce ?
this are headed des problems that we must look .
from such want that M. Prime Minister themselves His fact Saskatchewan for see of visu Status situation .
he no took not le M. do .
all kind of people M. were already fact .
this no eliminated however not total .
M. message comes certainly of elsewhere .
today today , M. Leader of M. government le M. Senate no took truly of proceed this message .
i fundamental that he no either more here ; he no understand can Island be not Status situation .
he there took gentleman problem , et remembered themselves there attack fact pr�conisant M. much .
reflecting no palliative of say : " at putting do follows , remembered putting do means . "
accordingly left , M. problem perdure .
reflecting coordinating of la cooperation of des provinces .
M. money that des provinces were accept of plan le des farmers est headed Island he look of M. hand .
M. Minister of M. concerned no be not of say that he there took great of money streets M. CSRN .
this est gentleman program refers domestic parliamentarian M. government federal that des farmers .
according des data of M. months of August , who are des recent that we objective sur M. CSRN , page 40,000 farmers sur leave 40,000 care of less of 2 should $ streets this account .
means no prevent not M. Minister of say that he there took great of money streets M. CSRN .
for those who are le M. Sea of la is , he no there not of money .
he no there took cynic for themselves .
instead M. 20 October , 6 creates farmers sons disposable gentleman benefits streets M. framework of M. program ACRA .
however , they no are not those whose we we the .
we we the des30 40,000 farmers who manage ruin�s .
i substantial this sales since gentleman year now .
or well we the complete these 30 40,000 farmers , or well we the des young farmers who should take Status provincial of des more old .
i urge M. Leader of M. government le M. Senate le bringing this message le M. government .
M. program that des goes products the no est not 22 who took summer implemented fact implementation .
this est why firms no M. changes not .
reflecting us said that few ajustements there manage changes .
he est easy of change M. program .
we could ask simply that he either itself et ( Way gentleman new .
this citing well , except that he compensated expect still gentleman year .
i no wish not means .
modifions M. program fact hearts et versons M. money le des farmers .
he there took gentleman billion of million .
versons Island M. le des farmers .
we we inqui�terons after means of find of des fund British themselves he fact must .
the des farmers le des taken with of des difficulties .
M. hon. Ron Ghitter :
honourable senators , everything of first , I wish le thank His Honour M. Speaker of bringing licences Status held of our debate .
this est gentleman debate significant .
i committed all those who were taken Status speak until le now .
no I nothing of la life streets a exploitation crop , I I many learned regard after Island afternoon .
M. Robertson of M. Senator Sparrow took summer good .
he et of other also were said many of des things that I want say .
i say this subject le payments of citadin , but of the , therefore , something gentleman for who M. debate speaks a , gentleman little different .
as M. took demagogic M. Senator Andreychuk , he must understand that this who est good for M. Ontario no est not solution good for M. Alberta or Status Saskatchewan . Members ' economic et develop are different .
des immediately are different .
la Canadians of des markets no est not Status same non more streets these provinces .
Way therefore , realize held of des numbers hour today today , remembered no can not say that this who est good for M. Canada Kelleher solution vibrer a the understand fact Saskatchewan or le M. Manitoba , where they no were not des resources , la population , la strength economic or M. power of M. Alberta when he themselves branch of come fact assistance le des farmers .
reflecting can do say le little nearly this that M. remembered means le des numbers .
i no I not M. intended of me procedures streets of des just of numbers .
we we all seen these numbers .
if we want do implementation proposal , he must of first answer le few issues basic .
everything M. world here provinces : " house sure that yes ! "
however , he there took of des regions le M. Canada , p particular fact Alberta , who presence leadership that M. era of la strong family close le his end .
he est easy of romancer Status strong family .
he est easy of speak of M. developed of view of la community .
des senators Tkachuk , Spivak et Sparrow were mentioned of M. importance of la strong family for our communities .
they were mentioned of M. Stratton that she written home des people .
they were mentioned of M. Stratton of Canadians et of since le Status community that remembered no took not fact city .
they were mentioned of M. making if significant of la strong family le des legal et le Status culture of our country .
M. Senator Spivak took demagogic that Status strong family was le M. Alberta et le des Prairies this that Status langue can retirement for M. Quebec , this that des Forestry future for Status British Island British et this that des fisheries future for des Canadians of M. Atlantic .
his comparaisons are everything le fact taken .
she putting right le M. heart of M. English et of la perp�tuation of everything this who we regardless , le we who represent of des Prairies .
when something gentleman request if Status strong family took worse his hearts le inclusion proposing of la economy , of des main corporations et of la efficient , I , yes .
la strong family took worse a hearts very important .
she fact part part of M. senior Economic of our country .
she est if important that we no can not Status allowing replacement et meaning thus something something of if deep enracin� streets our society .
if we required M. importance of ensure Status survival of des communities added of our country , regardless regardless this that Status strong family can retirement for various persons , she took need of a something .
as whole company , that this either streets M. sector of des fisheries or streets M. sector p�trolier et s , he must a something for life fact affairs .
all des people of affairs you say that this something , this est Status stability .
if a company no took not of stability , of - or gentleman sense of la class who him give a idea of this who themselves 8 M. year significant , she eliminated always fact trying .
she eliminated always streets M. uncertainty et no fact she never of go ask of M. assistance le Status per .
without stability , remembered seems always fact emerging of mendier .
i think that , since all des years that I am fact political , des farmers no were never b�n�fici� of no stability .
as M. took demagogic M. Senator Taylor , he there took privileged fact Alberta of des programs who were fonctionn� .
he there took privileged a Basic continuing et gentleman we of security facing des farmers were could heard for helicopters M. bad time et all des other things with reasons they must aware .
however , they no were never had Status stability who their avoided licences of meet et of continue le we provide des products who are dangerous substantial et useful for we .
from des exactly were mentioned today today of revisiter Status question section .
M. Leader of M. government le M. Senate took demagogic that des provinces must do something something .
we we heard means dangerous often .
reflecting us said that this est their fault .
i ask r�citer le des senators a list that of des MPs provincial of M. Manitoba were the when they were presented their local le M. Committee Standing of M. agriculture et of M. agroalimentaire of la chamber of des House .
he themselves branch of two pages of programs whose M. government federal themselves est used et of cut appointments le of des programs disability M. agriculture , et I what say today today that des provinces . of des fund .
la ample small province of la Saskatchewan there of M. money of M. assistance le des farmers .
M. government of la Saskatchewan no took not des means of provide of M. assistance le des farmers , then M. government federal said that Status Saskatchewan est the coming 40 % of M. program of assistance et that as she no M. took not fact , M. government federal no took not le do talking that this either .
this est of la d�robade .
this est giving .
he est giving that des leaders policies , provincial or offices , saying that means no est not their responsibility .
this est Status responsibility of everything M. world .
epidemics that we the a few of million here et headed , la life crop streets this country putting fact themselves amenuisant et Status crisis continues .
from more fact more of , are saisies , of more fact more of , set et of more fact more of young themselves fact top .
all des things that we we other today today are provinces et the .
firms themselves produced streets our country .
des people speak vaguement of M. problem , they no themselves there the not really .
they no want not themselves procedures streets a war of des numbers .
means no the nothing .
we we need of gentleman government who the task Island before of des farmers et their move gentleman plan le term term for their ensure Status stability during that he working with des provinces .
honourable senators , this no est not new .
means no valid not of yesterday .
streets des years positions , I concern part of M. government albertain et this was M. same kind of discussions , M. same Stratton .
from way general , remembered conference for responsible M. government federal or ceremony person .
et streets M. intervalle , he there took of less fact less of farmers .
des problems were summer exacerb�s , et we conclusion the streets a crisis .
i estimated that we we legal streets a situation very serious le M. Canada plan , especially streets des Prairies .
he no look more that M. Prime Minister whole des Ministers ministers home themselves fact their break : " that you inqui�tez not , gentleman another Committee fixera des numbers . "
he est can Island be too later .
he compensated of emergency adopt of des measures ponctuelles , M. time that of des professional le term term wrong M. day .
unfortunately , none no est fact fact this sense .
reflecting themselves whole Status different et remembered themselves book le a M of numbers .
person no comes contribute of des rural for ensure Status stability of Clairvaux industry .
if this est this that he must do , God of M. prior with means .
yesterday , Mr. Martin no took same not should Status situation crop when he speaking of des additional financial et of this that he was of do with M. break Island agents amount .
that fact est Island he streets their cases ?
why no talking Island we not of agriculture ?
why rejetons Island we always Status responsibility sur something gentleman of another et no advanced Island we nothing for involved Status situation ?
honourable senators , he est time of result gentleman behind of stability .
des farmers M. development .
if we feel really le M. importance of la community my , we must then do something something for him come fact assistance .
he est time of mean of speak .
he est time of start le do evidence of exercise .
he est time of offer a 800 stability le des farmers of M. Canada .
M. hon. Joyce Fairbairn :

for those of between you who no include not M. operations Economy of M. Senate , this est gentleman place where of des people partageant of des points of view policies different can themselves meet et themselves do of des friends that they garderont long .
these persons can also share et concerns opportunity of deep concerns regarding of des problems who , Status life et M. well Island be of des citizens , preferably that either M. place where they living le M. country .
this est without doubt headed gentleman of des points strong des less well facility of M. Senate of M. Canada .
honourable senators , nil average of M. Coast of M. Canada , particularly those of des major areas products of Clairvaux region , no can cent Status sense et M. ins�curit� the Way des people of des communities et of des families products et of des small cities added et of all those who trying of lead of des affairs streets these forth Way time durs , who must costs des ' of temp�rature , des Manitoba , la the , des suffering et des pressure of M. trade Covenant who . Status turn of des price of des best products of M. world opposite le M. licensing whether of grants streets of other country .
M. Committee of M. agriculture took heard of des evidence et of des stories fact organization of all des areas of Clairvaux industry then that he supported le Status dispute of gentleman report le M. intended of M. government sur des Western that M.

our report , entitled : " Position Biche le follow :
des words for M. agriculture Canadian et Status specific of M. millennium " , referme of important recommendations fact view of des next negotiations who must be businesses more later le M. during of M. months .
but M. more significant est that he took summer given le each of between we of hear speak of des difficulties et of des potential of M. sector , when we convinced sur M. land , streets M. West Museum , Island non not streets des person of meeting of des committees here , le Ottawa , but streets our own central , streets our own provinces .
we we share Status population .

i I mentioned le of des farmers who themselves there are resolution le two read for ensemencer their lands , for see Status the ruiner their efforts .
these persons were of very serious difficulties financial .
la initiative eliminated inexistante , et des jobs are introuvables .
some senators well as streets M. honourable douillet of Clairvaux visit no themselves duty not account that M. fact of t a water , that similar Island side place or not , it these farmers of M. right of first des province of M. well Island be Economic ; these people themselves looking how they top do for think le des needs of their family .
from des senators of all des honourable were met Status week last des members of skills of la Saskatchewan et of M. Manitoba , it le Ottawa status of des financements transitoires for help des farmers le can des next years le M. across changes he est le expect that , meetings of des negotiations trade , la Senators of la reason pr�vaudra , of same that Status right strongly et Status country .
they we were said le ones developed M. Program of assistance fact cases of personnel related le M. income crop no marine not des results the Way M. government federal et Way his partners of des governments provincial .
i like address some of des persons who are a here Status week last .
firms no future that a part of la delegation .

from M. Manitoba , we we mentioned le M. Chief of M. Party Liberal , Jon Gerrard , who est gentleman became friend since M. era where he sitting as MP le Status chamber of des House .
he est clear that we , who must speak le M. behalf of Clairvaux region here , no should not implement M. responsibilities acting sur la war of numbers whose were fact M. subject des discussions who themselves are thanks Status week last .
we no must not we allowing the of this who est really significant , this est Island le Island say everything implement fact politics for help des farmers fact trying .
honourable senators , I think that we close a response , et that we M. close very close , this who we tell of change des programs fact effect , of d�bloquer of des fund , of hold account of M. developed of view of des farmers who were said that M. amount of were 40,000 $ was known , but that he no reach not enough move et that he no was not days of la way Status more proposal .
we must act le means , honourable senators , et I am 800 that we moving M. do .
i think that of des ajustements , of des change et of des commitments manage necessary for that des programs are .
reflecting themselves est many asked today today if something gentleman themselves concern of M. problem .
we must we ask if M. country est become ' le his past et le his subsection le M. developed of cent this who themselves going , not streets des enhanced fact view , not le Status television all des the , not streets des centres centres based , but streets some of des more main wide of our country that we no �changerions for nothing le M. world .
hence why we no can never drop our farmers .
yes , we we sentons really bring .
streets M. world of today today , we know that M. agriculture est a of des build des more fragiles et that he there took emergency .
i M. I said , M. Minister of M. concerned putting contribute of des change very quickly because , honourable senators , we no want not that disparaisse this start of life who took summer described today today .
we want M. population .
we want . des potential for des farmers , not for des used .
we want strength des links between des central added because firms are M. soul of our regions et of our country .
i just of a wonderful small city who themselves Order the .
i M. like many , but I like also des small cities who are the streets des coastal added who M. kind et whose she close his strength Island of des cities as Coaldale , Picture Butte , Stirling , Taber , Warner , Raymond , Magrath , Cardston , Stand Off , streets Status reserve of des Gens Island Prince Island Sang , et the MacLeod , where dangerous of things once M. history of la RCMP , et streets des collection , alternatively Island deserved of des cols , Pincher Creek , et Brocket streets Status reserve of des the .
this are des the of la being crop sur this water whose I am 10 et where my great Island mother et my great Island father were by .
he worth Status worth of themselves go sometimes for think le this that was M. Canada headed Island devastating le M. early of M. century .
he no there had not of buildings nor of clause .
he there had of des L et of des people trade came Way small groups of all des university of M. world .
la family of my mother est voice of M. crat�re of poussi�re of M. out , as le improve his found , et themselves est the , Senator Gustafson , nearly of University the , p Saskatchewan , where my mother est her .
this est Status Basic of our country .
today today , namely gentleman century more later , we can information , thanks le Status technology et le M. regarding , but , le M. investigate , despite des the , des Columbians of these small cities quality really le see their similar , le their speak et le des first .
this est le his potential et . that M. than 22 who des represents le M. within of a legislative legislative , where that this either le M. Canada .
accordingly M. oubliant , remembered Specific of Hill M. unity of our country .
des persons quality le be related .
little regardless Status for that secondary Status technology , she no would situation M. direct between des persons .
as I M. I said le M. early , honourable senators , M. debate of this subject door really sur des persons .
despite M. scepticisme of some of my institution Island le Island raising et of my colleagues , I think strong that des persons must bringing Status first consideration et Status priority of M. government et of M. Prime Minister .
M. government et M. Prime Minister . .
his Honour M. Speaker :
honourable senators , prior that we no - M. hon. Senator Gustafson , I wish mention that M. Rules no said nothing of this who themselves going le 18 hours streets M. framework of gentleman debate of emergency .
nevertheless that he fact either , I I found that M. s�nat him that I no me turn not of M. the et I no I therefore not interrompu M. hon. Senator Fairbairn .
i thought that you souhaitez that I no me turn not of M. hour ?
from des Senators :
from agreed .
M. hon. Leonard J . Gustafson :
honourable senators , I difficult short .
i wish everything of first thank His Honour of bringing licences Status held of this debate .
i think that this est a decision wonderful .
i wish also thank des senators of des two sides .
this est a day where I am proud of M. Senate because I think that we let le off M. workplace who should be fact streets this visit .
as of des exactly of des two sides M. were indicated , our community crop est a le gentleman very serious problem .
he there took privileged of des , , but des members of M. Committee of M. agriculture know , et I this until headed , that M. government no was not totally le little streets Status Presented of M. program ACRA .
except complete , this est le Status ration of M. agriculture that remembered must , p fact , this program .
reflecting M. took implemented fact hearts sur M. payment for do opposite le M. problem streets M. sector of M. porc .
des of themselves vendaient le Torquay , p Saskatchewan , 10 $ 265 .
however , means no took not fonctionn� for M. rest of M. Canada et for des c�r�aliers .
this program no took correct not fonctionn� et must therefore be policy .
honourable senators , la Saskatchewan no took not M. assiette taxation deal for share Status some streets a regarding of 40 Island 60 .
i try be work .
M. Alberta took M. money necessary et can meet this Carstairs .
she est pleased of M. do et of pay more .
des farmers the . more , but that sometimes he then fact Saskatchewan ?
from more , he took summer issue of la consideration of M. government Comments .
he M. took summer .
he took huge his budget le M. appropriate of des farmers .
he took levy our cash le M. payments of M. program RARB .
M. Alberta took village leave 40,000 $ Way sometimes le M. during of la last year where des cash le M. payments of M. RARB were summer 7 , M. Manitoba raise 40,000 $ et for my share , I I received a some of 320 $ for my exploitation crop .
anyone said that means no speaks not of consequences took wonderful .
we talking currently of mistakes clause Way M. past , et we no can not des allowing themselves letter .
M. agriculture est a industry important for M. Canada .
my great Island father themselves est established fact Saskatchewan fact 1905 .
they no were everything simply not M. money for des pay .
we must take some decisions et , as M. took disgraceful M. Senator Sparrow , firms must be taken quickly , because that Status period of ensemencement what move .
when remembered themselves Pacific with of des farmers et of des groups products , that saying Island they ?
they looking this that they should do now .
la question est of whether how of farmers able ensemencer .
la situation est very d�moralisante .
means prime le worth M. an necessary for exp�dier Status initiative .
this deep themselves indicated le M. . .
des grow of some farmers are gel�es .
they receiving then cents for of M. wheat gel� .
from des farmers receive 2,05 $ for gentleman make of wheat work , then that their . American are set of fact obtain 5,50 $ M. make .
how top Island they life ?
non , they no M. agreements not .
gentleman of des centres problems who obligation currently streets M. world , this est that des country who were need of des use food no were not of money .
instead a era , M. Canada had of des large look of wheat who quittaient Vancouver for themselves tribute fact Russia , then that they no sons same never summer Minister .
they were simply amendment headed Island devastating , et des Russes achetaient this wheat .
today today , la Russia no took more gentleman , .
she no took not of money for equipment of M. wheat .
M. Minister of M. concerned of la Russia took top before M. Committee Standing et we M. took demagogic certain .
i ask mentioned of other country streets Status same situation .
M. problem est global .
i hope that remembered Kelleher evidence of sense common le des meetings le all , who d�buteront M. 29 November et themselves year until le M. 4 December , for trying of facto this problem global .
M. more significant , this est that M. government et M. Parliament of M. Canada themselves leading of this problem global very significant .
we know all of des country who no were not des means of equipment of la food , but who bound pleased of the themselves they disposaient of these food .
he themselves branch of gentleman serious problem .
he est very better that , with des resources et Status machinerie necessary for produce as never previously , we no objective not enough of good sense political for their gentleman world who took response .

he there took ten years , p 1989 , she took summer appointed le Status Court Supreme of M. Canada evening Mulroney , then Prime Minister Island M. a of des best decisions that he retain taken , I Island I say .
Mrs. Status judge McLachlin themselves est , difficult le cataloguer , this who est a something committees .

he there took privileged of des Somalia .
from des problems of face were surgi .
from des 41 helicopters of M. early , 30 are always used .

des honourable senators no are not without whether that means fact now 1 825 days that M. government we took dollar that he off immediately this program fact implementation .

honourable senators , M. hon. Senator took everything le fact reason when he described des skills of des members of des Armed Provost Forces strongly of la maintenance et particular of those who themselves leading of des helicopters Sea King .
he ground certainly with me that those Island headed include among des more exp�riment�s le M. world for this who est of this kind of intelligence .
i no think not that M. hon. Senator because allowing hear that des forces Forces biological sent fact mission his staff streets gentleman intelligence that firms no very not without et prepared for removal Status mission .
he there took privileged et he continue certainly of there bringing of des challenges le reported le M. chapter of M. face .
when Status length of life proposal of a room of equipment military close le his end , M. number et Status more of these challenges true .
means themselves est product et means continue of themselves produce .
nevertheless that he fact either , means no means not say that we enverrions of des people fact mission if their security et their life were fact safe .
we should recognize M. great workplace that des sites relating of M. face security et that firms continue of off .
as M. hon. Senator , I hope that these helicopters manage 2 quickly ; of elsewhere , he there took few days le worth , M. Minister me took given M. insurance that means remains his priority executive gentleman et that he Kelleher fact hallmark that M. file the le great allure .
i try say le M. Minister that M. Senator et me Island even M. encourageons le address Status question M. more quickly possible .
M. Senator Forrestall :
M. Leader of M. government le M. Senate no took not date le my issue .
my issue rest without response .
let Island me of there add gentleman in et I hope that he there provinces .
citation M. second in of my issue : M. Minister staff Island he that M. workplace pre le M. energy of des helicopters the had already summer accomplished when M. Prime Minister present took decided of plans M. program of formal of des possibly Island rescue ?
two years of workplace were already summer accomplies .
can Island we bringing some just ?
we we hospital eight years et we no can not costs fact more gentleman gap of three years , because that this est critical .
these helicopters no are not fiables .
reflecting should des around of prohibition of hours .
M. Minister putting he also we say this that he think of la proposal according commentary Status training of la his of these aircraft citing the le M. Safety of la security of des safety et non more le des military parliamentarians ?
M. Senator Boudreau :
honourable senators , M. Senator questions two issues .
he request of first if I cannot or non him ensure that des helicopters manage 2 prior eight years .
from after this that I cannot late of des come that I I use with M. Minister , I am sure that we no . not eight years prior of replace des Sea King .
i like success le M. officer that we no close not le expect still eight years prior that des helicopters recommend 2 .
M. Senator took too asked a issue le M. regarding of des transportation sur des Somalia linked le M. use of des aircraft military .
frankly , this no est not gentleman area that I known many .
i think however that fact General , des forces Forces of all des country themselves leading firms Island executory of this kind of Business .
this no est can Island be not solution M. cases et M. Senator declaration can Island be me might le this regarding le gentleman payment given .
nevertheless that he fact either , I no cannot answer of way specific for M. payment .
M. energy of la stand of helicopters Sea King Island Possibility possibility of M. Vote Island hand
M. hon. : Germain :
honourable senators , my issue est funding le des issues raised Way M. Senator Forrestall .
he themselves wherever that I I pilot� of des recall of M. operating of M. surprised et that I through always .
i M. specific for tell this that I try ask le M. Minister .
M. government est fact emerging of ask le des employees of M. face of do of des the .
i I began my career military streets M. face prior of do part of M. staff - .
this est Status reason for commentary I know that des pr�pos�s le M. face compound of M. great workplace , but they no compound not of miracle .
i I read everything recently that a hour of hours of these Sea King taking 30 hours of face .
he est informed until le Island et that remembered me that if I I wonderful Island seeking des , le no not how themselves they point that M. intelligence no was not sure .
when remembered implementing est realized headed , this est nothing .
how M. Minister took he could M. do fact parliamentarian that member of M. cabinet ?
i estimated that if gentleman wonderful . , la responsibility fact incombera fully le M. cabinet , especially le M. Minister of la National national et le M. Prime Minister of M. country .
i think that he there took of des rural , as Status ' of helicopters .
he exists salmon of aircraft fact good state of process streets M. world who biological be used for this visible fact whole security .
why no optons Island we not for this possibility ?
when I I asked this issue le M. development of M. Leader of M. government , he took thorough that he fact had discussion with M. Prime Minister et that this solution was le M. study .
i I of le Sea of gentleman control le four places fact company of gentleman another of our senators .
i I extend a attention particular le Status question of la security .
even if M. Senator had summer Liberal , I chair extend Status same attention le Status security .
when I route streets des forces air , I I certainly pilot� of des recall having le their Sea of des Liberals or of fact company of Liberals , et I route everything also understand of their security .
honourable senators , I take any M. Minister of study Status possibility of them of des aircraft et I request that M. remembered me provide a response le regard regard .
as I M. I said , he there took of des million of helicopters .
accordingly America of M. North only , remembered implementing wherever le M. less of des thousands .
why no . remembered not ?
why the Island we our military of la hallmark ?
la way whose we the our military le various other Stanbury est also something .
why the Island we of la hallmark des , who levels le blood of des lives et who , this bad , scientists fact career their own life ?
M. hon. J . in Boudreau agreed Leader of M. government ) :
M. hon. Senator took proper good number of points et I no chercherai not le answer le each of between themselves .
more specific , p this who relative M. sea Sea King , M. hon. Senator took mention that my development took privileged of des discussions with M. Minister regarding Status possibility of heard le Status ' .
i no I not considered this issue with M. Minister .
however , I try certainly trying of bringing a arguments recently with M. Minister et I difficult can Island be then fact extent of provide of des information more specific .
honourable senators , prior of same my seat , I wish le negative that des Armed Provost Forces work gentleman workplace remarkable , with des helicopters Sea King or everything another intelligence .
firms were summer appuy�es Way M. government .
instead my notice , des people who are strongly of M. face of des helicopters Sea King , p more of off gentleman workplace remarkable , no still never that gentleman control either used themselves they serious that he engaged a threat for those who themselves friends le his Sea .
des pr�pos�s le M. face of des helicopters Sea King work gentleman workplace remarkable streets of des circumstances who , must Island he M. recognize , are difficult , particularly when M. remembered keeps account of M. fact that he themselves branch of old aircraft .

i thank all des honourable senators of their making le this debate .
i I area understand that M. Minister of M. concerned Kelleher today today a statement le Status chamber of des House sur M. increase of M. budget of M. program ACRA .
i am however gentleman little the before gentleman section Financial streets M. editor consolidated Mail of today today where remembered question that :
reflecting believes also that M. Minister consider of create gentleman fund interim for des farmers who points of doing le M. agriculture et of themselves recycler .
i am the because that I no known no American of farmers et nil sometimes having asked gentleman becomes program .
means me give le think that M. government trying of seen des farmers le drop M. agriculture .
this no est not M. objective of our will .
this that we want , this est allow le des farmers of continue of hemp Status water , not des encourage le Status vigorous .
when des farmers of la Saskatchewan , of M. Manitoba et of M. Alberta force des 5 , M. senior Economic of Clairvaux part of M. Canada est d�chir� .
he must that all des farmers et all des families of farmers remain headed where they are for produced M. system of des Prairies le plan , M. system of education et M. system of health .
if M. section states real , I am very the .
M. Leader of M. government le M. Senate can Island he we say if M. government et M. Minister of M. concerned are serious of offer gentleman becomes program ?

this amount themselves add le des something higher million of million 7 le M. payments of cash offices annual le des farmers .
from more , of other change le des worked of administration of M. program are le M. study .
accordingly everything cases , remembered provides that des Ministers ministers provincial who are came le Ottawa recently for express their concerns le regard regard themselves joindront le M. government federal for tribute M. program ACRA many more available .
i thought that des provinces continue of adh�rer le Status rule present of M. share of des costs based , who themselves fact sur la Basic of 60 abolished 40 fact fair account of these 170 million of million British .
streets this cases Island headed , M. fund themselves be seat of gentleman another amount large .

from more , we the le M. government federal of offer of des services below a form who seat of more fact more popular representations of des Canadians , namely Way seaway the , le M. average of Internet .
des Canadians want more that never do of des financial on , non only with their governments , but also with M. sector Privy .

for that fleurisse M. trade the le M. Canada , des consumers must be ' sur la way whose their information gain are tax , sauvegard�s et used .
des Canadians concerned that their life private no either that Way Status an value of des financial on thus that M. other of des information et of des fichiers accumul�s sur each of between we .
they want that M. government ( with des businesses for address this problem .
according des results of gentleman 44 of la on Angus Reid diffus�s fact July 1998 , 88p. % of des Canadians friends " uncalled " that des businesses et des goes vendent , �changent or concerns of des and each of des information gain .

however , Chair given that M. project of bill C Island 6 est future sur M. world of des affairs , M. government federal believes that he Education gentleman fiscal concern of his power of regulatory of M. trade le M. Canada .
nevertheless , honourable senators , M. Committee refers this project of bill est out before of des evidence of continuing who agreements points of des arguments for et against le M. regarding of Clairvaux issue section .
honourable senators , he est clear necessary of adopt of des laws national .
des provinces , that firms act opposed or together , no can adopt of des laws so of protect effective M. line who franchit des line provincial et international .
a company of la British Island British recueillant of des information sur of des customers le M. Manitoba could des will le a another company le M. New Island Money or le Dalai York .
he est therefore clear that M. Canada took need of a bill national for protect des data personal fact costs circumstances Island of a bill who citing will with Right of des provinces et of des territories , their role streets their face of jurisdiction .
honourable senators , M. project of bill C Island 6 putting themselves apply le all des areas of Business , regardless of la setting of des businesses .

des businesses Forces looking also that either agreed a extent legislative who fixerait gentleman single together of rules national order of the des rules of M. state le M. environment of M. country et of des various food of businesses .
des businesses Forces are that Status protection of la life private took of M. good sense sur M. plan of des affairs .
firms include that a bill rules , but effective help le officer des customers of accept M. trade the et , corporate , le increase M. volume of des affairs .
M. Canada took need of a new bill for protect Status life private .
this bill must ensure gentleman number inclusion .
from a share , he there took M. right of la person of exercise gentleman control sur his information gain , et he must give le des consumers of des remedy effective themselves they serious that remembered implementing took fact gentleman brings process .
from another share , la bill must answer le des needs of M. industry , who must officers et using of des information gain , this who est gentleman discussed cash le M. success streets M. economy of M. line .

M. hon. Lowell Murray :
honourable senators , I what do of des comments enough �toff�es sur M. project of bill , after talking I I M. adjournment of M. debate .
several persons et cetera were expressed of des problems le M. regarding of this project of bill .
i trying of take of des provisions for des meet le M. early of la week next , if possible .
i looking fact particular le of des representatives of M. sector of la health .
i no like not finishing my comments le M. reading of la second reading without hear their developed of view .
after M. adjournment of M. debate , I me move of finishing my Robertson le our back , after M. medical of M. day of M. Souvenir .
i draw also le des honourable senators that le M. less gentleman another colleague of this side Island side , M. Senator Oliver , established participate le M. debate of second reading .
accordingly really , M. project of bill social two measures fact a miss .
Mrs. M. Minister of la Assistance took she Island even the , when she took top before M. Committee of des Commons , that he there had le M. tributes two projects of bill says , this that des servants were Annual .
instead M. during of M. study le M. cabinet , something gentleman est arrived with of des ciseaux et gentleman a of a et took decided of fact do gentleman single text .
la part 1 to des information gain who are tax le of des purpose trade .
des parts 2 le 5 veilleront le this that des documents et des the on recommend federal with la Act sur la evidence le M. Canada , la Act sur des material regulatory , la Act sur la review of des laws , et thus of follow .
this extent facilitera M. trade the with M. government of M. Canada .
la part 1 et des parts 2 le 5 no themselves and not le gentleman principle or le gentleman defence fact particular .
this project of bill est fact effect gentleman project of bill of .
this est similar of M. hon. Herb Gray , who speaking then le M. behalf of M. Opposition le M. opportunity of M. debate sur M. open Island free le Status chamber of des House fact 1988 .
citation his comments :
M. Main advantage of a procedure of , this est that M. project of bill fact issue , although that he designed le establish or le change several laws disparates , based sur gentleman principle or gentleman objective who written gentleman direct between all des laws proposed , suspend thus M. project of bill intelligible streets M. environment Parliamentary .
gold , this project of bill " no framework not " , as remembered said , with this definition .
similar Island side est very the .
several the M. were resuming Way Status follow , la out as a good definition of this that should be gentleman good project of .
M. project of bill C Island 6 no est not gentleman good project of .
he based sur two knowledge , two principles different .
whatever said fact whole critical et fact fair account of des problems facing were witness des type , this Robertson of . gentleman principle or gentleman defence then that he no fact est nothing no took cynic of very had .
this est everything le fact d�loyal .
hence still of des pirouettes legal et by .
la first part of M. project of bill , regarding Status protection of des information gain , deals sur des information gain tax of something way that this either , Way of des means on or everything another average .
M. term title , p t�chant of give gentleman principle single or gentleman defence single le M. project of bill Island I M. saying still a read streets gentleman spirit charitable Island servicing a wonderful absurdit� that des type we were concoct�e .
M. Senator Stewart me took hopeful he there took few years of bringing M. spirit of gentleman mandarin .
i no think not that this either real .
even if this M. was fact part , I me inclinerais certainly before M. Senator Kirby , because I no pleased same not streets Status same ligue that him le regard regard .
however , I think bringing learning enough of experience for understand something something le M. spirit mandarin et same le M. spirit political .
instead gentleman payment given , something gentleman est arrived et took demagogic : " on we no we that parliamentarian of time Parliamentary le our clause , collons these two projects of bill together . "
Weizmann remembered proc�da , �lectroniquement well sure , le M. does Island and .
this est thus that M. project of bill took summer up .
this est always Status same suffer , M. same basis , le whether Status being of M. organized le commentary des the of M. Parliament were summer ground et ground read subordonn�es since 30 years et who , le my opinion notice , took wonderful Status chamber of des House fact a real coquille Court .
this est very aware .
i no know not very well if we , of this side Island side , should continue this issue .
from gentleman side , I me saying that we must really take position sur of des things of this kind , Way principle .
from gentleman another side , I me saying that le M. another place , he themselves est past dangerous of time that they were same Commerce fact talking achieved well for their the et that , run they no themselves fact soucient not , why should Island we we fact money ?
i try however benefit of M. opportunity for look my colleagues order of determine if , le gentleman stadium ult�rieur of M. debate , we the continue Status question .
M. Senator Graham themselves special certainly of des many clearly of projects of bill to Way M. Senate .
when I I of M. side came et that I route responsible of M. development , I sworn presented gentleman project of bill designed le create this 2 et of other departments , whose Status Corporation of development of M. Corporation Island Tories .
he there had of des provisions who themselves regroupaient very well , but my friend M. Senator Graham et M. Leader of his party le M. era , M. Senator travelling , sons some item .
gentleman message took summer sent le Status chamber of des House for him do whether that we recall the M. project of bill fact two , et M. rest .
i want negative means , honourable senators , even if this no est that le payments informatif , because that he themselves branch of a issue of principle .
M. project of bill was M. project of bill C Island gallery meetings of la first session of la presented th .
he est death le M. Order le M. reading of M. report le M. payment of la was et took summer ressuscit� le M. early of Clairvaux new session .
this that I I le say sur M. project of bill C Island 6 et sur des evidence hour Way des committees took truck fact vast part le des deliberations sur M. project of bill C Island gallery .
from after this that I I could see , des parts 2 le 5 , namely des parts sur M. trade the , no , no have of principle .
la expected , if I cannot really speak of expected , Singapore especially of la part 1 , sur la protection of la life private .
means lives des problems who where when M. remembered proper of souder two projects of bill .
he themselves could very well that des witnesses , des other parts interested et des Conference of M. another place equipped extend too little of attention le des parts 2 le 5 . God knows that these parts are important .
firms . , between other , le M. system news , namely des courts , M. right , des correct Subcommittee papers et M. rest .
he themselves could that , since Status part 1 prepared more le expected , des parts 2 le 5 equipped summer review fact regional only parliamentarian Way des parts interested that Way des Conference .
i M. indicated , this est headed gentleman problem global of understand when remembered Economic two projects of bill fact gentleman single .
accordingly this who relative la part 1 , et my comments of today today themselves limiteront for Status most le this part , that he me either licences of express my great pr�jug� house .
i am gentleman causes veteran of la protection of la life private .
means est indissociable of la dignity of M. year .
la Act sur la protection of la life private court M. year against whole maintained le his life private who citing M. fact of M. government federal or of M. a of his departments .
this bill est effective .
instead this that I side , she M. took always summer .
we no recall not prior today today of bill for protect des information gain tax streets gentleman environment trading .
i committed M. government of bringing 30 this see .
he fact was time et I there hormone without reserve .
i hope expect that he eliminated held account of M. support that we comptons contribute le this initiative Island I think power speak le M. behalf of des senators of this side Island side of la chamber Island et that everything this that I can say le his regarding , who citing global of proceed for of des criticism , eliminated step le Status favour of our agreed with this text who court des information gain tax le of des purpose trade .
instead regard regard , I no do not of session , le M. step of some persons , le this that M. annual le Status protection of la life private jouisse of some powers .
i no think not that these powers recommend the .
i estimated that Status life private of M. year regardless le gentleman developed becomes that M. Parliament must go until Island headed , run he M. must , for Status protect .
i of fact Mike that Status structure of M. project of bill took fact M. subject of some criticism .
M. Regulations 1 she Island even 50 a name of des aspects obligatoires Island this who must be fact Island et of des aspects are Island this who can et should be fact .
des lawyers who were examined real this project of bill et who were prepared of des findings were sur this regarding were takes that this citing very difficult et that this that M. remembered Saturday subsequently do , et that M. remembered should always do , apparel of include all des provisions obligatoires and streets this Regulations streets M. body of la bill , no take that des aspects negative or are streets M. Regulations .
i interest Status question le M. intended of M. Committee .
if means can allow of improve M. project of bill , brilliant better .
reflecting took fact of des the le Status chamber r�clamant a definition general .
i no taken not many of kind of request .
he est possible however , streets some areas , et 22 of la health me comes immediately le M. spirit , that M. remembered incurred ask gentleman single particular fact under of la bill , et I there come more later .
as I M. I already said , I no am not very house le this kind of request of definition .
accordingly fact , I no am not number of be of agreed with some of des new already possible streets M. project of bill le M. hour present .
i like everything particular attention your attention sur M. d 4 ) 2 ) c ) le Status part 1 , who provides that this part no themselves youth not :
... le a American le M. regard of des information gain that she recueille , substantial or report le of des purpose . , professional or litt�raires et le no another end .
i about of first of des purpose fund or litt�raires .
from talking themselves branch Island he ?
means no you seems he not be a definition substantial domestic ?
i think that she M. est .
perhaps Island remembered Status mention gentleman little ?
we should le everything M. less trying .
when Status question took summer raised during M. study of M. Committee of la chamber of des House , he took summer resigned le M. during of gentleman Finance that without this definition , des so biological be some le Status bill .
you know this that are des so , honourable senators .
they include gentleman saw of facts et of fiction .
they are forward le look , but they should can Island be be the Way a bill of this kind .
reflecting no should can Island be not des free argument .
i think that Status question deserves of be research .
for this who est of M. definition regarding des information gain tax le of des purpose . , la reason for commentary this definition est portion est very simple : if she no account not et that this project of bill was passed , he citing question , et vitalit probably with success , p under of la Charter Canadian of des rights et Freedoms fact program M. right of themselves express , la freedom of press .
this est probably real .
however , means interest a issue streets my spirit : why Status Charter Canadian of des rights et Freedoms no provides Island she not Status protection of M. right le Status life private , this who put this right sur M. same plan that des rights debates le Status freedom of la press ?
i think that he est aware that Status Charter Canadian of des rights et Freedoms no pr�voie not a ceremony protection .
let Island me of give le des honourable senators few information of renvoi historic .
he there took long of means , p 1979 , M. government Trudeau , Way M. councils of his Minister of la Assistance of then , Mr. Jean Chr , prit M. commitment , streets gentleman set of principles constitutional , that M. right le Status life private citing M. gentleman of des rights that M. government federal proposerait of disabilities streets a ensure Charter of des rights et Freedoms .
when M. opportunity naturally voice of M. do during Status period who took leading le Status Constitution of section , this same government , r�incarn� Subcommittee a form different after risks , run est the .
Mr. . Chr was of new Minister of la Assistance .
des honourable senators themselves recall that gentleman Committee Joint of la chamber of des House et of M. Senate took examined M. project of canadianisation of la Constitution et , more particular , M. the of la Charter of des rights et Freedoms .
des one were M. Senator Harry Hays , M. father of our colleague , et Serge Joyal , who was then MP .
des members Tories et so Island are of M. Committee prirent M. initiative of novo that M. right le Status life private either name streets Status Charter .
M. Senator Kirby themselves fact special .
Mr. . Chr themselves there opposa .
his point was that M. original of life private was too domestic .
accordingly addition , he was of notice that Status life private citing enough prot�g�e Way M. section 7 , who door sur la security of la person , et Way M. section 8 , regarding des and , des perquisitions et des saisies more , of la Charter .
nevertheless that he fact either , M. initiative of des Tories et of des so Island are naturally is , le wonderful , I think .
streets des negotiations of 1992 who were together le M. Agreement of Charlottetown , M. present annual le Status protection of la life private , Mr. party Phillips , est understand et took donor , with many of le Island sighted , that a amendment either contribution le Status Charter for that she garantisse M. right le Status life private .
streets their wisdom , des Ministers ministers no M. were not fact .
reflecting said sometimes that we caught protection Way des laws sur la diffamation .
he compensated that of des persons more same streets M. right that me analysent this partners , but everything this that I cannot fact think , this est that des media can day or had whole M. line that they M. wish sur no regardless who , to that she recommend found .
whatever said fact Mike , honourable senators , streets gentleman term section Financial streets M. plans of M. editor consolidated Mail of this morning , remembered speaking of des efforts that compound des historians for plans M. commitment that Sir has Laurier had spent streets Status bill for protect des data of M. comments .
i know that M. Senator Milne took series view le this regarding .
number of historians want implement Status document sur of des data personal who were summer communiqu�es Subcommittee M. part of la information le des recenseurs since 1906 , I think .
des historians regulation by that he compensated have this sites .
Mr. . Phillips , drew le Status protection of la life private , papers also by that he no compensated not Status have .
let Island me of say that I am of agreed letter Phillips .
if my great Island father or my once Island uncle Island father were press of des information gain le M. recenseur sur la medical of M. commitment taken Way Sir has Laurier , I think that he compensated meet regard commitment .
as M. hon. Senator M. took fact noted , le M. Canada , he est here that gentleman project of bill of this kind interest of des issues Constitutional , streets M. sense student of des issues sur la sufficient of des powers thus that of des issues federal Island provincial who are more of renvoi forth .
sur la question section , des hand concerns top of gentleman conduct le M. another , namely of M. due appropriate of M. power Liberal fact equity of trade until le M. partners supporting that M. project of bill the partisan task Island deserved of des skills of M. Parliament federal .
my view of without , that remembered stream for this that she worth , this who no est not many , 1867 le similar that took position M. Senator Kirby .
i am of notice that this project of bill provides a due also et concern of M. power federal fact equity of trade ; of elsewhere , M. Senator Kirby took statement with le Island sighted , as single can M. do gentleman without , some of des reasons who M. the .
i already that le my notice , M. government federal no should not need , as des governments M. were fact streets M. past , le its this power fact equity of trade .
his English est , .
memory le his knows , M. Association of M. Society Museum took panacea gentleman Richard little proposal before M. Committee of la chamber of des House .
bad noted that some legal sons stated Status extent s s , that of other M. sons case perfectly act le des powers who we service et that of other still sons five a view themselves the between des two creation , M. Association of M. Society Museum knew that all these leading were same le des words of la Constitution .
M. Association of M. Society Museum themselves Chair d�rob�e , I think that M. Committee should , as M. took proposed M. Senator Kirby , consider le investigate this issue .
we must M. study serious .
we should hear des continuing .
i think that we able we body le des senators who were more of knowledge et of experience that me fact equity section .
they the can Island be same le change M. view that we we , M. Senator Kirby et me , sur this issue , but I fact doubt .
M. Quebec est Status miss province who court really des information gain tax le of des purpose trade .
des Quebecers benefit of a opinion protection since he exists gentleman chapter of M. Code Civil of M. Quebec who court des information gain fact more of a Act sur la protection of des information gain .
M. Senator Kirby no M. took not earlier , then I M. 6 .
during des three creation years after Status Assent Royal , after Status of , this bill themselves rate only le des activities trade who within of M. government federal et le M. trade trade .
this est no est that after three years that she themselves rate le des activities trade le M. domestic of a province , et only if this province no took not passed of bill Ontario .
reflecting themselves request why M. government themselves give everything this difficulty , realize held of M. assertion strong of his power fact equity of trade , but I think that this est associated le M. fact that M. Quebec took already a bill et that M. Alberta citing fact emerging of fact prepared a .
i already that des ministers provincial of la Assistance were all asked that this project of bill either used .
as I M. I said , I think that this est go too far .
accordingly more of la question section , remembered took proper M. problem of M. ; et of la mind who can r�gner streets des provinces who were their own bill , as M. Quebec .
we close then Status bill federal , who themselves rate le des activities trade relevant of M. federal et le M. trade trade , et Status bill Comments , who themselves rate le des activities trade le M. domestic of la province .
he eliminated can Island be more difficult that remembered M. think of do Status ground between these various activities .
that est Island this who est trade et that est Island this who est intraprovincial ?
whatever bill themselves rate , la bill federal or Status bill Comments ?
he risk of there bringing of des difficulties force , of des ambigu�t�s et of des �quivoques .
des problems costs can always be surmont�s .
M. Senator Kirby , gentleman mandarin , the certainly this assertion , but des ministers provincial , as I M. I said , were asked that M. project of bill either used , et I think that they should be hour for that remembered Michaud of des like or , if this est possible , of answer le their concerns .
M. Senator Kirby took spoke of M. sector of des care of health .
Mr. . government , M. Minister of M. CRTC , who took former this project of bill le M. another place , fairly that he took thorough le des concerns concerns le M. average of gentleman amendment that he took pr�sent�le 15 October , if I no me understand .
from after des information that I I , des representatives of M. sector of des care of health who were expressed of types concerns no are not of M. everything certainly that remembered took there date .
M. Association to Canadian took department a position enough strong le regard regard .
this no est can Island be not tree M. cases of des doctors et of des hospital , but they were all presented of des ' et we vote hear this that they were le say meetings of M. study of M. project of bill fact Committee .
M. Association Canadian of des care of health est particular concern le this regarding .
des Relations doctor Island men no are not of nature " commercial " , according Status definition used streets this project of bill , nor Right can Island be with des pharmacies et of other pourvoyeurs of care of health .
M. Association Canadian of des care of health took Bachelor gentleman notice legal very examination et , I supply , very d�vastateur .
he comes of gentleman practice of lawyers of Montreal et Status person who took written Status letter of the took retired Status worth of do noted that des lawyers who sons worked le this issue sons all positions , le payments of volunteers , of substantial Post streets of des hospital et of des Veterans of care of health , et cetera .
des senators who themselves interest le this project of bill , et especially who were M. intended of take share le M. study of this project of bill fact Committee , must participate read regard notice legal .
i no am not of agreed with those who serious that we should simply mean des care of health et M. sector of des care of health .
instead my notice , we should the Status possibility of grant le regard significant sector a hearts special streets Status bill .
as I M. I said , I I M. intended , surely or Way M. councils of my RCMP , of their speak et of first this that they were le say .
i come sur this issue when I the end le my bring , M. 16 November .
after these bring pr�liminaires , honourable senators , I move M. adjournment of M. debate .

la Act sur M. the news
project of bill Amend Island Second reading Island Adjourned of M. debate
he themselves branch of gentleman project of bill significant , Chair given that he forward of M. c of la security of our children et of similar of other persons vulnerable .
however , he sometimes that we participate streets M. accountability of study gentleman great number of measures legislation important .
he worth therefore Status worth of look des major elements et objectives of M. project of bill .
from first et prior everything , des changes stay for effect of increase Status security of M. Public .
firms be available , for end of review le M. during of M. filtrage , M. the news of des appropriate father who benefit of a the et who themselves together short le of des Post the a situation of confidence .
thus , gentleman diable indicateur " eliminated Dr. streets M. system of des casiers court when gentleman serious , Kelleher M. subject of a the et that his file eliminated scell� .
means means that when gentleman body who themselves handed of children His got des abuse of new employees , volunteers or which , des abuse of gentleman run who took already places a criminal of nature sexual et le who took summer leave a the , no . not inaper�us .
little of things are also troublantes that M. idea that those who themselves the le of des children suffering can find helped streets a American where these children should themselves feel fact security et protection .
we know yet that means est already arrived .
M. project of bill add a weapon le our relations for help le advise these Somalia .
accordingly addition , M. project of bill Kelleher four things .
everything of first , he letter more clear et the M. system of the fact providing Status of Funds of la the early that he there speaks principles for this that remembered reserves a criminal Joint , this est Island le Island say a criminal who can be . either Way seaway of implementation fact charge , namely Way seaway of statement tabled of serious .
second , M. run who themselves est seen agree Status the show expect le M. less gentleman year prior of power introduce a new request .
estimates , des calls le Status commission fact cases of refusal or of - themselves agreements normal Way written acting , le less that Status Commission national of des lib�rations , no receive a G .
participation , M. project of bill indiquera more clear that Status the took slight effect of sceller M. file et non of effacer M. fact that he there took privileged principles .
although that all these measures recommend important fact firms Island executory , I like me focus Alberta sur la question of la the of des appropriate father .
la Act sur M. the news makes gentleman system of the for des former appropriate who were studies that they menaient provision a life rang�e .
accordingly under of Clairvaux bill , M. the news of des appropriate can be scell� themselves they receiving their the representations of la Commission national of des lib�rations , .
he regardless of no not remember that M. scellage no efface not Status principles , not more that he no purge M. the news .
la principles est after everything gentleman fact the .
M. the news can be r�ouvert sur la request of M. General General , when this est streets M. interest of la justice or of la security national .
honourable senators , la the no est not leave investigations .
she M. est acting if a person took fact evidence of a conduct irr�prochable et no took not perp�tr� of Crime during a period peace .
streets M. cases of conviction punissables sur statement tabled of serious , he est necessary of do evidence of a conduct irr�prochable during three years , after bringing purg� his worth .
M. project of bill C Island 7 specific clear that means right M. benefits of amendes .
streets M. cases of actions criminal more serious , la period of standing est of five years .
la Commission national of des lib�rations , must order that M. against took fact evidence of a conduct irr�prochable during whole this period .
prior of grant a the , remembered behalf Status Police of all des communities where took unique M. against le M. during of des five recent years .
he regardless of whether that Status broad majority of des r�habilit�s continues of meet Status bill .
since 28 years , nearly of gentleman off of created of r�habilitations were summer length et , of this number , only gentleman little more of 6 40,000 were summer r�voqu�es le suffer of a new criminal .
means represents gentleman rate of success of more of 97p. % .
M. project of bill C Island 7 door Alberta sur des appropriate father , who are gentleman growers Subcommittee Island group of M. more great group of des short le Status the .
M. Department of M. General General took recently respected that le M. during of des 28 recent years , 4 200 appropriate father sons disposable a the .
banking 114 of these appropriate , namely in % , were seen their the r�voqu�e for bringing places a another child sexual .
these program story that , successful , single gentleman growers number of appropriate father r�habilit�s arise M. risk of r�cidiver .
however , too growers this number either Island he , he est significant of reduce this risk le M. level M. more devastating possible .
M. project of bill C Island 7 we help le M. do .
M. project of bill C Island 7 speaks support sur of des measures who were already summer taken for protect des children et other persons vulnerable .
thus , gentleman not significant took summer fact fact 1994 , when remembered took movement M. the National of filtrage .
this system based sur M. Centre of line of la Police Canadian , M. CIPC or , p English , CPIC .
thanks le M. CIPC , des goes were access le of des information who their amounts of eliminate des the father of children of their and of short le of des Post who des the le contribute representations of children .
la creation of this system took fact follow le of ministers consultations representations of bodies of services le des children , of authorities school et of responsible of services social , of bodies volunteers approval that des Clubs of G et daughters of M. Canada , des operation Fr�res et des Grandes S9urs , B�n�voles Canada , thereby that Status Police et of des bodies of assistance le des victims .
these bodies were said that Status might of M. the news was gentleman discussed significant of gentleman process of filtrage more review .
M. the National of filtrage est M. consultation of la cooperation between des bodies of services le des children , des enhanced policiers , M. Centre of line of la Police Canadian , thereby that des departments of M. General General , of la health et of la Assistance .
M. the National of filtrage took given of good results .
M. project of bill C Island 7 will M. the National of filtrage fact corrigeant a rates who took summer d�cel�e .
accordingly effect , M. file of gentleman serious , r�habilit� can times le M. attention le M. during of a might of brings representations of M. Centre of line of la Police Canadian , or CIPC , le of des purpose of filtrage .
streets M. state present of des things , M. General General took M. power of just M. file of gentleman serious r�habilit� et of M. information le of des purpose federal with M. administration of la justice , consumer for M. filtrage .
as des worked of this kind are the of M. system of M. CIPC et the le share streets a Basic of data scell�e , they no apparaissent not le M. payment of a research of brings .
this system of protection , this est informed this that designed Status Act sur M. the news .
streets Status most of des cases , indeed , these worked should be the when he there took " .
however , when a person questions his area le gentleman station of confidence et that his file door le grounds that he there avoided gentleman level increase of risk for a class specific of persons vulnerable , a material est , .
des ministers of la Assistance et des , agree federal , provincial et territorial themselves are all hour sur this developed meetings of their meeting fact October 1998 .
gentleman group of workplace of officials servants took carefully des means of better protect des children et took submitted ten recommendations fact this sense le des ministers bring .
these ten recommendations were all summer various et are fact emerging of be implemented fact due .
he took summer proposed , between other , that des worked of des appropriate father having fact M. subject of a the recommend outstanding accessibility for M. filtrage of des short le of des Post of confidence .
M. General General of M. Canada , with M. support of la Minister of la Assistance , took 1992 meetings of la meeting of 1998 of determine M. better average of M. do fact tabled with all his Provincial provincial .
M. project of bill C Island 7 was Status next reading logical .
as I M. I fact noted more tard , he provides that , when M. remembered the of M. CIPC M. file of gentleman serious , follow le his the , remembered the le Status hearts gentleman indicateur .
some say that this extent putting le M. dealing of M. objective basic of la Act sur M. the news et this est a concern serious , although heard .
we want that M. system of the operating well .
however , he themselves branch of a material circonscrite et very who , according me , run only .
des ministers of la Assistance of all des governments were seconded this principle .
if we no take not this extent , we now of look des consequences negative of la the who would gentleman licensing , le themselves frayer gentleman move moving gentleman station of confidence representations of children or of other persons vulnerable .
he eliminated attend Way Status bill et Way Status political of M. CIPC of themselves serve of this criminal without Authorized .
he 50 always obtain M. consent of M. against , et this last speaks always M. choice of discussed his request themselves he no wish not will his file le M. body who ask le M. filtrage .
for themselves ensure that M. against est and with . , remembered to his training four le Status request of session of des scell�s sur M. file subject Way Status the .
finally , M. General General show can that Status information of M. the est , .
reflecting pr�cisera des conviction them who able be and thus that des factors who manage taken fact consideration Way M. General General for determine of M. American of desceller M. file .
honourable senators , you you the can Island be that M. Committee Standing Standing of des affairs legal et Constitutional took held gentleman very good debate sur this who was then M. project of bill C Island setting during et after Status look of M. General General fact June last et le M. opportunity of a meeting very the fact September .
i like negative Status contribution very suggest of M. Senator Nolin .
M. Committee was particular interested Way des are of children et of other persons vulnerable et Way M. raised specific of la list of des conviction them whose he est issue streets this project of bill .
i am sure that M. great workplace of M. Committee eliminated proposal le M. Senate when M. Committee take le new this project of bill , who est now M. project of bill C Island 7 .
he est significant of recognize that M. project of bill C Island 7 comes themselves add le of des measures already taken Way M. government for improve Status protection of des children .
these provisions required le Status recommendation agreement of des ministers of des provinces et of des territories .
firms were received M. support agreement of all des parties le M. another place .
firms are federal , I think , with la concern common that were all des MPs , similar of do everything this who est possible for protect our children et des adults vulnerable of des pr�dateurs father who a le their civil of M. wonderful .

he no there took not if long , of my experience , he no there had not of ground between Status basic British et Status basic Canadian , although that Status went of M. Canada retain d�coul� of gentleman status particular of dominion .
accordingly parliamentarian that person danger who took scaffold M. day et who took summer fair until le M. age of 13 years le Status Barbade , streets des Antilles so et who took d�m�nag� le M. Canada , I I written this opinion experience .
from des years more later , after bringing including that , as speaking of origin British experience le M. Quebec , I no pleased never a found Qu�b�coise , I I Dr. M. Quebec for M. Ontario , this who fact of me a r�fugi�e of home des " any laine " .
i think strong that M. remembered sape my Canadian et that I inform M. do points et M. bringing .
honourable senators , good number of people le M. country , there including of des ministers , pr�conisent M. clause of la the section of M. Canada .
i respect this by constitutional of d�molition of M. Canada .
they , a called against democratic et popular le M. dealing of M. aristocratie , but their Appeal fact favour of M. principle of la democracy est superficiel , without et very companies .
they arise M. absolutisme le M. Public as themselves he themselves mark of M. former absolutisme of des the , everything fact bad attempt the of M. absolutisme present of des Cabinets et of des courts of inclusion proposing global .
these d�molisseurs are fact situation of Customs by et legal .
they induisent M. Public fact complete because that M. Canada no took never had of aristocratie or of structure political aristocratique .
instead Status difference of this who themselves est past le M. Assembly Island Economic , M. aristocratie no took never fact part of la structure social , economic , military or political of M. Canada .
M. Canada , as new peuplement , no took never known of conditions social who were executive Status creation of security aristocratiques .
M. Canada no took never met des conditions studies le M. predatory of M. principle aristocratique , namely M. principle h�r�ditaire known fact Queen Subcommittee M. the of bill of la primog�niture , nor poss�d� Status structure aristocratique necessary for ensure Status protection of des persons et of des property , namely Status protection of la life et of la freedom continuing Way M. aristocrate le his vassaux fact the of their loyalty et of their services .
instead M. Assembly Island Economic , this structure aristocratique et political took natural M. not le M. governmental of M. time le gentleman government with responsibility yesterday , model that M. Canada took department early M. early of his history Way M. directly of M. system of des parties policies .
my culture political themselves done of a the section et of des graduate parliamentarians so who were given le des Antilles so des more one down legislation of M. as of la the the .
these graduate parliamentarians were extensive le M. removal of M. trade of des esclaves fact 1807 et le M. removal of M. call proprement said fact 1833 .
M. discussed importance of gentleman government came responsible of M. Parliament of la Privy est M. build of M. cabinet of funds name of find , with la confidence of M. Parliament , of des rural policies rather that support , administrative or military le of des problems et le of des conflict Agriculture .
la political est Status solution le Status most of des problems .
M. term of la political est Status more vast contribution of our system British .
la political , this est also established et grant of des appointment et of des and policies .
honourable senators , la Barbade est a party when whose M. legislative legislative , who took summer established fact 1639 , est Status more teachers le M. outside of M. Assembly then
she approach learned with la langue RCMP et Cuba M. the , who are all two of des the et all two of des over non so .
i am very sense le M. Parliament of la Privy et no wish of no institution r�publicaine for M. Canada .
i no like not that M. remembered move of do of M. Canada a r�publique .
i me there opposerai always , as I I taken of M. do .
des Canadians no are not less free nor less independent that des citizens of no regardless whatever r�publique .
this est a real tragedy that of des schools , of des graduate policies et , especially , of many politicians sign of population M. beautiful Canadian constitutional of M. Canada .
some were said that this was very for gentleman country .

M. hon. Joan to :
honourable senators , I I a issue le question et , if M. Senator Cools me M. allows , a rectification le contribute .
i no think not that anyone incurred much des accomplishments Mr. Black streets M. area of M. plans .
however , if you �tudiez des annual financial of des businesses that he control , you you that M. number of jobs took reduced et non increased streets des newspapers that he control , since that he fact took fact M. formal .
my issue pertains la nature of des the that , of after M. Senator , he citing appropriate that of des Canadians my of la share of governments foreign .
he there took series difference between des the promote the , as M. payments of , or Status received of honour , et Right who compound of 22 who M. longer gentleman l�gislateur of gentleman country abroad .
la chamber of des member est a legislative legislative .
she no took can Island be not tree of power that our Senate , but we caught much well control for whether that this no est not a something be that of be l�gislateur .
M. hon. Senator broad Island she a difference between des two food of ground et estimated she that he there took rather of des necessity compensation , Chair given that a cinquantaine of years were past since that a person huge streets M. sector Museum of des media took recipient Status dignity of the ?
i draw Way example Mr. Kenneth Thompson took launch the of same M. payments of his father le M. Late of Liberal Thompson .
M. Senator Cools :
i thank M. hon. Senator of his issue .
accordingly this who relative des has et des governments foreign , I wish le mention that I no small not Status members of Queen as gentleman government abroad .
i no place too table headed Island dealt .
she est Status Privy of M. Canada , my members .
when I I fact my coming le M. Senate fact 1984 , after bringing summer escort�e M. term of Clairvaux care , I I implemented Status document sur la Bible et I I came papers , et this est le this members that I I came M. papers of meet .
la Privy of M. Canada no est not gentleman government abroad .
i I can Island be difficulty before des comments of M. hon. Senator .
if this est M. cases , I him place expected of contribute of other Request .
from des has are Commons everything M. time .
he there took of des Canadians who members streets of des down legislation across streets M. world .
M. hon. Senator themselves special certainly of a meeting of M. group , le commentary we we attended all des two he there took few months , et where I I met of des citizens parliamentarians who members le of des down legislation of some country baltes , I think .
la chamber of des member est gentleman the , not a legislative legislative , et he there took series huge difference between a legislative legislative et gentleman the .
la chamber of des member est a party institution .
she est a of des more former of M. world .
this est can Island be because that many of my friends face were served le Status chamber of des member , but I appartiens le M. group of des Canadians who . many of Alternative for this chamber .
reflecting me took national , when I route small daughter , le Status Barbade , that when everything M. rest had the , he many always Status possibility of fact call le Status chamber of des member .
i no amendments not le M. movement who explain that M. remembered Terrorism replacement le colleague 1999 des by so , there including Status chamber of des member .
finally , for this who est of des has , I right that they are supporting .
he there took of des has who new of des welfare et of other not .
he there took of des has who those of des advantage , of other not .
he there took of des has who new gentleman valued , of other not .
he there took whole a professional of has .
i look M. Senator le themselves the le me for forward a proposal Authorize sur M. study of des welfare the et M. regarding of des Canadians le these welfare .
streets this proposing global where M. remembered performance of des welfare h�r�ditaires , I no think not that funds name authority too of welfare h�r�ditaires le M. Canada .
i no I not successful le fact find of new .
i I have gentleman number already of welfare of chevaliers streets my bring .
des � who me are immediately came le M. spirit are obviously Liberal Thompson him Island even et , although heard , M. former Island Prime Minister of M. Canada , Mr. MAXWELL . B . in , who , as we M. know , took summer appointed vicomte fact 1941 .

he seems that these persons no can nothing do for themselves protect against these violent .
i no wish not le points Status question of M. control of des weapons le fire , but he naturally gentleman time where Status community crop themselves prot�geait le M. average of fusils of whaling .
reflecting no themselves attaquait not le des farmers of fear of be comments .
M. Code criminal attend of themselves serve of brouillard of poivre for themselves protect .
des Columbians of des central added et , travel , des Columbians of des regions , no were not of other means of themselves protect et they are participate terrifi�s Way all these stories of saucissonnage , of effraction , of announced et of Dr. whose they leaving speak .
if M. Minister no anyone not M. file for M. deal , perhaps Island be could Island he fact discussion with his colleagues , consumer M. Minister of la Assistance .
from des measures are Island tracked fact dispute , who biological help des persons whose remembered which Status rates le themselves protect firms Island executory ?

M. Code criminal allows le des courts of themselves show very take shown des chronic of these violent .
i understand dealing des problems concerns Way M. Senator .
M. problem keeps can Island be fact part le M. established of des Relations family , le M. during of des recent decades .
instead a era , a family my or crop finest rely become a family the , if well that des persons seniors were less often livr�es le firms Island executory , far of des other members of la family .
this est a will , but I think that , if we comparions Status situation present le similar of he there took 30 years , we constaterions that he there took today today many more of persons seniors who living opposed le M. held of do part of a family the .
la protection that M. Senator request est can Island be , for this miss reason , more necessary of our days .

M. hon. Lowell Murray :
i try do of my better .
honourable senators , he themselves branch of la second level of gentleman speech that I I began le deal M. 4 November fact - M. debate , le M. behalf of M. Opposition , of funds name , sur M. project of bill C Island 6 .
prior of remedy streets M. great of M. regarding , I like involved a inexactitude that I I commise streets my speech of M. 4 November . That the of des efforts who were summer facts streets M. past Way various parties policies fact view of disabilities streets Status Charter Canadian of des rights et freedom gentleman right le Status life private .
i I takes Way complete Mr. Chr had summer M. Minister of la Assistance of M. government Trudeau prior des election of 1979 .
gold , he no fact est nothing .
Mr. . Chr est become Minister of la Assistance when M. government Trudeau took retired M. power fact risks .
always streets my speech of M. 4 November , I I others a parenth�se le comments of M. uniqueness will of des data of M. comments .
la question took summer raised more tard today today meetings of la statement of senators of our colleague , M. Senator Milne .
i I mentioned of la campaign fact during , who could takes Status proc of la bill proposed Way that has Laurier , the Status information of des information gain et le uniqueness Privy tax le M. opportunity of gentleman comments .
instead M. era , I me route opposed Way principle le this that Status bill either be .
since , of des Canadians indign�s Way this decision me were written Island et same , streets some cases , these people were the Island western of des people that Status g�n�alogie interest .
my response , that I the le this day , had summer Status significant : that remembered us the these ' of protection , et we des report , run he est asked le M. Parliament of change Status bill .
but , sur M. principle General , I the my decision .
i estimated that should remain confidentiels all information gain et private , far Way M. government streets M. environment of gentleman comments , sur la medical of a bill the Status information of des these satisfy .
i estimated , Way principle , that we should avoid of change Status bill le Status manner .
after everything , le M. governmental of des years , des issues raised streets M. framework of des the are become of more fact more indiscr�tes , et this no est not because that des people d�c�dent that M. government can themselves respected the of his accountability of meet Status information promise le these persons .
this est my view , honourable senators .
streets of des room approval that M. Senate , we should we hold sur our training opposite le des dialogue be of some historians , knowledgeable fact science social et journalists of we small that M. right of officers et of information of des satisfy should M. just sur all des other rights learning .
this est why I I pr�conis� that we envisagions of disabilities gentleman right le Status protection of des information gain streets Status Charter Canadian of des rights et Freedoms .
i issue fully that we we here gentleman find or a the between two principles raises , M. gentleman Chair M. access le M. line et M. another Status protection of des information gain .
as for everything another find of principles , he must trying of find gentleman just inclusion .
this the of principles or of values process also streets M. project of bill whose we caught before .
as I me am committed le M. do , I I met gentleman number number of parts interested or the Way this project of bill or I I had with firms of des unemployment 27 or still I I read real their ' .
i no I not policy of notice le M. regarding of this project of bill .
i no I not your time today today fact make of include M. Richard that they manage asked le give before M. Committee , I fact am sure .
however , I like gallery some of des prices issues sur reasons M. Committee show themselves Lavoie .
honourable senators , he there took series mind extraordinary same home M. government et his examination ownership le whether if this project of bill themselves youth le M. sector of des care of health et how .
M. Senator Kirby , M. for of M. project of bill , could well whatever speak of Clairvaux issue when he certain gentleman term le M. debate fact second reading .
however , he show do better that this that he took fact streets his statement few who serving le the 120 of des 16 of M. Senate of M. 4 November where he took demagogic :
honourable senators , M. project of bill C Island 6 putting themselves apply le all des areas of Business , regardless of la setting of des businesses .
means understand also M. sector of la health .
he putting allow of protect des information gain fact equity of health who were summer tax , used et information streets M. framework of activities trade .
Mr. . government et M. Department of M. CRTC were indicated for their share that M. project of bill no themselves youth not le des doctors , le des entitled et le des hospital .
i wish le say that this developed of view est line fact issue et , p fact , could Way of many parts interested et their examination legal .
this est M. cases Way example of M. Association Canadian of des care of health , who represents des hospital of M. Association medical Canadian , of M. Association medical of M. Ontario et of M. Department of la health of M. Ontario .
he themselves branch headed of bodies who were gentleman developed of view diam�tralement opposed sur M. investigate of M. project of bill et this that remembered should fact do .
yet , they are of agreed sur gentleman developed , namely that M. sector of la health no can living with M. ; et Status mind negotiations this project of bill fact this who relative his due le M. sector .
la mind Her fact part of M. less of M. fact that M. project of bill est fiscal themselves apply le des " activities trade " .
that stand Island remembered Way headed ?
reflecting said streets M. project of bill that a " Business commercial " est :
obviously Business process thus that everything offence . who are gentleman uniqueness trading ...
this definition no est not very proposal .
yet , remembered me words that des laws federal are pleines of are who are almost identiques le similar Island side fact this who took truck le M. Business commercial .
M. idea est that remembered suggests le des courts M. experts of determine streets each cases this who engaged a Business commercial .
M. hon. Fernand Robichaud ( His Honour M. Speaker Acting ) :
honourable senators , M. time of speak of M. Senator Murray took period .
leave est Island she leave le M. hon. Senator of continue ?
from des Senators :
from agreed .
M. Senator Murray :
i thank des honourable senators for their very .
frankly , I no me am never agreement le Status rule who knew le alone minutes M. Robertson of M. Senator who answer .
i no me route not realized account that I sworn past tree of time sur la first part of my Robertson .
i no fact I more for very long .
la question est of whether if Status relationship doctor Island men , streets Status extent where he there took of des serious , or Status relationship Hospital Island men , yet a read streets Status extent where he there took of des serious , are of nature commercial .
that firms M. recommend or non , he there took novice same gentleman problem .
i true :
according M. AMC , he no there took not really average of do a ground between M. Business commercial et M. Business of care of health of a way who evidence of themselves ensure that des information words streets M. file medical recommend subject le of des rules different of Right reflect are the des other information .
that same if a ceremony ground was possible , M. dilemma citing M. same for M. government because citing Island he opinion that des worked Carstairs no recommend subject le no rule ?
otherwise said , des bodies who . currently of M. line sur la health able Island they has that they no are not subject le des provisions of M. project of bill C Island gallery because that this line fact part of M. file of health ?
as you M. know , M. executive C Island gallery est 22 who had summer days le this project of bill le M. opportunity of la session certain .
la be themselves going :
accordingly under of gentleman becomes regime , des worked of health bound subject le of des criteria less high that those who were during for des information tax streets M. environment trading .
this est headed M. requires of gentleman developed of view .
la same view est Parliament Way M. Association Canadian of la health , who represents des hospital .
she themselves tax sur a view legal that she took obtenue of M. practice of lawyers Heenan Blaikie of Montreal , who specific this who following :
... non only M. requires " Business commercial " est Island she very , , but she est also totally the le our notice streets M. environment of M. system of health of today today .
instead M. during of des recent years , M. system of health est become gentleman Lawrence of services if project et if companies that whole extent designed le mean acting inclusion " Business commercial " of M. system of health le des purpose of M. project of bill C Island gallery are acting le of des results illogiques , or et said .
i no wish not changed exag�r�ment Status question but , p rule general , he est le my notice just of say that des bodies of M. area of la health whose des activities are clear et indubitablement of renvoi trading themselves face le this project of bill et looking that everything M. sector of la health the le his provisions .
when I talking of " these " bodies , I wish say between other des pharmaciens , des Federal et des businesses who . , 116 et vendent of des data of M. area of la health , Subcommittee a form amount or another , et some bodies of research et universities whose des activities include gentleman in trading .
they serious that M. accountability of obtain M. consent of des people prior of information of des data fact equity of health est too on�reuse .
instead their notice , this requirement study serious their business le meet gentleman body of line make designed le discussions le a wish political et le a wish management streets M. area of la health .
they extra same hear that this project of bill themselves the Way gentleman an serious of la research medical le M. country .
M. Ontario Campaign Association rejected that M. project of bill est to with la Act sur des doctors et Status Act sur M. consent le des care of health .
instead their notice , des laws provincial should bringing us .
all these persons common that M. predatory of protocoles give citing more effective that a bill federal for ensure Status protection of des information sur des care of health .
instead M. hour present , I inform say that of other persons well le M. fact of des laws provincial no are not also have .
accordingly fact , remembered said sometimes that Status bill inquiry est a bill sur M. access le des information rather that sur la protection of des information .
i no wish not say Way headed that M. Ontario Campaign Association et M. Association Canadian of des care of health no themselves interest not le Status protection of des information sur des care of health .
he there took worse headed the le M. level of des values , or le everything M. less of des words .
des purposes yesterday Way these groups arise of des concerns that I in of institutionnelles opposite le M. business le run , le meet et le improve M. system of care of health .
they concerned that this project of bill freine Status cooperation between des areas Public et Privy fact this who took truck le M. funding or le Status benefit of des care of health .
i I same read streets gentleman of des purposes that means could prevent Status Pl Bleue or M. Bouclier an of M. Canada from obligations their responsibilities fact Ontario streets M. area of des care of health .
he citing , according themselves , difficult , engineers same contempt for M. government federal of implement fact implementation des recommendations of his Council Museum sur M. infostructure of la health who took panacea his report fact February 99 .
instead M. while , we we des leading concerns very by Way M. Association medical Canadian et Way M. Association to Canadian .
M. Association medical Canadian says that Status protection of la information of M. file medical of M. men must M. just sur whole another consideration .
she wherever that this project of bill est low .
she judge that M. criminal of M. Association Canadian of normalisation sur cetera themselves tax M. project of bill est inad�quat fact this who took truck le M. sector of la health et she believes , as she M. took demagogic , that M. project of bill seems bringing M. access le M. line for value the .
M. Association to Canadian we took demagogic that we must Chief M. project of bill sur several other points substantial .
she says that M. project of bill C Island 6 no , not le answer le des class basic for protect des Canadians against M. bad brings of information gain regarding their health Way of des management high et tertiaires of Clairvaux line .
M. project of bill C Island 6 creates can Island be of supports several words of M. government fact equity of trade the , said M. ADC , but she believes that M. Senate must do something something for Chief et strength M. project of bill fact this who relative des information gain fact equity of health .
M. Association medical Canadian et M. Association to Canadian were all two individuals of des amendments that firms want that we is et who , of after this that I fact I including , incorporeraient paid streets this extent federal their own . of protection of des information gain .
honourable senators , M. Committee est purpose le a job difficult et project .
before these leading who themselves face learned , even streets M. area of la health , he citing made of say that Status truth opinion something share between these two leading et that M. government est probably had le establish gentleman just inclusion with his project of bill C Island 6 .
he citing made of fact happen le this concluded or of produced regard point , but this citing really too easy .
corporation , M. Committee show be of appropriate M. ; et Status mind le comments of M. - of M. project of bill le M. sector of la health .
this est gentleman area really too significant .
la protection of des information gain fact equity of health est too important for allowing this sector streets Status mind .
he est clear that des professionals streets this area no can M. accept because they we M. were said .
if M. project of bill no est not clarifi� , Auschwitz Island side risk , a read passed , of be more often according that therefore .
nil of between we no wish that he fact either thus .
even if we can eliminate M. ; who exists ownership le M. due of M. project of bill , that r�pondons Island we le M. Association medical Canadian et le M. Association to Canadian , who insistent order that Status extent legislative either reduced the ?
should Island we trying of apply des provisions le everything M. sector of la health , brilliant trading that non trading ?
if we M. advanced , we Island we recommendation M. power constitutional of act of la hallmark ?
finally , he must participate hear health Canada relatively le this issue .
for tree that I side , nil representing of health Canada no est ratify evidence meetings of des hearings of M. Committee of la chamber of des House .
M. Committee et M. Senate must benefit of des moment of M. Department of la health relatively le all des aspects of M. project of bill who end M. sector of la health .
surely , I no wish not le this that M. Minister up evidence , but M. Committee should certainly various of des officials servants of M. Department of la health le come look this extent legislative , Chair given that similar Island side visit Status health .
honourable senators , we we many of workplace le do .
either Island we le Status job , but no . not des things .
no we imposons not of get artificiels when he themselves branch of a issue also important .
this read Island side , we no we not le we concerned of a was .
we can take M. time necessary .
honourable senators , I you thank of your to .
M. hon. Minister Finestone :
honourable senators , I I share with great interest des criticism the of our hon. colleague .
he we reminds et support M. importance of la question of M. right le Status life private , probably , M. right that remembered us suggests tranquilles .
i think that this est M. judge Brandeis who took demagogic that we recall M. right that remembered us suggests tranquilles , et I am well of agreed with him .
la question est of whether if this project of bill answer le des two criteria core .
M. Prime est gentleman Carstairs economic et M. Aboriginal relative la justice social .
gentleman great number of des senators who themselves friends today today fact opposite of me include M. dilemma who challenge le budget justice economic et justice social of a manner who either equitable for themselves et for des persons that we we M. privilege of retirement fact this chamber , thereby that for all des persons shown reasons we - gentleman strong Stratton of responsibility .
honourable senators , this est with a wear whole particular that I talking today today of M. project of bill C Island 6 .
i me recall that , of M. time where I I le M. another place , he themselves why M. project of bill C Island gallery , An sur la protection of des information gain et des documents on .
my wear est of tree more vast that M. a of des responsibilities et of des duties whose I am Status more proud took summer of serve fact parliamentarian that chairman of M. Committee Standing of des rights of la person et of la condition of des persons lack of M. another place .
we we held of des hearings sur a vast needed of issues regarding Status life private et , p 1997 , we we prepared gentleman report entitled : " Position life private :
where themselves i Status border ? "
we we heard of des stories enough troublantes le M. regarding of M. single extend le des persons lack et of des rights of la person who no were not well protection .
we we heard speak of des challenges that represents Status new technology le M. level of la protection of des rights of des citizens of fact prevent some of will streets their life private et of using des information that they d�couvrent le of des purpose the .
our research me were fact truth des many this discussion that includes this issue .
he rest still many of workplace le do for strength our rights basic .
today today , I traiterai fact particular of la part 1 of M. project of bill et of la protection of des information gain streets M. sector Privy .
means no tax fact nothing my item ownership le Status second part of M. project of bill who door sur des documents on .
des provisions of la part 2 of M. project of bill are essential for assist M. trade the who est become if significant for M. economy Canadian present et whose M. importance no Kelleher that increase le M. governmental of des years .
for M. payment , I like especially me focus sur la definition of la protection of la life private et of M. use of des information gain .
des provisions of M. project 28 C Island 6 designed le ensure Status protection of la life private future gentleman great not streets Status right leadership , especially le des influence of those who constataient M. get need of better protect this right .
accordingly existing des principles of la protection of des data recognized internationalement le des businesses corporations of responsible federal , M. project of bill 8 moving gentleman regime hard of protection of la life private .
from des laws sur la protection of des information gain et sur M. trade the are already fact emerging of be forward fact Europe , streets M. Union markets , le M. OECD , p Nova Island plus et fact Australia .
des Americans are concerned because that they no care not of suffer specific of protection of des information trade .
they �largissent currently Status broad of Clairvaux protection for power strength their Business commercial .
we we also need of do of M. trade , honourable senators .
i am pleased that we we dirigions streets this seaway thanks le this project of bill .
i reminds le des honourable senators that Status protection of des information gain no est not a something le commentary remembered can think after encourage streets a society democratic .
M. annual le Status protection of la life private , Chapter Phillips , run handed of these issues , of same that of Right who within of la Act sur M. access le M. line .
these two laws can sometimes remedy fact find , but all two were for accountability of protect all des citizens .
la Act sur la protection of des information gain act Status raising , M. use et Status keep of information gain Way of des graduate initiative .
she est very self et took summer effective until here .
instead my notice , M. annual Phillips themselves est very well , of Clairvaux visible .
M. annual le Status protection of la life private of M. Canada took contrary that Status strength who anime des corporations d�centes est M. Alternative of M. principle of equity .
we must we deal des absolutely des other with gentleman level reasonable of Alternative .
we no must not we the fact cachette with of des information that we can using against of other persons .
M. project of bill C Island 6 designed le ensure M. Alternative of this principle of equity et of d�cence .
instead my notice , M. project of bill took balance M. inclusion do who themselves thing between Status need for des businesses Forces of bringing access le of des information gain for exercise their activities et Status need for all des citizens of function Status raising , M. use et Status keep of des information who des step .
he est arrived le good number of between we of bringing a he le des letters who d�borde of new not of everything kind .
we we made then le whatever address we we taken gentleman abonnement or still ones 500 we we fact le M. average of a to of Vote , of hallmark that we , this that we the le our door , streets M. s et Way M. councils of our telephone , et we no caught not me .
this who we am , this est that our letters recommend wheat .
each of we est gentleman subject of trade , a marchandise .
streets whatever extent want Island we function this marchandise for protect of des information gain ?
M. own for establish gentleman inclusion est obviously streets M. section in M. subject of M. project of bill .
i this that Status extent took need of be amend�e et clarifi�e .
i know if we moving do gentleman Iraq et we hear , but I pleased certainly more le M. private if this issue Command M. subject of gentleman review more review .
des provisions sur la protection of la life private recognize that we some streets a proposing where Status technology , of more fact more Status foreign et M. trade of information .
this est gentleman hold that he no compensated not remember .
M. project of bill C Island 6 no est not a the for all des threat le Status life private reflect compound opposite all des corporations democratic good , but he themselves be sur gentleman discussed significant who est Status possibility that of des information gain recommend the le of des goes le M. Canada .
M. project of bill receive le des consumers of des rights fact this who relative des information gain who des step , everything fact open M. need concern of des businesses of officers et of using these information .
des consumers must bringing confidence Island this est very significant with Internet Island et we must promote this confidence .
for that our businesses the et grandissent , firms must establish gentleman direct of confidence with those who materials their services .
Way therefore , la confidence that took M. doing that his information gain manage protection streets des financial on est participate basic .
accordingly same time , des efforts for protect des information Authorize sur of des individuals no must not standard the of des costs for des businesses .
la new extent legislative to that des businesses themselves conforment le M. together of practices field of single of M. line implemented le M. developed Way des representatives of M. industry .
des groups of defence of des consumers , des from , M. government et various areas of M. area of la health were summer potential for this extent legislative of M. Association Canadian of normalisation .
this est headed , I think , a broad regions of des concerns et of des needs le take fact consideration .
des practices field of single of M. line whose he est issue themselves " M. Code kind of M. Association Canadian of normalisation .
this criminal est fact effect since 1996 et est fight fact Regulations le M. project of bill .
he took summer implemented le M. developed Way Status society civil , des businesses , M. industry , des professionals et des Canada .
gentleman of des amendments citing whether fact M. priority because he themselves branch of a moment very broad who fiscal gentleman wide array of businesses trade le M. Canada .
this criminal makes des obligations of des businesses who . , composed et members of des information gain .
des businesses must leadership le des persons le substandard purpose des data are done , obtain their consent prior of using or of information des information , accountability le this that des information recommend well those who are necessary for des purpose reflect they must serve Island non not no regardless substandard purpose , but well des purpose reflect they were summer tax Island et protect des information Way of des measures of security that .
la standard national makes also M. right of des aid of des data of see et of involved their worked et of themselves . fact cases of problems .
these persons can themselves body le something gentleman streets M. company who seems using le bad escient or difficulty information des information et hold that gentleman responsible themselves handed of M. problem et cetera des measures Kyoto .
he there speaks without doubt gentleman debate sur des believe le contribute le M. project of bill for M. tribute more effective .
i reminds le des honourable senators that gentleman project of bill est welcome throughout streets his form original ; fact fact , regardless of things are parfaites fact this world well imparfait .
M. established of Clairvaux extent legislative we montrera streets ones sense we orienter for contribute of des amendments who to his effectiveness sur M. plan of la protection of des information gain everything fact open des interests raises of des businesses Forces streets whole Status extent of M. possible .
gentleman Senator took jurist a issue le M. regarding of M. together of des services of health .
i known M. AMC , et I think understand that she youth M. papers of Hippocrate , gentleman criminal of conduct et gentleman criminal of Ethics .
all des doctors , who et pharmaciens must themselves there act .
means no means not solution say that we must bringing everything gentleman , h�t�roclite of measures for advise whole maintained le M. right le Status protection of M. identity et of des information gain le M. Canada .
honourable senators , I I summer very pleased of see that remembered previous contribution of des change le M. project of bill presented le M. tributes le M. another place .
he there took privileged 16 amendments , et gentleman number number of between themselves were date le number of my issues et of my problems .
thus , la definition of des information gain took summer amend�e .
la proc est very important , because M. requires of now everything this who themselves states le gentleman year identifiable .
means themselves youth le of des things as des cam�ras of training , des cam�ras plac�es streets des the , des information Carstairs et dentaires , des information of renvoi no , des pharmacies who livrent des 1980 , et des research .

M. system of the of raised it established Way M. project of bill S Island 10 for M. armed following very ever M. model of M. system that M. Parliament took movement for des civil .
instead Status follow of a principles for M. criminal the , des hands military stay therefore M. power of obtain M. levy of �chantillons of marine the sur of des persons justiciables of M. criminal of voluntary military .

M. Code criminal est therefore clarifi� le regard regard since he there est said that Status something no took not le be their if M. lawyer of la Crown standing M. tribunal that M. associated it of la person line themselves wherever already streets Status per national of data g�n�tiques .
reflecting Foreign thus M. system more effective et remembered the des spending consequences occasionn�es Way Status raising et M. analysis fact opinion of des �chantillons of marine the this sur des appropriate serious .

accordingly addition , des �chantillons this fact under of gentleman mandate During of approval meet , showing le those who manage this for Status per of data after Status principles , are assortis of - of raised gain .
he eliminated therefore more difficult for Status RCMP of protect des rights le Status life private of des individuals , thereby that M. it Status Act sur M. raised Way des training g�n�tiques .
for avoid everything problem , remembered small now necessary of industry of new �chantillons of marine the each read that he there took series described for their inclusion streets Status per of data , this est Island le Island say after Status principles .

des conventions tax are particular important for M. Canada because that firms are directly related le M. trade Covenant of products et of services et that firms were therefore a impact direct sur their his economic say .
this impact est vast .

he exists some exon�rations for this who est of des interests thus that of des revenues sur des rights of author , des reading , des Lands et M. whether Island do .
la sign banning with M. Lebanon provides a avoid of tax of cent % sur des dividends 7 le a society who voting le M. less cent % of des Senators of la society who benefits des dividends et of per % streets all des other cases .
des natural of cent et des revenues sur des rights of author , des reading , des Lands et M. whether Island do manage purpose le gentleman rate of cent % et des interests le gentleman rate of cent % .
for M. house , gentleman tax of per % eliminated himself streets M. cases of all des dividends , interests et revenues , et some exon�rations are protection for des interests et des revenues sur des reading et des Lands .
la sign banning with la Bulgaria provides M. due of a avoid of tax of cent % sur des dividends tax le a society of le M. less cent % of des Senators of la society who benefits des dividends , et of per % streets all des other cases .
for this who of la sign banning with M. Portugal , a society must so le M. less per % of des Senators of la society who benefits des dividends for bringing right le a avoid of tax de10p. % sur des dividends .
a avoid of per % themselves rate streets all des other cases .
a avoid of cent % themselves rate also le des interests et revenues , le few proposed nearly for des interests .
accordingly this who took truck le M. Ouzb�kistan , M. rate of avoid of tax who themselves rate le des dividends tax le a society who voting le M. less cent % of des Senators of society who benefits des dividends eliminated of cent % et of per % streets all des other cases .
gentleman rate of cent % themselves rate le des interests et le des revenues , et gentleman tax of cent % eliminated pr�lev� sur des rights of author , des Lands , des reading et M. whether Island do .
la new sign banning with la , makes �10p. % Status avoid of tax who themselves youth le des dividends tax le a society of le M. less cent % of des Senators of la society who benefits des dividends , et le per % , similar who themselves youth streets all des other cases .

la discrimination based sur la nationalit� of gentleman origin est milk .
however , des measures incitatives as Status allow leave le des small businesses et M. Vote of tax for dividends whose education des Canadians no are not affected .
prior of late , I like me consider sur la question of des migrations of des taxpayers .

these proposals points le change Status Act of M. tax sur M. income of way le this that M. Canada Marine M. right of restrictions des gain progress Way des immigrants during their came here .
instead M. payment of tribute Public M. project of bill fact December last , M. Minister took deficit that M. Canada ren�gocierait his conventions tax for hold account of des new rules order of avoid Status opinion taxation .
thus , p left that these rules equipped strength of bill , M. Canada took process his conventions tax of manner le avoid Status opinion taxation le M. payment where des gain progress Way of des immigrants , prior their tributes , are , .
accordingly this who relative M. project of bill S Island 3 , des conventions with M. Luxembourg , M. Portugal , M. Lebanon et Status , quality account of la migration of des taxpayers .
however , des conventions with M. Ouzb�kistan , la Bulgaria , M. house et M. Khirghizistan no fact quality not account Chair given that firms were summer n�goci�es prior M. announced of des proposals .

i me committed of M. commitment taken streets M. speech of M. another " of ensure le this that des Armed Forces recommend fact extent of support M. role of M. Canada for coming le Status security streets M. world " .
the Island we however of Subcommittee Island Use Status extent streets commentary we caught held of honour regard commitment .
since 1988 , des spending so le M. payments of la defence national were reduced fact million still , 1966 after year , le M. developed that M. power of 500 of M. budget of la defence est today today le little nearly school le 22 of M. early of des years positions .
des means whose we doing for equipment M. material necessary et fact ensure M. face were summer particular affaiblis Way follow of - cut .
M. group of des forces Forces actives , who was of the 40,000 persons fact 1989 Island 1990 , should , according des additional , seven of 60 40,000 of here le Status end of M. fiscal financial fact during .
we no caught already more fact extent of B.C. of des separate combattantes for M. operating of water , namely M. floor acceptable for lead a partisan military issued .
according des data area Way M. Second , M. Canada themselves name le M. last valued of des country members for this who est of des cut of la the process et of des Armed creation et high of reserve .
he there fact took who law that Status end of la war sensitive took constitutional Status need of maintain a capacity military , et ongoing et took movement a interest of " the of peace " .
as I M. I often said fact this chamber , I think that they themselves trompent totally .
des threat le Status security et their sources were can Island be policy , but M. world of today today est were more instable , coupled et the that never .
la possibility of conflict ports et ports d�clench�s Way of des mouvements , to est always presented streets all des university of M. wonderful .
la threat of Special Way of des United ren�gats et of des groups television exists always .
honourable senators , I member le grounds that des impact international of des made of some United constitueront Status holds threat le Status security of M. Canada et of des Canadians streets gentleman future a .
that this either fact Africa , streets M. former Island Union Soviet , p Asia of M. South Island east , p America made or fact America of M. South , he sometimes that of des United themselves d�sorganisent , as remembered M. took scaffold already , for various reasons economic , technical or policies .
la d�sint�gration of gentleman State written gentleman Court of power that themselves empressent often of gap of des groups criminal or face who , le their around , the Status security of des other United .
reflecting wherever of des � of means streets M. former Island Union Soviet .
M. effritement of M. power Civil took fact life whole a series of activities sordides .
honourable senators , M. months last Way example , des authorities russes were agreement six persons le Vladivostok who themselves appr�taient le let of M. country six kilogrammes of its this for M. sell le M. outside .
regard its the of a building where M. remembered d�mantelait some parts of M. now early Soviet et of des face or of des groups criminal lend could M. using for " of des control India small certainly , but very destructrices .
this est le suffer of threat of this kind that we must remain the et maintain fact land gentleman good serving of Intelligence of security et a armed outside .
i committed M. government of his commitment shown des military , but I hope see more of further streets M. next budget federal .
M. speech of M. another specific des professional of M. government for M. arrived of M. new millennium .
reflecting said often that this Prime Minister et his government still of vision .
he there took great of special words streets M. speech of M. another sur la dispute le M. new millennium .
i issue that le several again remembered coordinating of assist , Way example , M. trade the et M. access le Internet , but means no engaged not a vision amount for tell M. future of M. Canada .
la economy of des economies means that all des economies become of more fact more interd�pendantes .
accordingly fact , closed , he no there speaks more this that remembered reserves a " economy say " .
he no there speaks more that a miss economy et gentleman single market .
des economies , des markets et Status competition no manage not problems Way des R national or ports .
he no there speaks more of R .
between Island time , all des investors et people of affairs international the aware le gentleman review examination who no avoided never summer possible previously , of all des economies very , there including similar of M. Canada .
des progress streets des establishing of des telecommunications , especially des progress streets M. trade the , compound that des investments can be Lands et of des decisions can be taken fact millisecondes .
des capital can remedy streets gentleman country or fact let fact gentleman deal .
M. year last , we we summer witnesses can Island be of M. Prime example of des impact of these forces et of M. trade the sur M. economy of des First of M. Asia of M. South Island east et of M. Pacific .
these important fuites of capital including gentleman ! of non Island confidence Way des investors international et Status community of des affairs .
des impact themselves compound feel of our days streets of des country individual , there including le M. Canada , et streets M. world world .
instead Status follow of la crisis crisis , M. during of M. expenditures Museum took the Way report le M. expenditures American then that des cambistes were out M. more of million American possible for themselves protect against des $ problems .
our exports moving M. part Island introduction were school then that Status crisis took victim a turn of des price of des products of Basic .
des capital et des businesses no are more linked Way Status s , M. time or des honourable national .
a economy or gentleman government who no themselves includes not as des banks , des financial , des courtiers fact values the et des departments of cotation streets des capitales financial M. sure can do M. subject , quickly et the , he est real , of sanctions very about .
even if we no for can Island be not means , he no fact remains not less that M. Canada no took not of another road that of enfiler this that remembered reserves gentleman diable corset economic " who shows le all that M. Canada est gentleman good place where b et do of des affairs le M. during of M. new millennium .
M. term of the eliminated of us this corset economic order of improve Status situation of M. Canada et of des Canadians le better answer of their class et of protect des things who are special for des Canadians et who compound part of our start of life , as Way example , our system National of care of health .
nevertheless that he fact either , le M. payment where we moving deal M. new millennium , M. Canada took great le do .
la debt amount of des levels federal , provincially et any est too fair et continues of fact .
our levels of rate personal future gentleman enormous regime .
accordingly despite of believe important who were summer concerning le M. during of des two recent decades , our economy understand always many of raise et of paperasserie .
we caught always develop , of des resources Natural .
approximately 40 % of M. cent of M. Canada continues of M. trade of our resources Natural .
he there took always of too many burden le M. trade , le M. Plan et le Status Education of la document Island of implementation le M. country .
accordingly despite of des progress challenges tell le M. during of des recent years , our available of Basic streets des areas of M. world of water , of des �gouts et of M. transportation , particularly streets des main cities , whose of des the et of des believe important .
we must do more fact view of improve our productivity .
we must fact do more streets des areas of M. education , of la research et of M. development order of become M. kind of society innovatrice et adaptable who putting non only life but who putting also their le M. during of M. next millennium .
he exists always gentleman gap large between this that M. Canada est et this that he could become .
instead regard regard , I committed M. government who took retired M. commitment streets M. speech of M. another of introduce of new a extent legislative designed le protect des information gain et trade streets gentleman as the et le recognize des from on .
from similar initiatives are essential if M. Canada et des Canadians want be fact extent of benefit fully of des potential billion Way M. Internet et M. trade the .
honourable senators , M. �vocation of M. additional of money me reminds that M. government themselves est committed streets M. speech of M. another le implement M. responsibilities sur des threat new reflect must do opposite des Canadians , as M. additional of M. money .
according M. Department of des Finance , of 5 le 17 billion of million , or as I M. I read streets M. newspaper this morning of 17 le 40 billion of million the each year the le M. Canada or Way M. councils of M. Canada .
M. Group of partisan financial sur M. additional of capital , who themselves composede 26 country , priorities M. Canada , la Commission markets et M. Council of cooperation of M. Gulf an , took talk fellow M. much of M. Canada .
la 1993 eye streets M. speech of M. another est that .
however , we we of M. hundreds sur la committees .
honourable senators , M. fact that M. speech of M. another talking insuffisamment of M. problem of M. immigration ill�gale le M. et Way M. Canada me took frankly many g�n� .
we know that order of be the during M. next millennium , M. Canada must continue of attention of des immigrants of M. world world .
he est however the that our country no atteigne not his objectives ownership le M. number of immigrants received .
M. Canada took tragic per % of immigrants of less fact 1998 that le M. during of M. year certain .
we to got of des difficulties system for attention of des workers et of des professionals knowledgeable .
however , means no means not that we - ports des influence sur M. problem programs of M. immigration ill�gale le M. Canada , p organization of various regions of M. world .
he themselves branch of gentleman problem get , whose des causes deep purpose streets our process of learning of M. status of refugee .
honourable senators , la the political Chalifoux difficult Status held of gentleman debate others et rationnel sur our policies et our proceedings related le M. status of refugee .
obviously person who lancerait gentleman becomes debate or who , fact issue M. means means term M. risk of be qualifi�e of will or of Montr Island the .
he no strong le nothing of novo that Status most of des immigrants ill�gaux no fuient not Status too for their great program , policies or other , but that this are of des refugee supporting improve their situation economic .
from same , he no strong le nothing of do noted that these immigrants ill�gaux were were Status bill Canadian et that this est a very concerned manner of start a new life le M. Canada .
i am enough proud that M. Committee Special recent sur la security that I I chaired retain and et studies M. problem programs of M. immigration ill�gale sixth le M. Canada prior that he no either very m�diatis� et no atteigne M. summum of his m�diatisation M. summer last .
M. immigration ill�gale le M. Canada threat M. integrity of whole our political of immigration .
those who looking le come le M. Canada fact themselves soumettant le all des proceedings wrong des ill�gaux des the .
reflecting knows also that a vast part of M. immigration ill�gale est M. fact of goes from .
non only these goes are particular m�chantes , but firms compound also pay very paid le des immigrants , le des professional financial et staff , M. privilege of come fact America of M. North .
gentleman great number of these immigrants are down le Status servitude for pay their high le des gangs criminal , le des " snakeheads " , who des were fact proceed the le M. Canada .
i I summer pleased of learned that gentleman judge of Europe had recently Judge four passeurs le of des suffered of year variant between 7 et 14 years .
according des documents tabled le M. tribunal , des passeurs sons extorqu� approximately gentleman created of million le their customers .
M. judge took daily their activities of m�chantes , and et the .
we no advanced of do le person fact the des influence sur M. immigration ill�gale .
those who education M. more of our laxisme et of our approach na�ve of la determination of M. status of refugee are des elements criminal who themselves livrent le this Business .
we must recognize that M. immigration ill�gale no est not gentleman problem speaking National .
if M. Canada wants Kyoto ever with M. government American for ports our border common during M. economy century , as remembered M. . streets M. speech of M. another , this modernization must do fact hallmark that our other R become less poreuses for des goes of passeurs .
instead my notice , la trying no opinion not streets our laws , but streets their due .
des problems of due were summer even le ground again .
M. study the Way M. group of workplace implemented sur feet Way M. former Minister of la note et of M. removal took signed that he no there had not of system effective fact hearts for obtain M. Alternative of des conditions cut Way des RCMP of immigration le des failed of M. status of refugee .
accordingly addition , M. Department of la note et of M. removal no sure not des came et a of la most of des failed of M. status of refugee , there including des thousands of persons who document a audition fact equity of immigration or who are Subcommittee M. encourage of a power .
reflecting speaks des training four of des failed of M. status of refugee le des points of novo order of power determine themselves they were gentleman the news or themselves they revenue a threat le Status security of M. State .
however , des RCMP of immigration were said le M. Committee Standing Special that Status Training et M. equipment dactyloscopiques whose they care are approval that des training that they taking are le all purpose practices consequences et of knows simply Iraq .
Way therefore , we we need non not of new laws or measures , but of a strongly political et of des resources necessary for implement fact implementation et apply des laws et des measures education .
la detention of immigrants ill�gaux est obviously a issue find .
tabling le des United Island United et le of other country , we no emprisonnons not des immigrants ill�gaux le less of bringing of des reasons of grounds that they are of des criminal or that they revenue a threat for Status security of M. State .
la Minister of la note et of M. removal themselves welcome le Status detention of des immigrants ill�gaux because that they no were nothing fact of difficulty .
she estimated therefore that des emprisonner citing of M. less step le Status Charter of des rights et Freedoms .
instead my sense Island et I know that this no est not a view popular Island des immigrants ill�gaux were fact something something of difficulty .
they were citizens et . according Status introduce Canadian of M. immigration et means should be a reason environment of des emprisonner until le their G respecting le Status learning of M. status of refugee .
however , M. process must be concerns .
des decisions must come fact time appropriate .
reflecting no can not so of des people during of des months because that remembered Monday of staff for off M. workplace by .
finally , honourable senators , I committed M. government of themselves be committed le strength Status capacity of la RCMP et of other bodies of total des threat le Status security public le M. Canada et of Kyoto with des forces of M. order of other country .
this est quite , but , I M. indicated , he must determine until where remembered can go .
yet headed , I am , of see des further streets M. next budget .

M. century who themselves on took summer International Way a off increase et of des massacres sanglants without precedent sector paid le M. nationalism inconsid�r� et le M. extr�misme to .
this naturally also gentleman century of progress without precedent .
des people who were written fact from no reconna�traient more M. world of today today .
he must expect that we we Somalia of des surely of M. 20 century et that des progress progress we , gentleman new century more just , unless d�chir� Way des means et des followed of nationalism et of very , where Status freedom economic et political eliminated whose .
if we we learned our surely , M. next century we r�servera le we et le M. world world of des potential inimaginables .
finally , honourable senators , streets M. world project moving cetera we we the , I wish la wish of des wish le M. government , le 22 le M. power currently et le those who him succ�deront .

as M. Prime Minister M. took demagogic :

M. hon. Deputy A . Kinsella ( Chief Deputy of M. Opposition ) :
honourable senators , prior of do my hear streets this debate sur M. speech of M. another , I like everything of first offer my congratulations et my best wish le his Excellency Status Gouverneure general le M. early of this new mandate .
these 407 Canadians side gentleman great privilege et a huge responsibility .
they serving le themselves recommendation 30 million of Canadians streets our Parliament .
citation few Island few of des issues who no cessaient of me come le M. spirit fact by sur M. speech of M. another et fact by sur M. Parliament : how themselves includes M. goals of M. State le des influence of des 407 parliamentarians parliamentarians who are strongly of M. soul ?
est Island this that Status practice of la freedom est more strong or more low ?
M. Canada that we the after our came le M. Parliament eliminated he better ?
accordingly response le these issues , I I summer natural le Status concluded that our Freedoms le M. Canada in sur la Basic of a hallmark of the of graduate basic .
la more high decision le M. country , la Court Supreme of M. Canada , est Status crime of farmers corrosives of la share of some cercles .
some of des farmers des more run against M. news are M. fact of MPs parliamentary of M. another place .
streets his response le M. speech of M. another , M. Chief of M. Party Reform streets M. another place le said follows :
... des courts were of more fact more empi�t� sur des the of M. Parliament le M. developed where remembered can say that he est contempt of out M. speech of M. another prior of bringing read 22 of des courts .
this well , honourable senators , some auditeurs were could find means , .
from other were can Island be found that this was a proposal technical or greater .
surely , I no I not found means , .
i no I not found more , that M. Chief of M. Party Reform streets M. another place themselves like le Iraq of criticism des courts of various local for des case outstanding streets their assessment of des measures taken Way des governments federal , provincial or territorial , Way report le Status Charter of des rights et Freedoms .
this was as if des courts were fact something hallmark responsible of M. English of la Charter Canadian of des rights et Freedoms .
i rappellerais quickly le des Canadians that he took special M. the of des two both of M. Parliament et of nine down legislation provincial for that either agreed Status Act section of section .
he regardless that we , parliamentarians , �valuions Status vision of M. government et des programs who fact 12 for determine if each of these programs the our courts streets of des reduced more difficult or less , .
when I I available M. speech of M. another , none streets this last no me took compelling that M. government had another something le offer that gentleman program Court .
M. government seems avoid des criticism policies concerns fact the this strategy .
he will le des courts des responsible , who consistent le out of des laws very call or too , .
M. government no took not word do evidence of enough of exercise , no took not had Status vision political et legislative necessary for do fact hallmark that M. Parliament operating of la manner portion le M. origin .
this who night more le M. independence et le M. role of M. power news these months time , this est that some levels of government presence difficulty understand M. report who should having between M. power organized et M. power news .
des honourable senators were follow very real M. judgment that took realized Status Court Supreme streets M. matter European .
this judgment the some rights the of include et took typical of des consequences very d�plorables streets Status province that I represents , M. New Island Money .
during this time , M. Prime Minister the Status possibility that Status Court Supreme retienne his judgment streets M. matter European enough long for allow le M. government of adopt des raise necessary for reduce des levels of , .
even if we - all le avoid this , , we convinced always le des taken with la question of living political streets des work of M. more senior tribunal of M. country , who shows clear how M. power organized making le role of M. muscle streets M. area news et representations of graduate who compound part of our form of democracy Parliamentary .
honourable senators , he est dangerous that gentleman Prime Minister request le des courts of do their work of manner le promote M. regime fact hearts .
la bill est Status bill .
he no must nor Status plier nor M. serving for that she consistent M. matter of gentleman party political who est le M. power .
instead this separate less strong between M. organized et M. news , he must add Status reaction ' of gentleman great number of parliamentarians , especially le M. another place .
since M. time that I am le M. Senate , I I welcome , et I doubt same that this either arrived , heard gentleman Appeal for address of emergency gentleman problem serious of renvoi political or Economic fact having remedy le Status clause of definition of la Charter .
yet , we hear often des people of M. another place say that Status clause of definition can be used for current gentleman problem .
M. Parliament must take well Access when a ceremony proposal est a .
honourable senators , I small M. Parliament as a of des three main graduate provision M. fiscal of la freedom le M. Canada .
gentleman review of M. number of days of session of des various down legislation et of des two both est strong to .
status le M. held that M. government took implemented le hold Status rentr�e Parliamentary regard fall .
la chamber of des House , M. institution who est the incarner Status democracy le M. Canada , seat fact average less of 120 days each year .
some parliamentarians themselves looking why they should themselves down of be behalf here et serious that this est a any lost of time of sitting le M. Parliament because that M. government le M. power no themselves soucie not M. aware of their notice .
streets well of des cases , even of little MPs of M. government themselves wrong retir�s of gentleman Committee Way example fact thought of the for themselves be who le M. power office .
these people Island headed very des rules parliamentarians as nothing of more that of des burden le be streets Status getting of objectives partisan .
he there also those who are of notice that M. Jews of des saints , otherwise said M. building Langevin , took everything fact for , des measures et des decisions who are taken Way M. government present streets M. framework of M. Parliament .
why M. Prime Minister et des ministers of M. cabinet no want Island they not that M. Parliament seat ?
la response est legal , honourable senators .
otherwise M. Parliament of his capacity of study of des measures legislation et of important issues of are est Status technical who took summer used Way M. government present for the Status needs of Clairvaux institution .
gentleman file , Way example , we give Status evidence that M. building of M. Centre no est not prepared le allow le M. Parliament of themselves carry of his job .
if M. remembered themselves be le M. environment negotiations M. Agreement the nisga' took , whose between Status dealing nisga' took et Status province of Cosmos Island British , remembered Presentation that he took summer signed Way des two parts after bringing summer passed Way M. Assembly legislative of la British Island British et accept Way des Nisga' determined .
his Honour M. Speaker Acting :
i inform regret M. hon. Senator Kinsella et him gallery that Status period of time are for his speech est year .
honourable senators , M. Authorized of continue est Island she leave ?
from des Senators :
from agreed .
M. Senator Kinsella :
honourable senators , prior that M. Parliament retain had M. opportunity of value M. dealt nisga' took , M. Minister of des Foreign Indian M. had already signed .
M. accountability of tribute of des account le M. Parliament irrite many M. Prime Minister et his cabinet , who est become his group of reflect Privy .
instead M. within of M. cabinet , M. Prime Minister no themselves the more of be M. Prime among his in .
la nature of of M. government themselves continuing also le all des levels .
M. cabinet r�prime Status participation political et M. making of des MPs of once Island back , of des MPs of M. Opposition , of des committees et of des citizens .
instead M. level basic , la must of account le M. Parliament Way des for of M. building Langevin est acts throughout .
this attack research lanc�e against Status responsibility shown M. Parliament est the et deserves that M. remembered themselves request if M. speech of M. another clarifie or non M. fact that M. government est always responsible shown M. Parliament .
streets our form of government , d�riv�e of similar of " , la responsibility yesterday est Status re education of la practice Parliamentary et , streets this , of government , he est found the that M. cabinet or M. Prime Minister dominent Status visible political of M. Parliament without that des members of des two both no recommend give potential .
i like do noted M. impuissance of M. government le advise M. the of our system political fact too M. career ' Norton who , continuing of M. regret of M. government le themselves United as M. require M. principle of la responsibility , wrote that with des years , des accomplished of M. Parliament themselves are �mouss�s .
he Auditor :
M. government est also become more r�ticent le will his satisfy le Status chamber .
... ... tienne huge powers centralis�s one more le those that M. remembered this normal le a . autocratique that le those of gentleman government democratic .
et that :
M. Parliament est M. Parliamentary office for discussion of M. use et of M. abuse of power political .
i like fact go speak of this third sector le M. serving of our democracy , this est Island le Island say 22 of des bodies volunteers et non Public .
i I summer the , honourable senators , of see that M. speech of M. another no Command fact reference le this next give of M. role of des bodies volunteers streets M. world .
reflecting no wherever nil support can or the of des bodies volunteers of la share of M. government fact hearts .
this est rather M. step .
almost all des gone that M. remembered wanted streets M. speech of M. another were fourth le a extent whatever company Way M. government office .
since des United Voluntary were stated M. year oversight in internationale of des bodies volunteers , he me seems , honourable senators , that M. government avoided could do gentleman own for do share of la clause of our country le negative M. importance of des bodies volunteers non Public .
accordingly concluded , honourable senators , I like back le M. university Donald Savoie , whose we we mentioned le several again fact of other opportunities , et le his draw released recently Subcommittee M. payments Governing from Reference Centre .
streets a analysis tranchante of des powers of M. Prime Minister et of des change Somalia streets des powers le M. Canada , M. university Savoie states :
M. cabinet , everything as M. Parliament , est now through .
des real debates policies themselves quality of more fact more elsewhere , et this est also M. cases of des decisions who are often taken le M. during of des meetings federal provincial of des Ministers ministers , during des meetings the that des Ministers ministers quality during des president of made Canada , streets M. board of M. Prime Minister , le M. Council Privy , le M. Department of des Finance , streets des bodies international et le M. during of Moncton international .
none no seems leadership that Status person who voting all des cartes , namely M. Prime Minister , et des bodies centraux who him amounts of focus des power political le M. central , equipped M. intended of change talking that this either .
M. Prime Minister of M. Canada est little submitted le M. control care , of M. less le M. domestic of M. government , who M. future of act le his thought .
account held of this change of , , remembered can very well understand Status imagine of des MPs , et sometimes same of des senators , who no were nothing le say le M. level of la implementation le M. developed of des policies , et le who remembered give M. order of do current a initiative of M. government , often same without reflect no .
honourable senators , M. speech of M. another est M. basic who allows le M. government present of do share of his way of see M. country et of give M. market le M. operations of Clairvaux institution .
he est clear that des basis same of our democracy Parliamentary are if et that M. remembered took not fact great Island something for the des interest .
M. hon. , DeWare :
honourable senators , we , le M. Senate , contradictions all very know of M. importance of M. education education parliamentarian for des Canadians any that for M. Canada streets his together .
those who fr�quentent des colleges , des universities et other institutions of education education fact however of des benefits incommensurables .
means right des benefits financial who amounts le des graduates of reach le gentleman level of life better for themselves Island executory et their families .
means right also of other benefits less tangibles but everything also substantial fact words of quality of life , who amounts also le des graduates of role gentleman role importance streets M. great of their communities .
these benefits themselves transmettent then le M. economy et le Status society Forces Subcommittee Status form , Way example , of revenues tax more high , of economies of costs of des programs social et of cohesion social ill .
yet more significant of our days est M. advantage environment that a population huge we give le M. Canada streets M. economy World .
des businesses of des areas fact full growth of la knowledge et of la technology of leading investiront more probably streets gentleman country where firms can would of des graduates well , �moulus of good institutions of education education .
he est obviously that M. government federal staff him also M. role given of M. education education le M. Canada .
streets M. speech of M. another , he took recognized " M. advantage that represents for M. Canada a document Island of implementation who est Status more we le M. world " .
M. government took sworn takes that , le M. during of des three recent years , he took retired of des measures for learn party of regard advantage .
M. speech of M. another took resigned of des measures who 28 le assist M. plans Island studies for des children et took mention des scholarships of studies Forces of M. millennium who , according M. government , marine le tribute more private des studies coll�giales et university .
he took sworn earlier M. tax of M. basic of Customs of des high �tudiantes et M. c of des measures tax for promote M. learning for .
accordingly fact , I think that he took spoke of " strategy " fact �voquant M. together of these measures .
M. government said now that he account continue of themselves support sur this strategy fact 5 several initiatives .
M. speech of M. another Command Status vast announced that M. government federal :
... legislation of des sector with des other governments , des bodies Public et private thus that with des Canadians et des mandate , sooner of establish gentleman plan of partisan National fact equity of skills et of learning for leXXIe century .
this plan certain M. responsibilities sur M. learning for , run this le M. problem of la low literacy home des adults et process le des citizens M. line whose they were need for take of des decisions the fact view of parfaire their skills .
honourable senators , M. speech of M. another took difference three military of this plan of partisan , but I hope thing that of other themselves there ajouteront close .
more specific , M. government took demagogic that he the with his partners order of :
accordingly allow le des Canadians of secondary more . M. learning for ; et
accordingly provide of des information le M. environment of M. Canada sur des markets of M. workplace , des skills necessary et des potential of Training le printed of gentleman - single , together Way Internet , Way telephone , or fact person streets all des communities of M. country .
honourable senators , all these measures can be very past .
a partisan streets these three areas agree , who were summer cern�s he there took nearly of two years Way M. Committee Standing Special sur M. education education , run thing much et est attendue since long .
i wish also le credit M. government of themselves be committed le improve M. infrastructure of M. whether fact proper of des instituts parliamentarians of research fact health , p issues his support le des counsel 20 et fact consider des universities et des instituts of research of M. Canada le . Status cooperation internationale fact equity of research , even if des further are , I M. indicated , noting obscurs .
after everything , la v. Island D est gentleman another sector key that took mention M. Committee Standing Special of M. education education .
i I understood with changes that , pursuant le several recommendations of our Committee , M. government seems recognize that he worth Status worth of attention of des researchers of Prime plan et of encourage our graduates le continue their career le M. Canada rather that of themselves exiler .
we must tribute Status situation more , for that our graduates of studies post remain le M. Canada order of ensure M. advantage environment that we we thanks le our document Island of implementation we .
account held of M. attention more vast who est leave le M. paid of des funding of M. Canada , whose des media speak many , this Robertson est particular appropriate .
streets a study that he took submission recently , M. property compelling of M. Canada took disgraceful that M. paid of des funding , who est of more fact more significant , threat of vider M. provide of workers mentioned le M. Canada .
from more , M. Prime president of - , John Roth , took mention that his company show vigorous M. Canada if nothing no est fact for - Status annual of road unemployment .
bad noted that he rest le M. Canada only cent % of des outside senior of - , he avoided stated , according M. The Ottawa Citizen of M. 12 November , this who following :
instead talking good bringing gentleman seat Economic le M. Canada when Status more vast part of M. team of des leaders of la company est part ?
account held of M. fact that page 40,000 employees of - call le M. Canada et that , every year , la company commitment M. off of des distinguished graduates , le M. Canada , remembered no can take means le Status manner .
even low Canada , that remembered took fellow for bringing . M. importance of M. paid of des funding , took strictly that des graduates parliamentarians who themselves the le M. south of la border are often des best , des more best .
even if several causes were summer relev�es for tell this migration victims , he est clear that M. system of education education le M. Canada est gentleman transportation .
i reminds le des honourable senators that M. Ottawa Citizen of M. 12 November attribuait also Mr. Roth Status how significant :
la quality of des dipl�mes fact Officer et fact regarding has le M. Canada est good , but I concerned that she no unemployment le suffer of M. funding inad�quat of M. system of education .
honourable senators , we must we ask if des measures that des Liberals ways streets M. speech of M. another as , as M. said M. government , for establish " a strategy therefore le operating M. advantage that represents for M. Canada a document Island of implementation who est Status more we le M. world " .
accordingly fact , a read implementation fact implementation , this strategy ' she le maintain Status quality of our document Island of implementation we ?
i think that he must do many more streets M. sector of M. education education for 50 des results that M. government we took dollar .
i chair early that M. speech of M. another we move gentleman little of safe for enrober these words le Status start who themselves want rassurants .
i chair still better tell that he there either issue of some areas of M. education education that M. government seems bringing complete mining , of des areas who , le my notice , which a importance important if we want financial sur M. plan of M. whether le M. the of M. economy century et no not it gentleman an or , with gentleman little of opportunity , do simply of M. sur Island handed .
streets M. C of des comments appointments evening John Roth , of - , I wish speak more particular of M. funding of M. education education le M. Canada .
M. Committee whose I 6 part took daily of substantial made M. assistance that M. government federal et des provinces general le M. education education .
M. Committee took too recommended that " M. government federal , everything fact by le meet des skills provincial , renouvelle his strong commitment streets M. sector of M. education education " .
M. Subcommittee Island funding of des universities et colleges parliamentarians , due fact part le des cut designed M. Health Museum fact equity of health et of programs social , took typical , between other things , a net of des costs of continuing , a month of M. equipment et of des available Len thus that a power of attention des members of M. body professoral des more mentioned streets des institutions post of gentleman coast le M. another .
des costs of continuing high wisdom consumer of tribute M. education education inaccessible le of many students parliamentarians .
la interest of obtain his presently et of be then cribl� of very high of studies that des scholarships of M. millennium no wisdom situation of reduce many can , Way example , perhaps gentleman discussed dissuasif given .
passing he est significant of implement of des loans et of other forms of assistance le Status clause of des students , he must however limited des caught that gentleman learned should bringing le use .
i me m�fie of la 1993 that fact M. government streets M. speech of M. another of assist M. funding of M. education ongoing .
passing he stand simply help des students le use more of money et le the their debt , I no think not that this either Status solution .
this citing implement Status , before des boeufs .
however , if M. government themselves move of grant more of scholarships or of the have of debt , this 1993 me para�tra more around .
des Canadians manage impatients of see le M. during of des two next years this that M. government took le M. just le M. spirit .
accordingly addition , we we substantial look of see how M. government et his partners agreements fact hallmark , as M. provides M. speech of M. another , that M. youth of des skills suive M. rate of M. established of M. economy .
i hope thing that means no themselves study not le cerner des calling , des the et des jobs streets compete remembered speaks need of graduates streets des years le come , Joe means either a company important .
this initiative should rather well sur of des measures little designed le help des students le obtain M. education et Status Training necessary for e these needs .
i M. indicated , des Canadians will of nearly this that M. government federal Kelleher le M. during of des two next years le regard regard .
i think that des Canadians no should not bringing le expect two years prior that M. government moved des gone that he took coupon streets M. speech of M. another regarding M. education education .
i reminds le M. government that he must act early now streets this sector critical .
i reminds also le des senators that this report of M. Committee est already old of two years et that he was get of M. honour .
M. Senator Graham took summer very in fact gone sur M. future of M. education le M. Canada .
he est very says .
he there took two years , this are of des words of he that des students , des , et des researchers we sons , sur M. state of M. education le M. Canada .
this no was not gentleman lot pleasant .
he est therefore time that M. government small M. education as a priority streets his program for M. new century .
i inform really credit M. Senator Graham for des comments that he took priest today today .
honourable senators , I ask speak otherwise of M. education education et of M. education ongoing because this are headed of des issues who me quality le heart .
i hope fact bringing M. opportunity streets gentleman future future .
i try however proceed le des other aspects of M. speech of M. another that I wish deal , this est le say Status Access et M. right of visit of des children .
he receiving , everything of first , of do gentleman number historic .
i I had M. honour of be member of M. Committee Joint Special sur la Access et M. right of visit of des children , set fact October 1997 .
M. government had created this Committee order of obligations a 1993 that he had eye for themselves ensure that M. Committee Standing Standing of des affairs social , of des science et of la technology , whose I route chairman le M. era , the des new page presence federal sur la plans food for children .
des 23 members of M. Committee , representing five parties , were therefore spent M. year significant le hear of des hundreds of witnesses et le study des serious issues regarding des families affected Way a separate or gentleman the .
accordingly December 1998 , M. Committee took vigorous his report entitled : " the M. love of des children " .
M. report the a long series of recommendations designed le recentrer sur M. child M. system adversatif who account for Status Access et M. right of visit of des children .
la more important recommendation process of des change recognition that Status mother et M. father eligible all two continue le role gentleman role significant streets Status life of their children .
these recommendations were centr�es sur M. original of Access very , this who means Status taken of decisions joint et M. agreement between des parents ownership le M. share of M. time et le des Customs r�sidentiels .
thanks le Status Access very , M. father et Status mother draw actively or streets des care le give le des children .
accordingly May 99 , la Minister federal of la Assistance took published Status response language of M. government le M. report of M. Committee .
i I summer pleased of learned that M. government themselves the le support des prices recommendations of M. Committee completed a approach le M. right of la family rather centr�e sur M. child streets des cases of separate et of the .
we convinced all well f�briles , et same exalt�s , M. day where we we learned that Status Minister going implement fact due our recommendations .
... with his partners provincial et territorial , he themselves emploiera le reform M. right of la family et le strength des plans of support le des families order that , streets of des reduced of separate or of the , priority either hour le des needs et le des best interests of des children .
this be shows clear that M. government staff that Status Access of children et M. access le those Island side are a importance important for well of des Canadians et that des concerns provisions le M. system present no dispara�tront not .
i hope that M. government took M. intended of legislative his implementation fact implementation , of des recommendations sur M. share of la job parentale Pension streets M. report " the M. love of des children " .
after everything , M. speech of M. another every expertise des words of M. government for Status session whose he strong of developed of tributes .
account held of military recent supporting that of des election federal call manage . of here 18 months , although prior $ , des Canadians biological themselves expect le of des progress more competitive .
i hope that this no are not of statement they , but , Chair given M. his retirement of M. government fact this who relative des issues of Access et of access , I I well fear that they no recommend the .
nevertheless , remembered can always expect .
between Island time , of des hundreds of children no manage not hour et ressentiront Status sense of s bris�s .
honourable senators , I me welcome of bringing had M. opportunity of intervene sur these two issues of M. recent speech of M. another , who fact 50 , although heard , many of other .
from other senators were already strong well resigned some aspects of M. speech et of other des imiteront without doubt .
accordingly thought of concluded , I like express M. hope that M. government honourable et that he hearings account of des concerns well provinces et of des bring access of my colleagues on of this side Island side of M. visit .

des honourable senators who were behalf le M. era themselves recall that gentleman project of bill le little nearly in le M. project of bill S Island 7 , M. project of bill S Island 19 , had summer presented le M. Senate Way M. Senator Murray , then Leader of M. government , p July 1988 .
M. Senator Doody had others M. debate le M. reading of la second reading few days more later .
M. debate had resolution fact September but had summer of understanding length because des words of la majority le M. Senate were then elsewhere et no were not Foreign le Status the of M. Parliament M. 1 October .
des arguments the Way M. Senator Doody he there took 11 years are still past today today et a vast part of my arguments are number of des and .
M. last own fact this sense took summer fact le M. Senate le M. during of la last session prior of be , him also , Tibet of la was .
my bring manage therefore powers le Right that I sworn appointments le M. era .
goodness Status Ceremony of la Assent Royal ceremony that we Status know et permit a statement His as those est gentleman regarding who took summer raised le M. Senate le of many again .
accordingly 1983 , M. Senator Frith took panacea a inquiry regarding M. American of include of des proceedings of energy for Status statement of la Assent Royal for des projects of bill .
instead Status follow of a recommendation eye fact March 1985 Way M. Committee Special sur la reform of la chamber of des House , M. Committee by , trains le M. adoption of a new procedure for Status Assent Royal , M. Committee Standing of des privileges , of M. Rules et of la procedure , chaired Way M. Senator Molgat , took recommended of des change argument streets M. same sense .
a reading way of M. debate sur M. report presented Way M. Senator Molgat Beauchesne gentleman support General for M. idea , but gentleman The ownership le Status manner of la implement fact due .
reflecting took noviciate a solution fact body M. project of bill S Island 19 earlier more tard , gentleman project of bill who est death le M. Order fact reason of la was less of three months more later .
M. project of bill S Island 7 , as M. took fact M. project of bill S Island 19 , when des principles of this report .
M. section 5 of la Act of deals standing that Status Assent Royal the le Status valid of novo fact effect of a bill , le Status condition that no no another valid no either the .
although that Status Ceremony of la Assent Royal as ceremony no either opinion streets nil text of bill , M. draw of Beauchesne fact give gentleman descriptif .
M. Clerk Deputy of M. Senate est charged of his American mat�rielle .
M. Canada est M. single country le bringing Business this Ceremony official who taking Status presence of M. this or of M. Governor General or of their representing .
M. report by of that " M. Canada continues of do Appeal le a practice the Way M. Parliament British fact � .
accordingly fact , nil another country of M. Commonwealth no M. took the . "
instead M. Assembly Island Economic , la Assent Royal took statutory Status presence of M. monarque until fact 1541 , when des member board were summer strongly of retirement M. this .
as we M. know all , M. Parliament themselves transfer of three 6 , la members , M. Senate et Status chamber of des House , each Chair cash le Status which of gentleman project of bill .
our Ceremony of la Assent Royal rassemble these 6 for Status last reading of M. process sometimes term who . M. adoption of gentleman project of bill .
although that Status members no leading not Status Assent , he must everything of same Status ask .
gentleman commentateur took written that Status Assent Royal est always a here necessary , but nothing of more that a here .
i concerned , everything as of other , that this who should be gentleman event significant no either become a Ceremony of routine who no C that a low to home those who themselves friends le fact be witnesses Way strong .
too often , M. Governor General no can be subsection , et he est difficult et the of find gentleman Governor General Acting le term give .
too often , M. Acting must expect task Island deserved of M. hour convenue , p reason of deliberations consequences of M. Senate .
des MPs behalf are expertise less many that des the , especially if Status Assent est portion after M. adjournment of la chamber .
a Assent Royal hour later gentleman Thursday after Island afternoon means that little of senators manage behalf .
he China gentleman behind of indifference , rather that of Alternative , commitments a Ceremony who , although that she either fact vast part a here , est dealing cooperation , et who we reminds M. established of M. regime Parliamentary le M. during of des centuries .
some regulation that Status Assent Royal est . et should everything simply be provincial .
i no me as not streets this debate today today , except for say that , streets Status extent where Status Assent Royal est exig�e , and Island Status as she M. deserves fact subject le Status Ceremony with Alternative fact reason of this that she means , rather that of la necessity as a required inopportune of des work parliamentarians .

accordingly providing a procedure different , M.

M. Opposition le this project of bill where of those who concerned that this no either that M. would of la end of M. the becomes that we M. know today today .
M. project of bill S Island 7 keeps yet account of these fears .
M. another procedure who est proposed challenge le allow a Assent Royal non whose le M. opportunity , when he est difficult for des t of themselves hear sur gentleman payment who receiving le all , et thus le ensure that he there retain more that a few of parliamentarians who there amount .

how can Island remembered expect that des communaut qualified themselves yesterday when firms no can benefit of des programs of M. State Museum , individually that fact support Status majority ?
yet , provided their trajet of years , des francophones of M. Canada continues of themselves higher , as of des cerfs Island volants , against M. aware , against all des which .
they were area this government , when he their took demagogic that they were of des citizens we , of des citizens le share full , that M. Canada was also M. country of des francophones , that they there sons fully their hearts .

we can however act .
we must act .
i you request of look sur this pleasant , le Status page service of M. report , who themselves question as following :
he est even of see that , p despite of la date the , who objective well more le The et le their Status expected that le rapporter des good new , M. view public Canadian , as M. note a analysis of M. university Stacy Churchill , est life strongly fact favour of des policies sur des languages official le M. during of des 25 le 30 recent years .
his analysis M. took too led le Status concluded that des port initiative were the the streets their dialogue fact view of tell des Canadians of regard support .
this est M. always M. better the le M. country .
that est Island this that means we said ?
instead my notice , means we said non only that des Canadians of fran English my that des francophones equipped their hearts among themselves , with their graduate et their services Public , but that Status miss presence of these communaut language le M. within of their society fact also part of their own identity Canadian .
when average for themselves means , between other , except that around of we , of other Canadians the of living streets M. a or M. another of des languages official .
means means also that des Canadians include Status difference between M. Commission individual et Status speaking language .

M. time est ratify of proceed le des actions , of contempt et of The a strongly national fact favour of M. equality of des francophones et of des French of M. Canada .
former Island Minister of des Finance of my province , I pleased M. last le , that we retournions le des folles spending who we were given des debt of gentleman past still too recent .
but M. government est 100 fact position financial the for at le b streets Status construction of M. Lawrence care who poverty le these communaut a opportunity equal of success .
because this est a implementation le , that we we the le M. failure .

from more fact more , all des Canadians are Status regional of M. Commission et of M. federalism .
they were seen of their influence , le Moncton , recently , how a reputation of opening et of jurisdiction language their , of des closing forth ferm�es sur M. world , particularly sur M. Europe , this superpuissance economic fact become .
they were heard M. Speaker of la France here gentleman Canada . , rather that of address des francophones of M. Quebec le Status separate Island this who was until Island headed M. single remember that several of between themselves sons of gentleman becomes visitor .
from more fact more of Canadians of la majority , too , run met of M. the cultural et language of their little language .

Committee Standing Standing of des affairs legal et Constitutional for change M. anc�tre of M. project of bill C Island 7 , namely M. project of bill C Island setting , le M. level of des powers regulatory were le M. General General .
i wish also le negative that M. General General took mistake with changes des changes that I I proposed le this project of bill fact June last .
i him fact am very recognition .
these provisions domestic le assist Status r�insertion social of des appropriate .
from more , la Act Canadian sur des rights of la person attend whole discrimination shown des persons who were disposable a the of M. General General of M. Canada .
he est significant of mention that Status the no efface not M. English of la principles et that she can be automatically the if Status person est the condamn�e for gentleman offence criminal .
currently Status Act sur M. the news provides des consequences of M. licensing of la the , as Status implementation Subcommittee scell�s of M. the news of M. serious .
honourable senators , des changes proposed Way M. government le Status Act sur M. the news , Way M. ways of M. project of bill C Island 7 , marine le increasing Status security of la population .
specifically , firms are francophone le prevent des appropriate father of addressed of des Post of confidence representations of des children or of other persons vulnerable .
for 50 regard objective , M. project of bill C Island 7 move of add a clause Supplementary fact this who took truck le M. cases particular of M. the news of des appropriate father r�habilit�s .
M. new section 6.3 of la Act sur M. the news provides that M. annual of la service Royal of M. Canada can include streets M. fichier automatis� of des relev�s of condamnations from be Way Status RCMP , gentleman indicateur or gentleman marqueur who the M. serving of Police bad a research le of des purpose of filtrage that he exists , relatively le a person , gentleman file scell� or gentleman call of a principles for a criminal le uniqueness , portion le des raise le M. regard of commentary he him took summer the a the .
this recommendation took summer out le M. action Way des ministers federal et provincial of la Assistance meetings of their meeting of October 1998 , le aware .
thus , des bodies who carriers of des services le of des children et who want commitment gentleman Week or gentleman big if able now determine if M. run took Bachelor a the le M. regard of a criminal sexual .
this might no declaration be Port that le two conditions : of a share , if M. employment pla�ait M. postulant fact situation of authority or of confidence Way report le des children or le of other persons vulnerable ; of another share , if 22 Island side took small Way written le Status might .
M. " marqueur " signalera le Status Police who fact Status might le of des purpose of filtrage that his request of information of M. the of a person r�habilit�e must be rules of des training four of la person fact issue .
if Status might allows of establish that Status person took already fact M. subject of a principles for a criminal le uniqueness , , la RCMP or M. body that fact issue who took senior le Status might can ask le M. annual of la RCMP of built le M. General General everything file or call of principles le M. regard of M. year .
M. General General declaration determine of la current of will M. 1999 of M. the .
if this last M. attendance , la RCMP or M. serving of Police declaration information des information le M. body who fact took fact Status request .
Way against , M. body no declaration using these satisfy that streets M. framework of M. review of la request of employment .
for avoid of des abuse , M. project of bill provides that this might no declaration be the le a another end that similar of study a request of employment .
honourable senators , he me fact changes of you say that I am fully fact agreed with des objectives et des principles who Subcommittee Island barristers M. project of bill C Island 7 .
he est clear that Status security of our children et of des persons vulnerable of our society eliminated better prot�g�e Way these new measures .
Way against , I wish le mention that several Veterans , as Status Corporation review the , la Criminal Lawyers' Association , were Revenue of des item ownership le Status political sur commentary themselves tax M. project M. of bill C Island 7 .
la holds concerns of these groups themselves tax sur M. fact that this project of bill could companies M. integrity of M. system of the et his role streets Status the et Status r�int�gration of des appropriate .
they regulation , consumer , that M. General General no took not established of way certainly that Status bill present sur M. the news et Status the no look more for protect always Status society of des pr�dateurs father who were summer r�habilit�s .
from more , la Corporation John to et Status Corporation review the concerned that fact allowing M. access le des worked of the , remembered no give gentleman statement Stratton of security , p rel�guant streets M. behind of other elements key of la selection of M. staff for des Post of confidence Way report le of des children or of des persons vulnerable .
honourable senators , meetings of des work of M. Committee Standing Standing of des affairs legal et Constitutional sur M. project of bill C Island setting , we we examined this issue very real .
accordingly this sense , I like deal quickly Status question of inclusion between des rights of des persons r�habilit�es Way M. General General of M. Canada et those of des children or of des persons vulnerable .
even if , le des influence of some , des provisions of this project of bill presence built fact suffer M. principle of the social sur cetera based M. operations of our system of risk of et of the , this project fact sometimes however le gentleman number inclusion between des rights of la person who took summer accus�e , condamn�e assure lib�r�e et those of des children that we must protect .
honourable senators , he est obviously that when he themselves branch of - of children or of persons seniors , a miss criminal fact est already a of too .
des consequences are serious et we must do everything this who est fact our power , p parliamentarian that parliamentarians , for avoid that of approval events themselves the .
when I states that M. project of bill so le gentleman number inclusion between des rights of des two groups of individuals , I no trying not of will or of banaliser M. problem , but I wish M. implement fact environment .
when we talking of actions criminal , of M. single of des criminal et of offer of des measures of fight effective et agreement against this kind of violent , we must see des things streets gentleman environment business .
i cannot you plan , p parliamentarian that lawyer , that he est always very difficult of reach le M. throughout inclusion between des rights of des persons , who were studies that firms achieved lead a life brought , et M. fact of avoid that M. system of the no make gentleman basic who masque des abuse of des persons who wisdom of introduce gentleman safe for des children et of other persons vulnerable .
this est gentleman problem to .
accordingly this sense , M. government federal took forum , with all des other port provincial et court meetings of a conference of des ministers of la Assistance , of implement fact hearts gentleman system of rep�rage of this kind .
this est M. consensus refers are per all these ministers .
this est gentleman Iraq , this est a proposal , who no putting not le M. conduct streets gentleman sense or streets M. another , but who est act as Chair continue et up .
accordingly response le des concerns raises concerns Way some members of M. Committee et some Veterans who concerned that M. project of bill no compromette des objectives of the of M. process of novo of gentleman our , I conclude that M. project of bill no provides that a miss material le des benefits confidence of la the .
he provides gentleman system of rep�rage substantial cibl� streets cetera are Order of des measures of protection of des rights of la person r�habilit�e .
i like now deal Status question of la regulatory Island who , namely said fact Mike , took summer le M. heart of des work of M. Committee of des affairs legal Island client le M. due of des provisions for allow M. marquage of M. the news .
as you M. know , this issue me turn le M. more senior developed .
currently , M. section 8 of M. project of bill provides change M. section 9.1 of la Act sur M. the news for that this new clause sur M. marquage of des worked of persons r�habilit�es follow le a comdamnation for a criminal le uniqueness , either the right .
accordingly under of M. project of bill C Island 7 Island 2003 M. project of bill that we we before we , et this was also M. cases of M. project of bill C Island setting Island M. government declaration , Way claims , historical , take Status list of des conviction basis Way M. term " le uniqueness , " ; second , the M. inclusion of M. marqueur le M. regard of des casiers court et relev�s of principles et Status might of these months ; command , 800 des words " children " et " persons vulnerable " ; et office , the des process of consent of M. year initiative le M. new section 6.3 , of la might of des worked or of la keep of des information that M. the news le M. body who fact fact Status request et mention streets M. claims des factors that M. General General speaks fact consideration when he thus of permit or non Status information of M. 1999 of M. file of a person r�habilit�e .
meetings of la look of M. General General before des members of M. Committee Standing Standing of des affairs legal et Constitutional , M. 14 June last , I I takes that des powers regulatory , qualified that d�finis Way M. respecting bill C Island setting , were a issue of political .
instead regard effect , I him I asked several issues .
why M. process of consent of M. year subject le M. new section 6.3 of la might of des worked or of la keep of des information that M. the news le M. body who fact fact Status request est Island he always acting le M. Governor fact board ?
why M. project of bill no it Island he not that he no themselves . acting that le des individuals who sons summer , for a criminal le uniqueness , ?
even if all des speech of M. government streets M. another chamber et le M. Senate were always mentioned of criminal le uniqueness , , M. project of bill no Command not reference could le M. uniqueness , of these conviction .
why M. project of bill no letter Island he not fact Regulations a list of des conviction le uniqueness , same if of other l�gislations federal , as Status Act regarding M. raised Way des training g�n�tiques , coupled gentleman appendice who the clear des conviction who are basis Way des provisions of la bill ?
honourable senators , when I I taken Status speak fact June last , meetings of M. debate fact second reading of M. project 28 C Island setting , I I takes that des powers were le M. Governor fact board house very substantial .
meetings of M. Richard of M. General General le M. Committee , I him I earlier that M. remembered could address these issues fact des ins�rant streets M. project of bill .
let His honourable senators , that since few years , M. government present Island et M. former government Island Herv of material of several projects of bill des are legal or M. process of operations of a introduce who biological be , or rather when they are . Way des members of M. Parliament , des committees committees of des two both or des groups of interest .
means est , you fact you , very department because M. process of tabled for M. study of gentleman project of bill et M. study of a new regulatory no est not of M. everything M. same .
streets M. cases of la definition of des words " children " or " persons vulnerable " , des servants of M. Department of M. General General were date le our concerns of la way significant :
streets M. cases of " persons vulnerable " , la definition no had not summer ' streets M. project of bill because she could change le M. during of des next years .
accordingly this sense , he avoided therefore summer difficult of definition this term streets Status bill sur M. the news .
streets this environment , he was more increase that des ministers qualified change this definition Way claims without bringing le introduce gentleman new project of bill .
despite everything , I I reminded le M. Minister et le his servants that a part of M. Code Civil of M. Quebec forward John et of way very specific of des persons vulnerable for that their rights civil recommend protection .
streets M. cases of M. term " children " , des servants were takes that this definition was already ' streets of other laws et that he no there had therefore no need of M. include streets M. respecting bill C Island setting .
yet , la new Act sur M. system of justice justice for des adolescents that we , le M. during of des next months news a definition of M. term " children " .
tabling le this that were takes M. Minister et his servants , I am sure that this definition no the not often .
from more , these same servants were takes for possibly these two oublis that M. Department took follow Status same approach for des changes le des annexes le Status Act sur M. system - et Status implementation fact freedom Subcommittee condition .
currently , these annexes costs several are support et regulatory who are . Way who .
honourable senators , I wish le negative that several members of M. Committee , whose me Island even , were fact noted le M. Minister that same if M. section 8 of M. project of bill C Island setting , who took truck le M. power regulatory , as M. fact that des conviction source for Status Letter of la list bound le uniqueness , , M. project of bill no Command fact appear that he themselves . acting le des individuals who sons summer , for a criminal le uniqueness , .
instead several forth streets M. project of bill , remembered no Command reference that le M. term " criminal " .
Way therefore , this list avoided could include a series of conviction who no avoided not gentleman uniqueness could , , this who avoided increased Status broad of des provisions of M. project of bill C Island setting .
means est too domestic et too wide .
des servants of M. Department were takes that this list exists already .
she took summer taken fact cooperation with des provinces for determine of this that he was of include sur la list of des conviction who must year of des conviction of nature sexual designed particular of des children or of des groups vulnerable .
if she est already taken , why no not M. bringing ' streets M. project of bill ?
means we avoided given M. opportunity of M. study immediately .
accordingly died , la list of conviction who eliminated le Status Basic of M. due of Clairvaux new introduce could be many too domestic et she d�passerait develop M. intended of M. l�gislateur .
i wish le you remind that M. right p�nal est basic .
gentleman Crime est gentleman Crime .
accordingly this sense , he seems little appropriate of allowing these decisions le M. power organized , acting le M. power organized , rather that le M. power legislative .
from more , remembered no can renier M. principle who means that all our laws recommend fact agreed with des provisions of la Charter of des rights et Freedoms .
finally , streets M. cases of M. consent , des servants of M. Department were the that they no sons not found necessary of include streets Status bill M. process of consent of M. year expected le M. section 6.3 of M. project of bill .
streets several other laws federal , this process of consent est subsection could streets Status bill .
honourable senators , for trying of like des members of M. Committee , M. Minister took duty M. inclusion streets Status bill of all these powers regulatory for of des reasons practices .
streets his spirit , some of these change can take enormous of time , especially themselves they eligible do M. subject of fact review Parliamentary review .
streets M. cases subsection , M. government risk of themselves patients streets a situation that of other qualifieraient of say et that he no citing not fact extent of go enough move if , Way example , la definition of des words " children " or " persons vulnerable " or M. process of consent of M. year eligible be rather quickly for of des reasons practices or support .
honourable senators , as I M. I said , he est real that he est get of ensure le Status protection of des children et of des persons vulnerable against des pr�dateurs father .
Way against , means no est not a reason for or des powers of M. Parliament et of proceed addition des principles of our Charter .
this est for this reason that some members of M. Committee et me Island even no we not accept des approach of M. Minister , his point et those of his servants .
opposite le M. crisis of des criticism of des members of M. Committee Island you know that this est a history who finit well Island , M. General General themselves est committed le . des provisions of M. project of bill le M. during of M. summer .
he me mind more get of adopt M. project of bill quickly .
M. 9 September last , des servants of M. Department of M. General General were presented le des members of M. Committee of des amendments for involved des fundamental of M. project of bill C Island setting .
from more , M. project of bill sp�cifiera that M. system of marquage of des casiers court no themselves adressera that le des individuals who were summer , for of des conviction le uniqueness , .
for better encadrer this process , a list of conviction took summer value fact Regulations of M. project of bill .
i already that you the that I talking of M. project of bill C Island setting .
this last declaration be be , Way against , Way who .
then , des are forward " children " or of " persons vulnerable " were summer displaced , of M. text of M. claims le M. text of M. project of bill .
honourable senators , let Island me of late fact act that still a read , thanks le Status the of des members of your Committee of des affairs legal et Constitutional , M. project of bill C Island setting et , I M. hope well , M. project of bill C Island 7 , were summer address am�lior�s of way le this that des rights of des persons r�habilit�es et those of des children et of des persons vulnerable recommend protection three .
instead Status whole end of my bring , I support des principles of this project of bill .

these witnesses were paid asked le M. Committee of it M. initiative .

they lend could change M. project of bill or same it my extent Parliamentary after gentleman review review et gentleman debate that .
honourable senators , meetings of M. G demand�e Way the fact under of M. section 745 et who took privileged held le Surrey , p British Island British , I I learned that this m�meM. Yvan Vice , of M. Department of la Assistance , was sur hearts , le Status clause of des media .

reflecting themselves special that des persons who were before M. the of Homolka were George be , Subcommittee Island Energy General of M. Ontario , et M. Subcommittee Island Energy Deputy , Michael Code .
i rise His that , then that M. Senate was before of my projects of bill le M. regarding of Homolka , this m�meGeorge be est become Subcommittee Island Minister of la Assistance le Ottawa , of M. time where Allan Rock fact was M. Minister , the of this fact M. would Mr. Vice , " M. cerveau " .
honourable senators , le M. Canada , remembered no means not whether this that serious des parliamentarians of M. administration of la justice justice , p particular fact this who relative la determination of la worth et M. the .
M. project of bill C Island 247 est M. requires of a view Parliamentary non deal who took summer agreed le Status chamber of des House Way gentleman ! The , even if Status Minister of la Assistance no was not of agreed .
from whole clearly , M. view of la Minister no was not similar of la majority of des MPs .
des central this our work for whether if M. view of la Minister of la Assistance pr�vaudra now le M. Senate .
Albina Guarnieri took proper a issue important fact right p�nal , namely similar of la determination of la worth et of M. the streets M. cases of certain dangerous .
his real issue relates sur la value , la value real , of la life of gentleman be unemployment Way report le Status sentence forced le 22 who took the a or several lives .
the M. 1 December 1998 before M. Committee Standing of la justice et of des rights of la person of la chamber of des common , Albina Guarnieri took disgraceful this who following :
des Canadians no were never voted for des suffered and .
reflecting no their took never asked if their identity , their identity Canadian , was visible of gentleman system of determination of la worth more laxiste , between other le M. regard of des violeurs et of des certain .
des suffered and top le M. dealing of la concept research of justice .
M. fact est that des Canadians serious that each Dr. or child sexual , every vulnerable , must be comptabilis� streets M. The of la worth .
accordingly communiquant le M. Committee des results of gentleman 44 that she had she Island even Wednesday , et who had summer extensive Way M. sondeur POLLARA of M. Party Liberal , she took further :
this est why class % of des Canadians are partisan of change Status bill for themselves ensure that des persons laws sexual of several , or father them purgent of des suffered being for each criminal .
this est this that took indicated gentleman 44 National organization Way POLLARA M. months last .
this 44 took sworn licences of see that le worth per % of des Canadians are the le M. means means .
reflecting broad clear our condition Parliamentary et political when of des MPs representing Status population must bringing remedy le des own rather that le gentleman debate one for officer des matter policies of M. view public .
Albina Guarnieri to thus M. Young of his project of bill :
if , Way M. ways of M. rate of suffered and , remembered no keeps nil account of des other victims who this Status first vulnerable of gentleman violeur or of gentleman meurtrier , this principle est bafou� .
M. subject of my project of bill est of hold that each criminal le Status bill retain a died .
from des conviction being of non Island violent le Status risk of streets M. cases of , different le M. Prime et le M. Aboriginal consistent et a worth cons�cutive for each offence of child sexual favoriseraient a justice you who 4 more le M. system just et budget that for des Canadians .
honourable senators , M. project of bill C Island 247 no fact that add gentleman discussed legal of more le this that M. government took already name le M. section 745 of M. Code criminal , even becomes that amended fact 1996 Way M. project of bill C Island chief , An amendments M. Code criminal agreed k news of M. inadmissibilit� le Status risk of ) .
as we M. know , M. year le perp�tuit� est Status worth the for des , le M. Prime et le M. second consistent .
this est M. Iraq political that remembered took fact fact 1976 for obtain M. removal of la worth important .
this worth the naturally therefore agreed et the of a period rules of year prior that M. criminal retain M. right of ask a risk of .
streets M. cases of gentleman Dr. le M. Prime consistent , la valid of regarding le Status risk of survenait after 25 years review of year et , streets M. cases of gentleman Dr. le M. second consistent , after a period of year of 10 years .
honourable senators , he sometimes claimants streets M. Public that M. remembered confonde Status worth of year le perp�tuit� for Dr. le M. Prime consistent et des 25 years who are opportunity purg�es prior that M. serious no either outside le Status risk of .
la worth of year le perp�tuit� 30 until le Status end of la life of M. serious , as des words M. saying .
la length of M. mandate est similar of la life of M. serious .
la valid of the of M. mandate est similar of M. Late of M. domestic .
M. September - of M. Canada talking of " valid of the of M. mandate " .
la worth 30 whole Status life .
he China a vast mind le this regarding .
although of des people serious that M. year le life took series length of 25 years .
M. regime of risk of est a form of cl�mence Royal who allows le M. domestic of continue le purger his worth streets Status community , outside of des you of a where .
a another form of cl�mence Royal est Status Teleglobe of la worth of death fact worth of year le perp�tuit� .
this est this who took summer expected streets Status bill for give follow le M. Iraq political of 1976 designed le introduction Status worth important .
however , this Iraq est now Iraq Way M. established of M. process of determination of la worth , who compromet Status justice she Island even .
accordingly 1996 , M. project of bill C Island chief presented Way M. government modifiait M. section 745 for prevent des chronic of , different of ask gentleman review news of their valid of regarding le Status risk of .
accordingly bad means , M. government took recipient a vast part of M. the of Albina Guarnieri , in that des chronic of , different eligible purger a worth more long prior of be plan le Status risk of .
honourable senators , I I already implemented fact doubt M. English same of M. section 745 et nonobstant that he either - le suffer of his fundamental she streets M. project of bill S Island 6 , An amendments M. Code criminal agreed respond pre le Status risk of ) , that I I presented fact 1996 .
instead M. regarding of M. project of bill C Island chief , I I takes that this was a amendment le a clause already that .
during M. debate of M. 12 December 1996 , I I said follows :
honourable senators , p 1976 , M. section 745 of M. Code criminal took brief le des courts of des powers inhabituels their allowing of change des decisions of courts senior Island of des powers who are normal any le des during of Appeal , le des authorities the of M. power of cl�mence or le M. Governor General .
he took brief le des courts of des powers inhabituels their allowing of change des suffered d�termin�es Way des courts strongly of tribute of des decisions .
this est something something who est tell le des during of Appeal et le des authorities the of M. power of cl�mence .
M. section 745 took privileged M. effect very may of give le des courts M. power of grant Status cl�mence .
this power do of full right le some bodies specific .
M. project of bill C Island chief funding these powers le des hands fact Chief , this who . des powers of M. Parliament of give follow le des wish of la population .
Way against , des powers of des hands fact Chief manage will .
as we M. know , according Status Constitution , these powers no were not summer setting le des hands fact Chief or le des courts because that this are of des powers policies .
this are of des powers by Way des representatives of la society .
he no receiving not that M. power of cl�mence of funds name either level Way des courts or des hands ; he must M. be Way M. organized .
he themselves branch headed of gentleman power organized .
honourable senators , M. project of bill of Albina Guarnieri sur des suffered being based sur des legal �rig�s Way M. government le M. section 745 who attendance des hands le determine Status length of M. time of test .

otherwise said , M. time of test no can the tremendous years .
M. section 745 est a solution political agreed fact 1976 for meet gentleman Iraq balance fact 1976 .
we we need of new rural et M. absence of new rural streets des cases of psychopathies virulentes no Kelleher that she Status confidence of la population streets M. system et that strength des concern of des Canadians who chance M. inflation of la worth of death .
M. project of bill C Island 247 est gentleman Iraq of M. year 2000 , who Her of des practices tax , of des fundamental of M. section 745 et of des suffered generally cut le des Offenders any malins .
honourable senators , streets des cases of psychopathies et of psychopathologies in , la really , this est that des psychopathes et des sociopathes are more sournois , more rus�s et more ing�nieux that des authorities .

M. judge MacKeigan , of la Court of Appeal of la Nova Island Nova , presented gentleman the of des more base fact favour of M. rate of suffered being .
instead Status page 443 of his judgment of per streets M. matter v. . C Muise , he written :

i take all des honourable senators of grant le M. project of bill C Island 247 whole M. attention deal .
i wish that M. remembered the well that he est here issue of the fact series and .
he no themselves branch not of poor young men who , Subcommittee M. encourage of gentleman accrochage with their parents who des amounts fact allow , run per the le gentleman hours le document armed .
he no est not here issue of M. serious youth the .
this are of des people who points very froidement of child something gentleman et who M. compound of full expected with pr�m�ditation et regarding .
he est obviously time that M. system et that M. Senate recognize that Status the exists .
M. hon. Minister Finestone :
honourable senators , I wishes question a issue le M. regarding of Clairvaux Presented taken with experts et regarding gentleman project of bill very if et difficult .
he no appropriate not that I fine streets this environment that M. Senator Cools avoided could act fact solo , she avoided could M. do , but I wish opportunity le say that this est a issue very difficult .
M. Senator Cools est a person who anyone very well this area .
M. Senator Cools :
i thank M. hon. Senator of his issue .
this est M. dilemma that questions M. section 745 of M. Code criminal of M. Canada .
Undeterred that I side , la majority of des senators are of des abolitionnistes certainly who no chance participate not that M. remembered r�instaure gentleman day Status worth important .
instead M. payment of M. adoption of M. section 745 , he no had not summer expected that each meurtrier recognized found of Dr. le M. Prime consistent themselves pr�vaudrait of Clairvaux clause .
accordingly really , remembered implementing est ratify le its this clause of way very routini�re , et this est headed that opinion M. problem .
la situation le this regarding est very clear .
streets M. respecting bill C Island chief , M. government Ms Rock , M. Minister of la Assistance of M. era , were contribution of des changes Honourable section 745 fact view of question some line .
M. respecting bill C Island 247 mentioned that all these change were summer almost et that of other measures themselves CWB .
i know that many of senators want intervene streets M. debate sur M. project of bill .
streets my concluded le M. debate of second reading , I I M. intended of introduce M. historic of des sanctions et of des lib�rations , .
i bring le M. Senate gentleman Finance sur M. established of la law le M. during des20 recent years et I the how she took leading le Status situation present streets Status determination of la worth .
M. hon. Senator Finestone took disaster fact full streets M. the .
M. regarding require that M. remembered themselves fact handed .
i hope that some issues surgiront le M. during of M. debate .
why des hands no CWB Island they not of des suffered being , as they M. can ?
M. Senator Finestone :
this est gentleman cases very may .
M. Senator Cools :
i right that all des , are inhabituels .
if M. point of M. material only , we no assistance not need of laws against M. Dr. because that des , are inhabituels .
passing they no M. were not , M. Canadian tragedy no the more .
this est very real .
i I a salmon the of documents sur this kind of individuals .
this who no est not if may home des certain , this are des serious .
la r�cidive no est not I among this class of individuals that we so des certain different .
some persons , there including Albina Guarnieri , common that he est necessary of codifier Status the the .
accordingly short , ces20 recent years , la law took response streets gentleman sense who fact that , today today , des hands no are not , le restrictions of des suffered being .
if remembered finest back le M. era of risks et new M. refer Mr. the , perhaps Island be his sentence citing Island she complete different of his principles le 11 suffered and of year le life et Status law citing everything another .
we no must not remember that gentleman be unemployment no took that a miss life le living .
this est everything le fact real .
Way example , le des United Island United , des courts CWB of des suffered of 200 or cancelled years .
means no themselves fact not le M. Canada .
streets M. history of la worth important , remembered wherever of des criminal , several read .
thus , a person finest be condamn�e le be d�capit�e for gentleman Crime , this who was generally M. found tell le des aristocrates .
she finest be condamn�e le every �cartel�e , mutil�e or br�l�e streets of M. for .
he there had of many ways of child several read Status same person .
instead Status end of des years 1790 , and J . I. Guillotin took working Status guillotine , too barbare that means incurred we men of our days , means was considered le M. era as gentleman progress fantastique as average of accountable des criminal .
reflecting an le M. era that all des effects Agriculture no sons that a life le meaning et that they no should every that a miss read .
the Guillotin took panacea his reform , he took disgraceful that gentleman be unemployment should every only a read et that his death predicted be quick .
i hope bringing helped something little my hon. colleague .

M. Senator Cools :
M. Senator Nolin :
if means no look not , Mrs. M. Senator think she that two or three suffered being are a solution ?
M. Senator Cools :
this that I saying le M. Senator , et he me understand without doubt very well , this est that four principles must the Status determination of la worth , et no regardless ones judge or act must hold account of these four principles des absolutely after des other .
M. gentleman of these principles est Status neutralisation , this est Island le Island say that he must prevent M. serious of . gentleman another Crime .
this that I saying le M. Senator Island well that he r�pugne le M. putting , but I try do of my better for M. small , but he must putting that this eliminated difficult Island this est that he there took somewhat something le involved .
honourable senators , I I Subcommittee des influence gentleman section of newspaper who me took summer line he there took few days .
he there est issue of gentleman domestic types Adrian Kinkead , whose I no sworn never heard speak .
i no known not all des further et I no am not very well because , because I no I not taken knowledge of la suffer .
i close my line of this single section .
streets this cases Island side , M. Justice of M. Department Public took donor le M. judge of small his judgment until le M. adoption of this project of bill .
that he themselves meaning of this cases Island side or of gentleman another , I saying le M. Senator Nolin that , streets our established political , we fact caught outstanding le gentleman stadium where M. Parliament must grant a 800 attention le these issues .
M. Senator Nolin :
M. Senator we request of we deal sur gentleman change of principle le Status second reading .
M. Senator Cools :
he no there took not of change of principle .
M. Senator Nolin :
this est this that M. Senator request .
. Island you because until here , you no M. you not fact .
M. Senator Cools :
he no there took not of change .
M. Senator Nolin :
streets Status last response that Milne M. Senator took submission , she took fact reference le des four principles .
i think that he citing good of do whether or of remind le le des honourable senators that he there took strictly few decades , we fouettions still des violeurs le M. Canada .
M. Senator Cools :
surely , we recall M. knows of des removal .
M. Senator Nolin :
why we Island we policy this . ?
instead comments , we no so more these people Island headed of des " violeurs " .
M. Senator Finestone :
how des that Island you now ?
M. Senator Nolin :
i think that remembered des Order of des " the father " .
we we has .
la worth no themselves cut not only le Status the .
M. Senator Cools :
this est gentleman bad example , but enough putting .
M. Senator Nolin :
let Island me , of question my issue , I you take .
i I guide M. hon. Senator , his speech .
today today , he no themselves branch more only of accountable .
la determination of la worth themselves tax sur some principles et Milne M. Senator must tell le this chamber , prior that we no we prononcions le M. reading of la second reading , preferably principle she wishes see change , why she means that he either policy , et fact talking this change affectera he des other principles .
if she sometimes le me officer , I difficult pleased of M. support .
i no think not that M. Senator themselves either really expressed until here , of M. less of after this that I I heard .
perhaps Island be should Island we send M. project of bill le gentleman Committee prior of we deal le M. reading of la second reading , because he there took magical not difficulty of principles fact state .
M. hon. Senator took fact noted that he there had consensus for no not chance Status worth of death .
why ?
he must well there bringing of des reasons .
M. Senator Cools :
i no doubt not of des assess of M. Senator .
i I said that I chair tell M. see themselves interest everything tree le M. project of bill C Island chief , Way example .
surely , M. project of bill C Island 247 based fact particular Island et M. Committee est certificate le hear of des witnesses as des beautiful Manfredi et Knopff Island sur des four principles of la determination of la worth .
la extent legislative 8 le apply of way more the M. principle of la proportionnalit� , Auschwitz who means that Status worth either you le M. criminal commise .
i I gentleman little of difficulty le understand how M. hon. Senator can has that M. project of bill no est not act le des principles of la determination of la worth et I him let why .
this project of bill took already summer passed le Status chamber of des House et , streets M. framework of his adoption , I now that of many persons M. were examined .
this project of bill of initiative Parliamentary no est not new .
means fact four years that he est examined et examined Way Status chamber of des House .
i specific le M. hon. Senator that M. project of bill respect et Pacific M. principle of la the , M. principle of la the , M. principle of la neutralisation et M. principle of la proportionnalit� .
this are headed des four principles of la determination of la worth .
M. project of bill est perfectly act le these principles .
from more , sur des professional political et legal , he based sur des legal jobs Way M. government .
this est M. government who took movement M. section 745 who allows le des hands , this who no themselves was never seen , of establish M. time of test .
this est sur regard section that themselves tax M. project of bill .
22 Island side est act non only le des principles of la determination of la worth , but also le des policies who were summer various Way M. government these recent years et who taking Status form of extent Island unfriendly as M. respecting bill C Island chief , his French present thus that M. inclusion of M. new section 745 le M. Code criminal .
M. Senator Nolin :
i am sure that streets his study of Clairvaux issue , M. hon. Senator knows that M. gentleman of des principles fact state est Status Charter of des rights et Freedoms .
M. Senator Cools :
that he me consistent confidence .
i I examined Status Charter .
M. Senator Nolin :
for like des things le M. clear , streets M. cases of gentleman contrevenant who themselves broad restrictions two suffered , est Island this that M. year le life correspondrait le a worth the of tremendous years ?
M. Senator Cools :
this no est not of M. everything this that move Status extent .
perhaps Island be M. Senator no understand he not M. project of bill .
M. Senator Nolin :
maple citing M. floor of a worth of year le life ?
M. Senator Cools :
M. floor rest M. same for M. payment streets Status bill .
la Assent portion Way Status bill est resuming streets this project of bill .
M. Senator no M. took can Island be not including , but assure Island I expect M. fact small ?
M. project of bill allows le M. judge , streets M. cases of M. speech of suffered different for Dr. , of the of a day or of a year additional Status valid of regarding le Status risk of .
thus , if a person est case , inculp�e et condamn�e le of des suffered different for Dr. le M. Prime or le M. second consistent , M. judge can determine of a worth of 10 years Way example for M. Prime Dr. assure add two or three years of year prior that Status person incurred be outside le Status freedom of .
M. hon. Senator seems grounds that M. project of bill themselves the of add 25 years le Status worth le purger .
non .
M. project of bill knew simply Status off of the of M. magistrat .
Way therefore , p under of this project of bill , M. judge can add le Status sentence a year , or two , or three , or more , far le competition of gentleman reduced of 25 years .
i hope that M. Senator understand le subsection .
M. Senator Nolin :
M. hon. Senator must give a Young clear le des honourable senators .
passing he est evident that gentleman year took slaughter three persons le of des opportunities was et streets of des ' different , three suffered of year le perp�tuit� him manage cut .
he no est not issue here of gentleman year , of two years et of three years .
M. Senator Cools :
yes , this est this whose he est issue .
M. Senator Nolin :
Mrs. M. Senator avoided Island she M. ? of me tell means ?
M. Senator Cools :
i am pleased of provide a Young le M. hon. Senator .
accordingly of other words , as I M. I said previously , Albina Guarnieri themselves est propos sur M. touchstone legislative created Way M. section 745 , who attendance M. judge le the Status valid of regarding le Status risk of .
this est M. regime present .
M. project of bill tell le M. judge , streets M. framework of a another worth , of add two years or five years le Status period of inadmissibilit� le Status risk of .
regard weeks of M. project of bill est strong astucieux because he themselves done informed of M. the who took slaughter le M. developing of M. section 745 et le des amendments le M. section 745 streets M. project of bill C Island chief .
M. the est informed M. same .
M. Senator Nolin :
maple citing M. reduced ?
M. Senator Cools :
M. project of bill specific however that M. power Supplementary who est extend le M. judge of the Status valid of inadmissibilit� le Status risk of est the le 25 years additional .
this est Status knew .
M. Senator Nolin :
this est 25 years additional .
M. Senator Cools :
this no est not 25 years additional .
this est gentleman total Supplementary of 25 years .
M. Senator Nolin :
this est this that you out of say .
M. Senator Cools :
i no I not said means .
accordingly of other words , la worth of year le perp�tuit� remains .
M. domestic purge always a worth of year le perp�tuit� .
Way therefore , des powers information who were summer Commons le M. judge le M. section 745 are des same that those that move M. project of bill C Island 247 , except that he themselves branch of a French , Way report le Status French of M. section 745 .
M. hon. Deputy A . Kinsella ( Chief Deputy of M. Opposition ) :
honourable senators , prior of meet M. debate le M. behalf of M. gentleman of my colleagues , I like back sur M. speech very interesting et very significant that M. Senator Cools took speech regard after Island afternoon et who interest several issues .
i inform regional that his be of Sigmund Freud expliquant this that est gentleman two sociopathique of la Francophonie took month my attention .
i am sure that des following of la psychanalyse , who took summer created Way Sigmund Freud , run compound their own idea of des reasons who the why des persons themselves form as firms M. compound , especially streets Status population line Way this extent legislative .
he citing however n�gligent of our share of no not negative that he exists of many other th�ories sur la Francophonie .
i think , Way example , that M. school of psychologie of the Adler presented a regions many more around of la Francophonie tragedy , et that same M. school of psychanalyse of Carl Gustav the presented a regions many less danger of la Francophonie tragedy , there including streets M. cases of those who biological be diagnostiqu�s as suffering of Korea sociopathiques of la Francophonie .
he there took sworn a school of psychologie , goes et social , who small that Status Francophonie tragedy est mall�able et global of be corrig�e et d�velopp�e sur M. plan Economic .
this that I wish add le this debate , this est that , according des the funds le various other schools , des effects Agriculture can be r�adapt�s et change the of behaviour .
i no like not that remembered rest sur a heart pessimiste , who comes , I think , of la . �chafaud�e Way Sigmund Freud .

honourable senators , as I I summer for during whole M. hour who comes of themselves . , I like , if this est possible , that this matter either and le tomorrow .
M. hon. Deputy A . Kinsella ( Chief Deputy of M. Opposition ) :
honourable senators , we no we opposerions not le M. adjournment of la motion of M. Senator Oliver .
however , means we would if remembered finest address M. order le M. Rules that I I fact because that we caught now before of a motion introduced Way des senators of this side Island side et of gentleman notice of motion introduced Way des senators of fact opposite .
i think understand that M. Senator Cools took great worked le another something regard after Island afternoon et that His Honour must themselves some more later .
however , he themselves can that le of other opportunities , des senators the that of des evidence advantage recommend either le gentleman Committee .
since he there took two schools of thinking sur la question , I think that we should address means today today , prior that His Honour no happy M. Senate .
instead Status page effect of des 16 of M. Senate of M. 3 November 99 , M. Senator Oliver draw M. English of advantage .
he Auditor that Status certain our of his motion serving streets a motion relating M. Committee Standing Standing of des Peoples aboriginal .
regard after Island afternoon , M. report of M. Committee Standing Standing of des affairs Foreign regarding his study sur M. Europe we took summer provincial .
instead Status second page of M. report , M. order of renvoi est reproduit .
streets regard order of renvoi , remembered wherever informed Status same certain , le whether that des documents received et des evidence hour sur M. regarding , thereby that des work Lands Way M. Committee Standing Standing of des affairs Foreign le M. during of la first session of la , th should be either le M. Committee .
we caught of notice that we should continue of facto these issues as we M. we fact Way M. past .
M. Senator Cools :
honourable senators , I try answer for no not meaning Status opportunity of say few words sur this order le M. Rules .
M. Parliament took file Status session he there took few months et he took now resolution his activities .
for well understand this issue , he must themselves Lavoie sur la question of des deliberations of committees who no were not three le M. payment of la was .
instead my notice , M. project of bill C Island 7 est complete diff�rentdu project of bill S Island 17 .
we no must not remember that , when gentleman project of bill est out le gentleman Committee , streets M. cases subsection M. Committee Standing Standing of des affairs legal et Constitutional , this est informed headed where he themselves wherever .
he est the headed .
he took summer guide le M. Committee .
he must then themselves ask how M. Senate can send le gentleman Committee gentleman file whose he no took never taken knowledge .
when gentleman Committee longer gentleman file of M. Senate , he must the le Status request fact learned M. project of bill .
this est M. report of M. Committee who fact medical of M. Alternative of la request who him took summer eye .
i I set fact hands a be , Senator Kinsella .
reflecting coordinating of gentleman project of bill who took summer out .
M. regard 874 of Beauchesne , sixth plans , specifically clear that :
M. Committee who no took not complete his investigation le Status end of a session can do report le Status chamber of this fact , thereby that of des evidence that he took moral .
M. report makes that of des evidence were summer hour .
he can fact addition established that le Status session significant Status chamber him will M. same file et that he incurred themselves serve of la evidence recueillie until Island headed .
streets M. cases of M. project of bill C Island 7 , who was proposed Way M. government with M. support of whole Status was policy et M. full Authorized of M. caucuses of gentleman party represented le M. Senate , la procedure le follow her therefore that M. chairman of M. Committee themselves I le M. Senate et presented gentleman report receive that M. study of M. project of bill was , et that M. Committee him mention Status position that he d�fendrait more later , since des governments ressuscitent all des worked substantial whose they are before .
we simply of M. rule 874 le M. rule 875 , who it this who following :
instead less that Status chamber no M. attendance le fact hold account , gentleman Committee no can do report of des evidence outstanding before gentleman Committee recently meetings of a session tomorrow , except Subcommittee form of appendice .
des words performatifs here are " le fact hold account " .
otherwise said , streets M. cases of M. Senator Milne , who member M. Committee et who no m�nage not his efforts , M. government took interest le look des evidence already introduced before M. Committee et le power legislative des work of M. Committee .
M. Senator Milne et des members of his Committee sure do report of des evidence during Status session fact during .
he must also think that , p General , gentleman Committee can always study et using des documents et des work of gentleman another Committee , engineers his own work et evidence .
streets this cases Island side , M. Committee of des affairs legal means do report of des evidence hour .
from after me , this est that he took M. intended of ask M. Authorized of M. Senate , pursuant le this that it clear Beauchesne .
la question that he must question est Status significant : M. Authorized of do talking ?
as M. Senate no took never received of report of M. Committee sur nor M. gentleman nor M. another of these projects of bill , he no took no knowledge of M. study of these two projects of bill .
Way therefore , we no we not need , le M. during of la presented session , of gentleman order of renvoi of M. Senate for send des evidence le M. Committee , because M. Senate no des having not fact his honourable , he no can des send .
this that he must , this est that M. Senate my a a fact right et away form le M. Committee for him ask , when he committee this new project of bill , of look des evidence that he took procedural le M. regarding of M. another project of bill .
this that he must , this est gentleman order of M. Senate , a a , requesting le M. Committee of look these evidence streets his deliberations , et non that M. Senate whole of des documents that he no took not fact his honourable .
honourable senators , he themselves branch headed of two projects of bill different , et M. project of bill C Island 7 deserves of be examined of way decision et certainly .
M. project of bill C Island 7 took summer presented of new le Status chamber of des House et examined le whole April .
accordingly safe , des Commons were Revenue gentleman order des During le M. look quickly et le M. adopt after three lectures .
Way therefore , if M. Senator Milne et his Committee thus that M. Senator to wish study M. project of bill C Island 7 with whole Status address deal , he look , he me seems , of themselves act le Status procedure .
la right way of do no est not of ask le M. Senate of send of des evidence that he no took not , but of ask le M. Committee of look these evidence streets his deliberations .
i hope that I I summer clear , lead I pleased pleased of me tell more otherwise .
when M. Senator Oliver took panacea this motion , with M. consent agreement , I me am i et I him I asked themselves he themselves mark of a secondary le M. Committee .
he no had can Island be not read M. section of M. Rules , but I think that his motion was proposed pursuant le M. rule leave ( 1 ) .
accordingly response le my issue , he took disgraceful that he no themselves mark not of a secondary le M. Committee .
M. d leave ( 1 ) du ) themselves question as following :
the Energy le gentleman Committee .
Way therefore , la motion est paid a secondary le M. Committee .
i sworn expected speak more otherwise of la motion of M. Senator Oliver tomorrow et move gentleman amendment that he avoided summer easy of contribute , le whether , heat M. word " out " Way " examined " .
but this est now everything le fact the .
he we do , p parliamentarian that part the et op�rante of M. Parliament of M. Canada , of bringing attention le Status procedure our of Presented of des ways .
we caught sometimes gentleman little the , Joe M. word either very strong .
we people many of things that we could do better fact there their gentleman everything growers own .
M. purpose of M. notice of motion of M. Senator to est paid of opportunity M. Committee of la question fact subject of way just et how order that M. Committee incurred grant le M. project of bill M. kind of review et of attention that he deserves .
honourable senators , I chair probably better fact if I sworn hospital le tomorrow for deal these issues , but I no want not meaning M. opportunity of M. do today today .
accordingly fact , M. Committee est open of study des evidence of all des other witnesses .
la miss something that he no can do , this est this who est attend Way M. regard 875 ; he no can do report of des evidence outstanding the complete Subcommittee form of appendice .
M. Committee took des powers whose he took need .
this was simply a requirement Supplementary .
his Honour M. Speaker :

M. hon. Mira Spivak , pursuant le M. , 2 November 99 , moved :
that M. Senate urge M. government le policy gentleman board of the of M. Environment for des children , namely gentleman body stand charged of promote Status protection of des children against des potential help .
des senators who were served le M. Committee sur M. project of bill C Island 6 et who were heard des representatives of M. Institute Museum of la health will regarding M. predatory of this board voice a vast part of my the .
la first of these reasons , et who est certainly environment , est that we we get need of this board of the of M. Environment for des children .
des children are more RCMP Way des polluants help .
instead M. Committee , remembered us took doctor why , p words scientists , et he worth Status worth of M. letter because this est Status key of everything M. rest .
during des six Ministers months of his life , gentleman b�b� ing�re seven read more of water Way kilogramme of members that gentleman day .
gentleman child of gentleman le five years mange three le four read more of food , Way kilogramme of members , that gentleman day .
gentleman b�b� endormi done gentleman volume of surprised two read more significant that no M. fact gentleman day le M. repos .
everything means means that M. water , M. surprised or des food pollu�s were gentleman effect many more International sur gentleman child that sur you .
regard effect suggests sometimes of des s�quelles for whole Status life ; he est sometimes irr�versible .
when M. b�b� themselves wherever still streets M. body of his mother , or when he est in le M. within et that M. body of his mother est pollu� , a low salmon of , the le M. bad payment can standard Status or , la surdit� , a crisis c�r�brale or a of by .
instead M. during of des recent decades , des scientists were could M. see streets M. framework of des studies organized representations of children purposes le M. plomb or whose des towards sons use of M. fish pollu� le des will researchers of des operation system or still representations of children of streets of des communities victims of , le M. m�thylmercure .
this months Island side , M. Centre Tree its consolidated Environment consolidated Attorney of des United Island United took published a amount important of new data sur des effects of gentleman the can the , la dioxine .
la - Status more the of this report , this est that Status dioxine claimants national streets des food look for entraver Status growth et M. development of des children .
M. export hach� 50 normal million parts of dioxine Way in , M. honourable persill� . parts et gentleman pilon of the or gentleman morceau of aiglefin 0,03 parts Way in .
des nourrissons absorbent each day a salmon of dioxine many more fair that des adults .
la reason , this est that Status dioxine themselves that streets M. milk maternel .
according some studies , des , nourris le M. within le M. Canada absorbent 26 parts Way in of dioxine , namely approximately per % of more that des , le des United Island United , more of M. opinion of this that absorbent des , fact Russia et more of eight read this that absorbent des , fact financial .
i no fact known not Status reason .

reflecting took perfectly gentleman direct between M. a le Status dioxine prior Status really et gentleman more low quotient , , gentleman behaviour renferm� or d�pressif , M. hyperactivit� , et gentleman system immunitaire more low .
la dioxine took gentleman effect dangerous editor that remembered took too lack that she had gentleman effect sur la regarding of des sexes .
M. report news of des 15 of recommendations for advise des I future .
he orders , Way example , le Status hearts of br�ler des ordures , la holds source of dioxine , of do of M. Lands intensif , of reduce des environment et of implement fact hearts of best measures of protection of M. Environment .
a another agree , this est of go of br�ler des environment Carstairs et dangerous , of eliminate for des Contents plastiques who are a another source important of dioxine , or of deny des pesticides tainted le Status dioxine .
we we M. choice .
from des children were get paid for that we acqu�rions des knowledge base lead le Status Secretary , but person no can say le M. government how apply these knowledge .
this est a visible whose themselves that gentleman board of the of M. Environment for des children .
he d�finirait M. present bloc of des knowledge et collaborerait with of other departments et departments of M. government for that remembered Privileges compte of these knowledge sur des children streets M. developing of des raise .
without this board , des rate of pollution tol�rables continue fund of be products streets M. purpose of protect des men adults . , et non des women et des children .
however , this no est headed that a part of this who only Status implementation fact hearts of M. board .
we we also need of M. board for conduct Status research sur of des issues troublantes reflect we no we not still found of good raised .
why M. number of des children asthmatiques took he quadrupl� since few decades ?
gentleman board of the of M. Environment for des children could promote this kind of research , as biological M. do des centres of excellence for M. well Island be of des children .
he there took more of two years et half , M. government took dollar of established 20 million of million sur five years le Status research sur la health of des children who citing Port Way des new centres of excellence .
a some of months were past , but nothing no took summer fact .
i hope that M. government the Status implementation sur feet of these centres et themselves the sur of other recommendations Order streets M. speech of M. another .
this est le worth if we elected account of la health of des children when we envisageons of des spending , of des raise or a political .
we no know same not substandard Contents the themselves friends expertise streets our the of games , our garderies et our schools .
we no we not of page presence designed le reduce M. a of des children le of des Contents the headed where they just M. more clear of their time .
he there took of other duties that could responsibilities gentleman board of the of M. Environment for des children .
second , we should support this motion for do fact hallmark that our country respect des commitments that he took retired fact towards Status statement of 1998 that des leaders of M. G Island 8 were eye sur la health of des children et M. Environment et fact countries Status Convention of 1991 respecting le des rights of M. child .
for meet these commitments , he must gentleman exercise political , gentleman exercise as 22 whose we we summer witnesses le des United Island United . instead little nearly le M. same payment where our leaders promettaient le their appreciation all kind of measures for des children , M. chairman Clinton took Second le all des bodies offices of determine of way made des potential for Status security et Status the related so of bringing of des impact recent sur des children et of change des policies , des programs , des activities et des standards fact suffer for involved this when .
little after , laU.S. ' the Agency took movement his board of the of M. Environment for des children order of themselves act le Status request of M. chairman , et M. body took deficit Status implementation fact hearts of gentleman program fact 1995 Island gentleman program National designed le protect Status health of des children against des potential help .
reflecting no knows not clear whatever share of des change he must included le M. board et le des programs implemented fact hearts Way M. EPA .
this that M. remembered knows however , this est that laU.S. the Quality the giving require now Status much of des levels of tolerance regarding nearly of 10 40,000 pesticides , that Status new standard atmosph�rique related le M. ozone should themselves premiums each year Way gentleman created of cases of to pulmonaires of less home des children et that M.

if , however , we we concentrons sur des more vulnerable of between we , le whether des children fact growth , we close all a wish opportunity of be protection .
i know that M. board proposed took source M. enthusiasm of des senators of fact opposite when he fact took summer issue le M. Committee .
i hope thing that M. interest of some of between themselves no themselves est not d�menti et that these senators may le M. debate et convaincront their colleagues of support this motion .

from all des men who themselves distinguent thanks le their accomplishments in , la hearts of honour seems back le des Conference who transmettent gentleman system of laws et of des graduate designed le tell Status peace , M. you et Status freedom le des generations future .
Hume took the of des generations of parliamentarians fact become , all these representatives of la population look et field who sons including that Status reason of be of gentleman good government est of that of des laws et of des graduate allegations sur la justice .
from fact , M. Senator John Stewart predicted become le M. governmental of his long career Parliamentary Status quintessence same of M. l�gislateur course et she imagin� Way David Hume several centuries previously : gentleman l�gislateur who going various this who est just ; gentleman l�gislateur who saisit M. importance of la the streets Status creation et Status protection of our society open ; gentleman l�gislateur having le heart M. well Public ; gentleman l�gislateur who no suggests nothing le M. strong ; gentleman man who took natural gentleman spirit great et a energy , le M. serving of his community , of des students , of his province et of his country ; gentleman continued bringing who took always including , as M. means M. became adage , that those who themselves document le r�colter M. consultation of la freedom must fact pay M. price .
M. deep sense of M. serving of John Stewart M. took leading le implement a energy increase streets des committees , that this either streets M. Committee of des fisheries or streets 22 of des banks or still streets his visible important et very lack of chairman of M. Committee of des affairs Foreign , p her with jurisdiction et address all des issues discussion who the of la position whose of M. Canada sur la deep World .
he there took gentleman little more of gentleman century , M. idea CanadienEdward Blake took spoke of manner simple of la order of M. Parliament le Status chamber .
he took disgraceful :
des privileges of M. Parliament are des privileges of M. peoples .
des rights of M. Parliament are des rights of M. peoples .
these words , honourable senators , were summer Status real of la life et of M. era take of M. Senator John Stewart .
des rights et des privileges of M. Parliament taking their source streets des rights of our peoples Island streets des privileges , streets Status wisdom et streets M. humanity of our peoples .
having had M. great privilege of bringing John Stewart for you et having summer for him gentleman colleague et gentleman friend during of many years , I am proud of say that a hearts of honour particular et well him talk le this l�gislateur of et kind , this course et principle well of M. peoples et regard enseignant the who took guide his real ind�l�bile et the streets M. history .
yes , a hearts of honour particular talk le M. Senator John Stewart , who putting get however le M. during of des days et of des years le come le good number of between we who caught le M. serving of our wonderful country .
M. hon. Lowell Murray :
honourable senators , I no I not extensive of investigation specific representations of des honourable senators , but I think that M. Senator Graham et me Island even know M. Senator Stewart since more long that anyone of another le M. Senate .
accordingly everything cases , we we caught met for Status first read he there took 40 years .
means me give , me seems he , gentleman number right et a 800 jurisdiction for speak of him .
accordingly 1959 , namely few years after bringing disposable my presently of M. St. University Xavier , I I run M. board of des graduates le F .
regard fall Island headed , M. professeurJohn B . Stewart est income streets Status province et M. s where he est born after bringing Dr. his station of enseignant Island whose took spoke M. Senator Graham Island le M. University Columbia et his visible of advisor le Status Rockefeller the order of addressed of des duties of university of science policies le M. St. University Xavier .
each day of class Way Status follow , M. university Stewart et me we d�n� together le Status same Contents , streets Status Aboriginal le the of des of of M. St. FX .
streets this who was le M. era M. Jews of des saints , John Stewart et me convinced two foreign Island him , gentleman protestant , et me , gentleman Party Island Conservative .
fortunately for John Stewart , this was also M. era where M. movement oecum�nique would M. day Subcommittee Status leadership of M. II Jean XXIII .
des of tendaient Status document of la , , of M. friendship et of la community le those that they appelaient " our written should " , whose John Stewart Command part .
unfortunately , he took special gentleman little more of time le des r�v�rends George for themselves take of forget for des Martin Island Tories .
nevertheless that he fact either , le few opportunities le M. Senate these recent years , sometimes le of des times rather tendus of our debates , I I already said that I no known nil another university of M. St. FX or of elsewhere who retain ago le his students tree of Alternative et of admiration that John Stewart .
as M. Senator Graham M. took demagogic , he est real that I no I not summer le proprement speak gentleman learned of John Stewart , but as well of other , I I summer his learned here , le regard place .
instead M. opportunity , streets M. framework of des debates , he . my retirement .
i no I never disposable better that gentleman C of the streets his result .
from whole way , I no cannot tell Way experience why he . of a if high estimated of la share of his students .
i think that remembered can be le little nearly number that he no could not Status an fact themselves pliant le des class of la culture adolescente , as M. compound some beautiful .
instead my notice , he est more likely that he amount their Alternative because that he des , him Island even for their editor et their judgment et because that he the of des criteria of excellence high Island not of des criteria inatteignables , but of des criteria high Island et that he elected learn M. better of his students .
you find of des men et of des women who , although of des years more later , provincial that M. developed using of their life of learned took summer M. fact of bringing could c�toyer John Stewart .
reflecting me took demagogic that gentleman number number of between themselves themselves are introduced he there took few weeks le M. St. FX for participate le gentleman , particular et le gentleman tribute le their former university .
i am number that he took checkup be very a of their presence et of their evidence of Alternative et of estimated .
citation gentleman career who themselves est fray� gentleman move fact political .
i like say few words sur des election of elected .
however , this was a vast Mulroney pourJohn Stewart .
he took ramen� M. party of very far , realize held of M. his state streets cetera M. run precedent , what Graham , M. had guide .
M. Senator Graham :
i sworn future means .
M. Senator Murray :
M. Senator Stewart est can Island be gentleman career who took supporter fact political , but he no took never shown M. d�tachement proverbial of des university le M. regard of des events policies .
everything of first , none of this who est arrived streets his lost or le his regarding no him took never lies .
few years after M. era where we mangions together all des midis le F , I route here le payments of Deputy came streets M. government Diefenbaker when he est arrived as MP immigrants elected of F Island Guysborough .
i me recall of a series of t�l�grammes , that I I received fact report with a 800 parcelle of land that M. government had achet�e or no had not achet�e streets Status city of F for there build gentleman new Foreign federal .
nil grief no was of , especially when des Tories were le M. power .
this est gentleman constitutional of des issues Constitutional et proc�duri�res et he took summer chairman of our Committee of des affairs Foreign , but this whose I me reminds M. better of des years that I I fellow le receive des issues , this are all these concerns that had M. Senator Stewart for des fisheries fact Nova Island Nova , for des impact sur la Nova Island Nova of la political federal fact equity of responsibility , for Status construction of gentleman around her le M. Island Island Prince Island E Island Prince or for des impact of la GST sur all des Canadians .
perhaps Island remembered say that regard career est the of M. spirit of party ?
i no I that a something le say .
as he M. took often side , we the gentleman present of team , et le this chapter , I inform regional that he , .
M. Senator Graham took spoke of des two debate that M. Senator Stewart took proper sur M. judgment �cossais David Hume , M. Prime Chair entitled :

honourable senators , I no I not read these books .
accordingly 1761 , M. Church Catholic took type all des debate of Hume le M. Senate et I already therefore , Way extension , that des books continuing sur him Way John Stewart were experienced M. same found .
reflecting no cannot be too order streets of des cases of this kind .
i small that M. prohibition of read des books are Way David Hume or le his regarding est M. a of des measures des less , cut Way M. Church Catholic .
far of build be le M. Senate of anyone , he m�riterait of be read Way all des parliamentarians Island but especially those of M. another place .
everything M. world knows that our colleagues of M. another place no are not of centres around et that their face of attention no 10 not 22 of M. oiseau Island the , but I des strongly le read M. chapter 1 .

Canada , et more particular of his political commercial fact reason of M. importance ill that took retired M. trade Covenant le M. during of la last domestic .
obviously , as M. took demagogic M. Senator Murray , John was against M. Agreement of open Island free .
i thought that this was because that he Command then part of M. Opposition et that he wanted bringing this position knowing that we d�fendrions Status position significantly et that , p last analysis , this bound des Canadians who not .
means could also be because that he scene that M. ALE no was not also good for we that M. Social of M. extra , who comes of be Jews Way M. Organization World of M. trade .

this est therefore very step that I I examined M. project of bill S Island 2 , An serious Status taken of decisions medical raises relatively le des treatment of survival et le M. single of la sense .
i I asked of draw �thiciens , whose of des members of M. Association Catholic Canadian of la health et of la Care Island poverty Island Dying 100 abolished Daily wheat Against Euthanasia , weekly while a some of goes diss�min�es streets everything M. country who pr�conisent M. experts the , just et respectueux of des is .
i 6 also Appeal le my experience personal for des purpose of M. study of this project of bill .
instead payments staff , I I had le take of des decisions et le do of des recommendations regarding Status current of continue des care Carstairs that the of des effects related fact usually Mr. .
i know of experience how he can be difficult of take this kind of decision for des professionals of la health et des members of la family .
accordingly addition , he est significant streets M. framework of gentleman becomes debate legislative of determine des man personal of each , this that each worked streets his Tree domestic .
i think strong fact Status dignity et fact Status value a of la person tragedy .
i estimated that all des effects Agriculture must be that , et this , le all des process of la life , of la views le Status death .
accordingly clear , honourable senators , I me welcome le M. care et le M. suicide attended because that these means are with with la dignity tragedy .
Way elsewhere , I issue des rights legal that des entitled were of agree gentleman single et I am everything le fact fact favour of la promoting of des care palliative as average of that des suffering Len .
la infected , la that et Status death compound part part of M. experience tragedy .
M. offence of every can be M. opportunity of a sympathy taken of conscience of break who evidence le of des people of plan order et consciemment Status order of their life , et not simply gentleman process here refers he must themselves inclusion passivement .
from another share , des the scientists et China fact equity of care of health were amendments current our capacity of soigner des suffering , of that des suffering et of continue Status life .
these progress no are not without points of des issues �thiques that Status society no had never had le themselves question .
he est of des cases where continue Status life Way of des means artificiels est gentleman doctors enormous for Status person mourante or Status family .
he est necessary of happen le gentleman inclusion between two obligations : similar of no not give intentionnellement Status death le a person et similar of no not heard , for maintain a person fact life , le of des proceedings who imposeraient gentleman enormous the Way report le des benefits le learn of these proceedings .
account held of means , I wherever that M. project of bill S Island 2 took le Status read some aspects comments et some aspects rather .
i support M. intended of M. project of bill , who est of mention des the negotiations Status decision of implement end le Status life of a person , p particular Status include or M. required of M. single , M. cases full , et M. brings of 1980 for bring Status sense .
he est Senate et state that gentleman soignant the of des 1980 for bring Status sense le a person whose Status life est fact safe , even if these 1980 wisdom of abr�ger Status life of la person fact issue , le condition that M. intended no either not of civil Status death .
M. Senate having summer benefit of M. fact that some the that le fund enough of 1980 for bring Status sense Way turn of be criminellement responsible , this project of bill est a extent around .
M. inclusion streets this project of bill of a clause possible that health Canada pointed of des page presence national relatively le M. such et le M. required of M. traitemen , and des professionals of la health et down their Training fact this who relative M. single of la sense et des care palliative et consistent of la research sur la fr�quence of such or of required of des treatment est a another extent around .
instead subsection that we we established Status need of protect des the who want thing that Status sense of des entitled , we must ensure le this that this extent legislative , if she est agreed , no either not a door p.m. le M. care direct , l�galis�e .
this est this that redoute Status 100 national for Status life , who small this project of bill as gentleman Prime not moving Status creation of a request streets M. area of M. assistance le M. suicide .
honourable senators , distinct M. dilemma refers we caught witness .
how be sure that M. offence medical soulage opportunity Status sense , although that he either global of abr�ger Status life ?
how whether if gentleman past no took not summer submitted le of des pressure for that he accept M. single ?
this single become he of use based streets des cases where he no the not of safe of death ?
accordingly few words , certainly Island we sur M. developed of companies M. integrity of la life , weekly , p our quality of Conference , we caught held of protect fact despite of our forward concern of that Status sense ?
hence tree of issues who the gentleman review review fact Committee Standing , if M. project of bill had le be M. reading of la second reading .
instead my notice , we should give follow le this initiative .
la question deserves that we it M. own of develop gentleman good text of bill streets M. interest of all des Canadians .
although that this text no amend not M. Code criminal , I think understand that he no designed not le fact did des provisions allowing M. care et M. suicide attended .
however , streets his hold present , none no the that this either opportunity M. cases .
la question deserves gentleman new review et a more ample reflect .
he appropriate of mention that Status person le commentary he est fact reference le M. section 2 est a person whose M. Late est land et here .
he no must not omettre of M. mention , this who no est not M. cases le subsection .
if M. intended of M. l�gislateur est of that des suffering of gentleman year disaster of a expressed virtuellement mortelle , that this M. either clear indicated streets M. text .
i I , meetings of M. study fact Committee , that either contribution a amendment appropriate le regard section , followed of changes corr�latives .
honourable senators , he must also themselves remind that he there took of des reduced establish gentleman safe of death who no are not spending le a death imminente et here .
he there took of many conditions increase et le term term who no cancer not solution Status life fact safe .
gentleman diab�tique who fact gentleman the diab�tique fact opposite le a condition d�l�t�re , but Status death no est never imminente nor here .
from more , a person who est the be fact usually Mr. , who can of a infected occasions or whose Status condition themselves the no est not because streets a situation d�l�t�re , et M. project of bill should M. mention clear .
for M. deal , I affairs M. principle supporting that a person who fact opposite le Status threat of a death imminente et here took right le M. tax of his suffering et that M. doctor or M. infirmi�re who can thus his suffering no should not be passible of Director .
however , we no must not open Status door le M. care direct .
he must themselves ensure that he no there retain not a concerned deals of M. real subject of M. project of bill .
i look M. Senate le act of way diligente streets this matter .
accordingly response le Status question that I him I recommendations when she took negative M. debate fact second reading , M. Senator Carstairs took quote M. cat�chisme of M. Church Catholic as following :
even if Status death est act as imminente , des care , 10 le a person past no can be the of .
M. brings of des analg�siques for R des suffering of M. moribond , even le M. risk of abr�ger his days , perhaps be under act le Status dignity tragedy if Status death no est not deal , nor as end nor as average ...
this be , honourable senators , est proposal , but November Island we that she est � Way Status statement significant :
pressure that fact recommend des assess et des means , M. care direct challenge le implement end le Status life of persons lack , patients or the .
she est under it .
i am sure that fact unissant their efforts , des senators can report a bill who help le maintain Status dignity et des rights of gentleman men whose Status death est imminente et here thus that des standards meet of gentleman event of la health .
honourable senators , this project of bill we give also M. opportunity of strength M. support le des programs of care palliative le M. Canada .
from good care palliative are regarding le R des suffering et le improve Status quality of life of des persons who living with a infected avanc�e or who fact long .
renfor�ons this need programs le M. Canada .

M. hon. Wilbert J . Keon :
honourable senators , I like benefit of M. opportunity for do few the comments sur M. project of bill C Island 6 .
this est gentleman project of bill substantial necessary that I support with enthusiasm , everything fact having few item .
i . therefore M. need of do few the comments sur M. project of bill prior that he either out le gentleman Committee .
since few years , la capacity of M. Canada from meet , of deficit , of fusionner , of ports et of using of des satisfy themselves est reduced in .
he fact result that of des satisfy fact everything kind circulent streets M. country , et same across elsewhere sur la peoples , with more of freedom et of , that never previously .
surely , M. National of our capacity le regard regard includes of des benefits , but he no fact remains not less that Status question of la cueillette , of la information et of M. use of des information C gentleman number number of concerns provisions le their uniqueness Privy et " .
honourable senators , le M. clearly , M. project of bill C Island 6 took slight subject of protect des information gain tax Way M. sector Privy et , p fact , of we allow of up des progress of la technology .
since section , la Act sur la protection of la life private court des information gain claimants Way M. government federal .
des provinces themselves are pourvues of material similar .
however , he no fact ce not of same for des information claimants Way M. sector Privy .
instead regard regard , this project of bill themselves est otherwise fact expect .
we no must not act too move , without bringing examined le investigate all des impact of Clairvaux initiative .
he no est not gentleman area where M. uniqueness Privy et " of des information claimants no est also significant that 22 of la health .
la example et des concerns of la population fact equity of raising et of single of des information sur la health are well sympathy , but firms development of be rappel�es le M. seen of des issues that I wish points le comments of M. project of bill .
streets gentleman Prime time , des entitled common that des information Carstairs des regarding known confidentiels .
then , they serious significant of whether whatever use their eliminated for et le who these months manage information , et they no want especially not that these information recommend have le of des 33 without that they no fact recommend process et without that they no equipped given their agreed .
finally , des entitled biological need le cases of des satisfy des regarding le des professionals of la health themselves they themselves interrogent sur M. use or Status information desdites satisfy .
instead M. rule 2 ) 1 ) of M. project of bill , remembered established Way " Intelligence staff " everything Intelligence regarding gentleman year identifiable , le M. exclusion of M. behalf et of M. payments of gentleman big of a American et of des my et executive of novo of his held of workplace .
Way therefore , obviously line relating his health or M. single given le gentleman men identifiable et everything Intelligence regarding des care of health at Way gentleman event of la health identifiable are , Way definition , gentleman uniqueness Privy .
honourable senators , M. Association medical Canadian , M. Association to Canadian et of other Veterans representing des professionals of la health themselves are you very the Way M. impact if that could bringing M. project of bill C Island 6 fact this who took truck le des information gain et le des other activities sensibles linked le M. system of health .
as des honourable senators M. know , M. project of bill designed le assist et le promote M. trade the fact we des information gain tax , used or information " streets M. framework of activities trade " .
he no took not summer together fact songeant le M. system of health .
accordingly effect , I think that well of des people no were not then le M. system of health le M. payment of develop this project of bill .
et this est this who fact that , streets a 800 extent Island that he est difficult of determine Island , M. project of bill could bringing a impact if sur M. system of health .
even if M. project of bill est future sur M. Business commercial , he est obviously that remembered no cannot establish a ground ceremony between similar Island side et M. Business related le des care of health that des worked of health like M. subject of gentleman single ports of des other worked .
M. subject , stated fact words waves , of la part 1 of M. project of bill , thereby that his due le des professionals of la health working streets a company whose Status holds visible est Status benefit of care of health , were of talking people .
accordingly talking M. project of bill influera he sur M. single of des data done le des purpose of la expected its , of M. opinion medical et of la research medical , sur la benefit of des care et sur la management of des services of care of health ?
honourable senators I specific .
i think that he est this of Chief M. project of bill C Island 6 for e le four points substantial .
corporation , M. project of bill C Island 6 must another a definition clear of des information facing themselves youth M. right of M. year le Status life private .
as I M. I fact late , he no specific not streets whatever extent these provisions themselves apply le des information Carstairs .
Way example , M. d 4 ) 1 ) took ) states that this project of bill themselves youth le whole American le M. regard of des information gain that she recueille , substantial or report streets M. framework of activities trade .
this who engaged a Business commercial no est not clear person .
he seems that M. remembered hand of M. principle that means New automatically des worked Carstairs .
however , where finit M. Business commercial et where start des care of health , means no est not clear of M. everything .
accordingly addition , he no there took no line record provision Status foreign of des information Carstairs between M. predatory of health et M. predatory trading .
second , M. project of bill C Island 6 no court not des information Carstairs .
from des rules must be forward fact this who relative des information Carstairs order of hold account of their nature special .
accordingly particular , M. project of bill must be clarifi� et amended order of include , p this who relative des information Carstairs , of des rules specific who will M. responsibilities sur la protection of M. right le Status life private et who garantiront that des information Carstairs no recommend information that sur a Basic , et Subcommittee M. control et with M. consent benefit of M. men .
accordingly addition , obviously definition related le Status raising et le M. use of des information Carstairs should include of des information identifiables , of des information without direct allowing of address M. men , of des information anonymes et whole name of these food of information .
from more , I like do noted that gentleman recent report of M. Council Museum of M. line sur la health took clear resigned that whole extent legislative having fourth le M. Alternative of la life private et le Status protection of des information sur la health " should also include of des provisions long allowing M. brings trading continue of des information sur la health . "
estimates , non only M. project of bill C Island 6 should include of des provisions system for des information sur la health , but he est also significant that these provisions recommend tell also le des areas Public et Privy .
i recommendation that these provisions recommend ; sur M. framework that provides M. Code of protection of des information gain sur la health five et passed Way M. Association medical Canadian .
this criminal could B.C. Status Basic of la bill gouvernant Status raising , M. use et Status information of des information sur la health .
participation , la part 2 of M. project of bill C Island 6 no specific not le substandard purpose des data on related le des care of health et le des worked Carstairs biological be weapons .
from more , he no exists currently no rule , this who suggests Status door p.m. le all kind of abuse .
honourable senators , I request your support order of ensure le this that these concerns recommend were prior that M. project of bill C Island 6 no . his during .
M. government took M. opportunity , engineers M. accountability , of give le des Canadians of base rights fact equity of Alternative of la life private relatively le des information sur la health .
accordingly same time , he est of gentleman interest lost of protect Status capacity of ports of des data le of des purpose of care of health raises et of encourage a wish management et social of our system of care of health .
from this fact , M. project of bill C Island 6 est a extent legislative important et necessary .
he est however importance that we veillions le this that she the effective le des concerns concerns Way des members of la community of des care of health .
i think therefore that we should trying of help M. government le M. Committee fact particular of des change le this project of bill , this who fact limited a extent legislative still wish .

they were all gentleman little waves .
he must understand that , of Way their nature same , des speech of M. another are rather waves .
they are , of special words , but avares of further .
i I always �prouv� a 800 compassion for des Gouverneurs agree et des lieutenants Island Prince who must read these speech .
however , M. subsection speech of M. another me took deep the Way forth because that he makes gentleman new program , gentleman program for des children .
he receiving strong well that I talking of means today today because , as M. took substantial Thursday last M. Senator Callbeck , we we , Status Francophonie national of M. child Saturday last , M. 20 November .
as M. know des senators , p 1993 , M. government federal took proper M. 20 November Day national of M. child order of the two events figures of M. UN , le whether M. adoption , M. 20 November 1959 , of la Declaration of des rights of M. child et M. adoption , M. 20 November 1989 , of la Convention respecting le des rights of M. child .
des young of today today are des leadership of tomorrow .
for ensure le our children M. better tributes possible streets Status life , we must b now streets M. future , streets their future .
des experience et des research scientists story that M. Prime development of gentleman child the his success le M. age day .
instead M. increase of M. new millennium , we must see le this that our children facilities des the et des benefits necessary for that our society either serious et the .
des children were need of our love , of our support et of our by , but they were also need of opportunities for learned .
their needs basic must be say .
more tard regard after Island afternoon , I lisais gentleman speech of M. Senator Gill sur des aboriginal le M. Canada .
this est victims , but des needs basic of des children aboriginal are welcome say .
accordingly 1989 , all des parties parties le Status chamber of des House were passed a resolution designed M. material of la poverty home des children prior M. year 2000 .
as M. Senator Cohen M. knows , we caught fact November 99 et , unfortunately , we we taken of M. an Way report le 1989 .
however , I hope that , thanks le this speech of M. another et le M. budget who themselves fact comes , des Conference able do of des progress le regard regard .
from whole clearly , we no I not our objective for M. year 2000 , but he must expect that we entamerons M. millennium of M. good feet .
la poverty visit all des aspects of M. development of gentleman child , too well le term that le term term .
means making streets M. within of la mother , with a concerned nutrition , et themselves going everything le M. term of des years of Training , affectant all des aspects of la growth et nuisant le M. success .
reflecting no can themselves expect le this that gentleman child whose des needs basic Island bearing , hydro et Clothing if Island no are not say incurred learned et themselves �panouir .
from more fact more , des programs of assistance social of des provinces per des alone across le M. Canada le accept of M. workplace if .
i no me welcome not le this that des people work gentleman workplace who their receiving .
i think that means est is for M. regions of break et for his own development .
however , if , p with des people le contribute , we no we pr�occupons not of des care le give le des children , who eliminated become ?
i know who eliminated the .
des children manage be .
these families taken the des relevant et des against social will of des workers those .
streets our class , we must participate grant Status priority le Status quality of des care le give le these children .
throughout share le M. Canada M. pay floor no est enough high for allow same le those who were gentleman employment le time full of times le Status poverty .
instead Winnipeg , p 99 , according gentleman report recent of M. Council National of M. well Island be Economic , gentleman false single who took gentleman single child should contribute 1980 hours Way week for reach le M. increase of la poverty themselves he took gentleman employment if le M. pay floor .
instead Winnipeg , for a family who account two parents et two children , he compensated 118 hours of workplace Way week for reach le M. increase of poverty .
honourable senators , he no there took that a hours streets a week .
M. Vote of tax for children , gentleman beautiful program implemented sur feet Way M. government , took unfortunately summer have streets some provinces as gentleman system who their due of reduce des benefits of assistance social .
M. program took comprehensive amendments M. found of des poor who call , but he no took not call M. income of des against social .
des children were always need of their parents .
some of between we we made same if our children adults no were not always need of we .
this est why of des programs as M. Program of assistance pr�scolaire le des aboriginal , M. Program Museum of nutrition pr�natale et M. Program of partisan community for des children were all summer essential for look des basis of gentleman must development le term term home des children .
i I summer very pleased of find streets M. speech of M. another seven commitments le M. regarding of des children : of des benefits more . for des cong�s of the et parentaux , gentleman agreed federal Island Comments for better produced M. development of des young children , a increase of M. income after tax of des families , of des enhanced of workplace more conviviaux for des families , consumer streets M. administration public federal , la modernization of M. right decide , a third single of fund important streets Status benefit national for children et M. General of des potential of learning thanks le a projects of Rescol .
honourable senators , M. Finance budget no est not M. was , but , if I , Paul Martin le prepared his budget , des families poor who call lend right le all des cuts of tax .
all these initiatives are the , honourable senators .
accordingly particular , M. speech of M. another off of des cong�s parentaux am�lior�s thanks le Status program of la period of des benefits parentales same Way M. regime of insurance Island employment .
we the can Island be study of des changes fact this sense le M. regime of insurance Island employment .
for M. payment , concentrons Island we however sur des cong�s parentaux .
he themselves branch headed of a initiative very around , but I hope that , when government M. committee , he hearings account of M. fact that des parents of today today are loans le share Status responsibility .
these cong�s no are not offered acting le des women .
des George were a opportunity wonderful of benefit of des cong�s parentaux .
however , with la bill present sur M. insurance Island employment , if Status mother et M. father politics benefit of M. medical , each of des two avoided a period of standing of two weeks .
this est such because that , surely , I like that more of George parliamentarians taking Status home fact document , even during of as conviction .
surely , when I I subsequently proceed six weeks le M. Hospital le M. payment of la really of my second child , M. a�n�e no finest not me visit et she et his father themselves are many rapproch�s because that this was especially him who themselves involved of she .
M. after Island afternoon , when M. chariot of friandises was , I achetais a . of chocolat for my daughter et I Status him �crivais a letter fact those , because she no had that three years , et I him concern contribute Way his father , who est become his false early during this period .
i no I word that gentleman little after my back le Status home that they mangeaient Status . of chocolat together streets our question prior M. law .
but talking that he fact either , le M. during of Clairvaux period particular of his life , my husband est become very associated le my daughter a�n�e et their who 30 still today today .
la small Child est a period critical for M. good development of M. child , brilliant le term that le term term .
des children who were of des experience positive le M. during of their small Child this better le M. school , they were a wish estimated of themselves Island executory et they are better adapt�s le Status life fact society .
more later streets their life , they were of best jobs , unless of problems social et less of problems of health .
they are less so of bringing of des , le M. and , they the less of term et they are less so of gave streets Status amendments .
means we surprend Island he really ?
let M. cases of a small daughter or of gentleman growers , of five years . who between le Status French .
this est can Island be his first or second experience of M. school .
streets M. cases of children of la class average , engineers of a family ample the of do skills parentales Island yes , he there fact took Island , when they wonderful le Status French , they board their behalf , where they living , their executive of novo , they the M. alphabet , des the et des numbers .
these children are le gentleman payment critical of M. learning , M. more significant Chair M. learning of la reading .
Comparez means le des children who no voice not des numbers , nor M. alphabet , nor des the .
early M. tributes , beginning M. early of des economic , gentleman group of children est the Way report le gentleman another .
this est why M. Robertson streets Status first Child est if important for that we proper , Status charged of des potential for these children Island headed .
according a study that I I the recently , 28p. % of des G the gentleman behaviour antisocial the fact French were appropriate le M. age of 13 years , 28p. % of between themselves !
this est why gentleman program of partisan National for des children est if significant .
la 1993 of M. government of contribute with des provinces et des territories le Status implementation fact implementation of gentleman plan of partisan of here December 2000 for strength M. development of la first Child est importance .
M. program of partisan National for des children Island a initiative federal , Comments et land Island sharing number of objectives of la Francophonie national of M. child .
they the M. same message .
accordingly working together , des Canadians can themselves ensure that all des children living streets gentleman behind of love et of understanding , that they recommend duty as of des persons et that they equipped M. opportunity of 50 their full potential when they manage adults .
streets M. speech of M. another est also control �changes Canada , gentleman program designed le give le % 40,000 young each year Status opportunity of living et of study streets of other regions of M. Canada .
whatever wonderful experience !
i am a wish report because that I I written streets several regions of M. country , et I know that my children M. are also because that they were written also streets several provinces et that they are whatever of speak des two languages official of M. Canada .

this est this that he must encourage le M. Canada .
honourable senators , streets M. speech of M. another , M. government took sworn the his commitment of introduce le new a bill sur des young Offenders .
accordingly fact , la Minister of la Assistance took already presented le new M. project of bill Subcommittee Status , C Island 3 .
i try look this project of bill very real for ensure le this that we no participate not too take .
let Island me of provide gentleman report of M. 20 June 1995 of M. Committee Standing Standing of des affairs legal et Constitutional le M. regarding of M. project of bill C Island 17 , An Status Act sur des young Offenders , part 1 :
several witnesses were transportation that he needed contrebalancer des concerns raises of M. Public le M. regard of la violence home des adolescents with of des information information sur des rate of amendments et sur M. operations of M. system of justice for des young .
M. Committee believes that nor des young nor M. great Public no were interest le this that recommend v�hicul�es of des inexactitudes sur la fr�quence of des violent with violence places Way of des adolescents of same that sur M. economic of des actions .
these which the can significant of des fears non allegations et seen Status population le hold of des measures of more fact more punitives , regardless so of do replacement des causes provinces of des violent with violence places Way of des young .
reflecting established allows say that M. rate of la amendments home des young est le Status net Island this est M. refrain paid le des MPs parliamentary Island , that des young are of more fact more regarding et that of des measures more interest themselves CWB because that Status bill present sur des young Offenders est too low .
gold , honourable senators , according a recent publication of M. September - of M. Canada Authorize sur of des data of M. Centre Museum of la the legal , streets M. together , M. number of young who were summer studies of a criminal thing et who were regime before gentleman tribunal for adolescents took reduced between 1992 et 1997 .
when remembered small des violent regarding places Way of des young le M. environment national , remembered no of that a manner increase .
des transfers of young le des courts for adults no were nor increased nor reduced .
finally , la the of des provisions le M. regard of des young took 38 ; contrary le Status example le M. within of la population , des sentences the le des young are far of be cl�mentes .
according a study that I I the recently , la worth average forced le gentleman young having places gentleman Crime was Coast le similar forced le gentleman day for Status same criminal .
gold , le M. Manitoba , des three higher of des members of their no are not of des young , this are of des adults .
honourable senators , M. Canada available of des children fact where le gentleman rate two read higher le 22 aware streets Status most of des United of des United Island United , who facilities M. rate of appropriate M. more high of everything M. up parliamentarian that fact this who relative des adults that des young .
accordingly the , he no there took that 10 G they of less of 18 years fact where , et this , sur a population of five million of Columbians .
instead M. Canada , he there took 4 40,000 young fact detention sur a population of 31 million of Columbians .
grant Island remembered encouraging that our young are six times et care more , that des young of the ?
accordingly similar , he no there took more of where for children .
honourable senators , of 30 le rate % of des young Offenders are afflig�s of gentleman kind whatever of trying of learning .
instead M. held of durcir Status extent legislative regarding des young Offenders , we should established of des resources designed le deal des problems of des persons fact trying of learning during that firms are young .
des research story that des children who benefit of care et of a education of high quality early their young age are , many less many that des other le be the le of des violent et le of des actions of violence , that this either as victims or as the .
M. Council National of Secretary of M. Crime took recommended of lead Status fight against Status amendments fact standing fact Prime held of good programs social for des children .
honourable senators , le M. early of my time , I I earlier that this was Saturday M. the anniversary of M. adoption of la Convention of des United Voluntary respecting le des rights of M. child .
la sign forward of des rights of des children et of des young of less of 18 years .
she staff also M. role significant of la family streets M. education of des children .
prior Status sign of 1989 , p under of M. right Covenant , gentleman child was considered as gentleman subject refers he needed grant of des care et of la protection .
la sign took amended this example fact recognition des rights of M. child as person , et fact him statement M. right le Status freedom of requires , of association , of meeting , of free et of la life private .
M. Canada fact M. subject of criticism le M. environment internationale since 1989 for bringing essential of or M. section raise of M. Code criminal , who between fact find with M. section 19 of la Convention of des United Voluntary .
accordingly 1995 , M. Committee of des rights of M. child of des United Voluntary took recommended that des view view le M. home or elsewhere recommend the et took donor that M. Canada and M. section raise le Status light of Clairvaux recommendation .
i am d��ue of see that he no est not fact appear of M. operating of M. section raise streets M. speech of M. another .
des media were control yesterday that Status Minister of la Assistance required this week of des changes le M. Code criminal order of protect more des animals against des actions of violence et des abuse .
des change are regarding le recognize fact right that des animals no are not gentleman well et that they obligation fact parliamentarian that approval .
des children are of des effects to .
they were need of our love , of our support et , Way Island dealt everything , of our counsel .
des children were need of voluntary , but he there took great of other ways of the gentleman child that of heard le of des view view .
accordingly really , of des studies were showed that des view view . more , et non less , of violence .
M. government themselves oriente streets Status right leadership .
obviously extent who designed le protect our children et le encourage their full best et Status getting of their potential est a extent around .
as a right veteran , I try hold gentleman call of leaving le this regarding .
M. hon. Donald H . Oliver :
i I heard speak of des measures that M. government claims take for improve Status life of des aboriginal , of des women et of des Canadians disabilities , but I I had coast first M. more real possible , I no I nothing heard le M. regarding of M. fourth group : 22 of des Canadians funds le a majority much .
this est as if we convinced , of la peoples , of M. less Status peoples ceremony that M. government present M. consider .
i no I however not summer learn .
des minorities visible no were never really figur� streets des words of M. government .
we no advanced not part of this that M. Prime Minister Order pompeusement Status vision Liberal of M. new millennium .
i think that means themselves let Way M. fact that , showing le des women , we no attirons not M. attention of M. simple fact of our great number .
we no the not non more of Andrew of serious as des persons lack .
we no caught not M. developed of mire of des media as des aboriginal .
instead M. held of means , he seems that we caught simply headed fact parliamentarian that Black , act , Vietnamiens , registered of des Indes orientales , Pakistanais , Nig�rians , S�n�galais , the , Libanais , Nicaraguayens , Boliviens , et cetera .
we we gentleman group h�t�rog�ne of individuals the of all des regions of M. world .
we we gentleman group of individuals among compete good number issues for themselves serving le their new water of to decreased that of many other are here since gentleman century or more ; we , all le of des minorities who trying of courage des various forms of racism , of limited et of . reflect firms compound opposite streets their The .
he seems that nil of between we no est past of a attention particular or no seems , Status lower real of interest or of consideration of la share of M. government .
given given this indifference inexplicable et the , he est of my build of take Status speak fact this visit today today .
he took guide a part small but the of our community non the et without Senators .
i rise therefore Status speak , during gentleman short payment , sooner of speak of M. cases of des minorities visible before M. Senate .
honourable senators , I like remind le M. government that des members of des minorities visible are also of des citizens of our wonderful country .
accordingly despite of la difference of la here of their peau , of la form of their influence , of their responsibilities or of their free , they compound part part of our vast family Canadian .
he no must not des should nor their however of Stanbury , as remembered M. took shortfall fact streets M. speech of M. another .
according des months own , 32p. % of des Columbians of Toronto are of des members of minorities visible , everything as 31p. % of des Columbians of Vancouver , per % of des Columbians of Calgary , 12 % of des Columbians of Montreal et cent % of des Columbians of Halifax .
instead M. during of des next years , these numbers top still increasing .
the Canada meets that he there speaks something 7 million of members of minorities visible le M. Canada fact 2016 .
if becomes est M. cases , they will 20 % of la population Canadian .
accordingly despite of their number always programs , des members of des minorities visible are develop held le M. gap of M. flot Main of la society .
honourable senators , at around of you .
des minorities visible future per % of our population .
future Island tracked per % of M. Senate or of la chamber of des House ?
et that fact est Island he streets des forces Forces , M. order news or M. industry bancaire ?
how of seeking of except most Island you who recommend members of minorities visible ?
how themselves fact Island he that Status this no seems not find of members of minorities visible for take share le his many direct of arguments et le his many shows of continuing .
how means themselves fact Island he , p effect ?
M. exclusion of members of minorities visible of their just share of des jobs est gentleman phenomenon who visit all des areas of our society .
la visible public of M. Canada fact est gentleman great example .
M. Department of la National national account less of 500 members of minorities visible sur gentleman total de17 40,000 employees civil , et M. September - of M. Canada fact account le worth cancelled among his 12 40,000 employees .
la situation est still more the le des Department senior .
honourable senators , unless of per % of des outside of la visible public of M. Canada are members of minorities visible .
reflecting me words that , le M. material of des persons out Way who , he no there took , streets whole Status visible public , nil Subcommittee Island Minister member of a majority much .
accordingly fact , M. last avoided taken his retirement he there took two decades !
that remembered there think .
he there took useful more of % Subcommittee Island ministers streets Status visible public , et they are all of family " !
otherwise said , nil of des more of 9 40,000 members of minorities visible that I I mentioned he there took gentleman deal no refers des qualities , for become Subcommittee Island Minister .
not gentleman single of between themselves no refers M. secondary , M. experience et M. whether Island do for exercise these duties .
this est difficult le grounds !
however , this no est not a issue of time ; this est a issue of Clairvaux .
whatever des leaders of la visible public of M. Canada strongly fact M. equity fact equity of employment , namely they no there common not .
although one , Chair given their subject , I no think not that they there common .
honourable senators , la visible public no est not Status miss le agree of open his closing le des members of minorities visible .
la same situation China streets our own court .
let a last for look le Status last read where we we seen gentleman big of M. Senate who Command part of a majority much .
if you intervention as me , this last could fact become two or three .
M. fact est that , according M. board of M. Clerk , only 1,2p. % of des employees of M. Senate are members of minorities visible .
means represents gentleman total of six persons sur the employees , streets a institution who est the help le give M. example le of other .
i mentioned these two graduate as clearly , but he there fact took well of other .
M. real problem , according me , this est that fact no upon not , remembered B.C. M. idea that he no est not necessary of act .
accordingly of other words , remembered themselves said that if remembered no fact nothing , M. problem dispara�tra of him Island even .
honourable senators , we we already seen , with M. wishes le M. Quebec et today today , with la fishing sur la Coast est , that a ceremony approach no led that le of des problems .
reflecting Crown le des minorities visible of des move field fact equity of employment .
we should fact speak , obtain M. view of des t et find of des ways of courage M. problem .
he that means no exists not no rule nothing ; yet , this est informed this that we advanced .
la same something themselves product streets M. area of des Relations with .
des Canadians . le grounds le wonderful that they living streets gentleman country more the .
he no there took not of �meutes . here .
des assassins no abattent not of des leaders of des communaut language .
des Black no are not the le death or almost Way of des their of policiers M. term of a gone or agress�s abuse streets des person of bain of des Post of Police .
everything M. world themselves stand et he there took of M. hard for all .
M. single problem with means , this est that this no est not real .
M. Canada no est not a Arcadie of inclusion proposing global ; this no est not real non more that all des Canadians . their next .
accordingly fact , very often , M. love fact hearts le M. that , le Status six , le Status turn et le Status haine , yes , la haine .
from des violent commitment Way Status haine are places le M. Canada , even if , successful , this no est not le Status same environment that le des United Island United . Quoi that he fact either , means themselves product .
she took summer battue et noy�e .
why ?
because that she was member of a majority much .
we we of des groups sectaires le M. Canada also : M. Ku Klux Klan , M. White knows Canada , M. Nationalist Party Reference Canada et M. Heritage Front .
des newspapers et Status television no speak known not of la question .
why ?
because that Status majority of des Canadians no are not t .
for des the , M. equity fact equity of employment , M. racism et des violent commitment Way Status haine are of des issues intellectuelles rather that practices et means themselves understand .
accordingly effect , des the are welcome of des achieved .
honourable senators , des minorities visible no levels not gentleman single Special .
firms no looking not of they who are refus�es le of other .
firms want contribute , bringing of des jobs r�mun�rateurs , Queen their children streets gentleman Environment sure , their give Status possibility of bringing a life Mulroney et the , as everything M. world .
as des other , firms want be important for this that firms are et that M. remembered no moved not account of their country of origin or of la here of their peau .
we we much fact enough of progress these recent decades for that means either possible .
perhaps Island be am Island I still headed too honourable .
honourable senators , I I fact le M. early of M. year gentleman speech sur la situation of la community danger le M. Canada .
streets my bring , I I said that I doutais strong that we arrivions really le M. equality of my experience .
after this speech , something gentleman est ratify me awake why I continuais le bringing my ideas when , streets my Tree domestic , I no leave not that des things along change .
i I date that I no sworn not really M. choice .
this est a responsibility that I accept questions fact despite of des item that I cannot bringing .
honourable senators , that he me either licences of bringing few item .
let Island me of fact douter .
i of that of des . rather the le this day streets Status society Canadian et streets des media le M. regard of des minorities visible .
M. access le some jobs rest subrepticement the .
des members of des minorities visible continues of themselves do deal of n�gres , of chinetoques , of is Pakistanais , et of asiates .
i no am therefore not sure that des things equipped opportunity many policy .
la response no est not streets gentleman project of bill Island this est obviously .
we we Status Charter Canadian of des rights et Freedoms , la Act Canadian sur des rights of la person et Status Act sur la basic Canadian .
yet , des or et M. racism the .
des parliamentary regulation senior et vitalit that des minorities visible should be rel�gu�es le M. once Island plan , non .
M. administration public federal responsible many too little of minorities visible , le M. passed that remembered no cannot of gentleman project of Clairvaux government .
from des members of groups sectaires now regularly of des documents and seconded le significant M. . value et origin , la violence et well of other Andrew � .
honourable senators , la real solution le M. problem of M. racism et of des or opinion streets M. education et des trade .

this est M. line who allows of eliminate des , et des . .
she makes of des links between des members of la community et fairness a wish understanding .
however , M. line le she miss no can address all des problems .
he must there bringing gentleman commitment .
he must that all recommend certainly that des minorities visible were right le all des benefits of la basic .
this est means who est le M. heart of M. problem .
i think that he talk fact part le M. government federal of promote regard commitment .
a part of his responsibility challenge le we United , p parliamentarian that country , moving M. regard et M. Alternative opinion .
this est le M. government of tracer Status process le follow .
however , he no M. fact not .
M. Prime Minister et his cabinet were decided of no not hold account of la question of des minorities visible .
they compound as if she no account not .
his Honour M. Speaker Acting :
honourable senators , I fundamental of build regret M. hon. Senator , but his time of speak est you .
reportedly Island he Status leave of continue ?
from des Senators :
from agreed .
M. Senator Oliver :
thank , honourable senators .
their problems no development not our attention .
find of des rural for eliminate M. racism , des in�galit�s et Status discrimination , this no est not a priority national .
from whole clearly , I no cannot be of agreed with this attitudes , et this est this Opposition who me because le intervene le M. Senate today today .
accordingly go , honourable senators , I right that if M. government no means not themselves address le this issue , we could M. do here .
Je Status word of des knowledge et Status raising experience of des senators , I am sure that gentleman debate sur la hearts of des minorities visible le M. Canada study held le of useful evidence .
if we to then continue M. study of la question , gentleman Subcommittee Island Committee of M. Committee of des affairs social could be set le regard effect .
his mandate could another a region of M. country during commentary he recueillerait et compilerait des hand des more le day sur M. employment le M. within of des minorities visible .
reflecting could also own gentleman Committee Joint of la chamber of des House et of M. Senate for ensure gentleman follow le des findings of M. Committee Daudlin of 1984 .
you you recall that this Committee had examined Status participation of des minorities visible le Status life of la society Canadian .
whatever that either Status gone emprunt�e , honourable senators , we no must not follow M. example of M. government fact principles , .
M. hon. Mira Spivak :
honourable senators , I wish le credit des senators who were presented et seconded Status motion of adoption of M. Adresse fact response le M. speech of M. another because they were all two mentioned with expressed le M. behalf of their provinces et regions .
M. funding of la research et Status test far for ensure this funding can bringing gentleman effect sur la minority same of gentleman country et determine M. future of his economy et of his system of health , thereby that M. well Island be of his citizens .
although that I want would of M. speech of M. another , I wish le speak few a of his fundamental .
this est this that M. price Prime John Polanyi why Status " single of la it " .
meetings of a recent time before Status Corporation Royal , he took fellow this charged fact act that she is des universities Forces et s des more best scientists of M. country le themselves - .
he avoided could add that this charged percentage also le M. down of la visible public who naturally , le gentleman payment given , more centr�e sur M. better interest of des consumers et of la population that sur des concerns of des corporations .
M. set of M. price Prime themselves fact est taken le Status political of funding of la research of des governments federal et provincial , who were fact of des universities of des cent of M. industry .
M. Canada est informed too far , took he said , p the Status research industrialis�e le des for of la research syst�mique or research .
M. paid le des United Island United of scientists et of researchers of Prime plan est also M. result , of M. less fact part , of Clairvaux political little be because , noting to , des United Island United themselves are held le felt of Clairvaux industrialisation of la research .
instead des United Island United , only per % of la research career are . Way M. sector Privy .
i hope that M. initiative great streets M. speech of M. another le M. regard of des Instituts of research fact health be gentleman change of des values sur this developed .
des farmers were are this year of des grow records or almost .
accordingly Saskatchewan only , they were product 27,8 million of death of around , of ol�agineux et of effects special .
et yet , their 1,000 Island hundreds et their start of life are leading fact part wishes totally because that des grants federal were summer down le a the of this that des governments approach et American market le their own producers c�r�aliers .
M. Canada no subventionne not these producers products .
if M. bringing of M. speech of M. another was cruel , la response of M. government le Status crisis streets des weeks who were follow �voquait M. " bringing of des agneaux " .
des Ministers ministers of M. Manitoba et of la Saskatchewan , who are came le Ottawa , were summer sommairement either .
M. Minister federal of M. concerned took deficit that gentleman amount Supplementary of 170 million of million citing said le M. Program of assistance fact cases of personnel related le M. income crop , which types ACRA .
this sales represents less of per % of this that des Ministers ministers of M. Manitoba et of la Saskatchewan post necessary .
this spring , M. government a took specific 79 million of million for come fact assistance le des farmers victims of Manitoba .
he said now that he no est not fact extent of plan his quote Island hand .
la Saskatchewan wherever also M. arrangement impraticable et looking le themselves discussed of M. program ACRA .
even if des provinces achieved coming still more , M. problem , this est that le M. clearly , M. program ACRA est far of be le Status policies .
accordingly valid of M. 25 October , M. program no had d�bours� that 227 million of million , namely less of per % of this that M. Minister respect of extent of assistance of 1,78 billion of million .
as he took summer already earlier streets this visit , more of la level of des coastal appointments Way des Columbians of M. Manitoba et of la Saskatchewan were summer why .
citation this that Morris Dorasch said le this comments streets Agri Island A :
when he come , M. program ACRA offer gentleman funding le des news persons , for des news reasons et of la concerned way .
i like same gentleman developed who took summer raised le M. during of M. debate of emergency .
des farmers must obtain of M. money prior Deputy .
passing they no fact receiving not , they no manage not fact extent of ensemencer le M. spring .
this est also simple that means .
reflecting can their offer of M. assistance of all kind of ways , that this either Way M. account of M. income costs , des drop or Status reduction legislative of des rates of transportation that des farmers must pay et who should , of after of des studies , perhaps down of le M. less 5 $ Status between .
M. Minister of des Finance we took performance that M. money no lack not .
M. problem themselves wherever therefore le M. level of la strongly political .
this est why des bodies of M. West trying of small M. Prime Minister of come see Way him Island even des consequences of Clairvaux crisis fact anyone visit le des areas products of M. West .
he took right le Status same protection of la share of M. government of M. Canada that des other producers receiving streets of other country with compete he est fact competition .
today today , our producers of wheat receiving less of M. 33 of des grants whose considered their complete fact Europe .
M. Leader of M. government le M. Senate took book le des provinces of agree of coming more le M. program ACRA .
i inform do noted that le des United Island United also well that fact Europe , this est M. level M. more high of government who recent des grants .
nil State American no offer of programs of grants products who vaillent Status worth of be mentioned .
M. superbudget of M. Union markets est 22 who themselves youth le des grants products .
from des thousands of farmers et their families are milk of vigorous Status water , et remembered us said that this est Status died here of M. progress technologique , but M. industrialisation streets this sector no est not here et no engaged not gentleman progress .
M. time est can Island be ratify for des farmers of express their own message work .
equipment of des intrants who compound increasing Status production et des revenues of M. Canada fact $ Foreign thanks le des exports , but non M. income costs of des farmers , this est a concerned matter who no receive no value le des initiatives et le M. the of des farmers .
M. problem of la family crop est give streets gentleman section that I I received recently of my intr�pide Leader .
i like fact read gentleman pleasant :
until le everything recently , la most of des people streets M. world were nourris Way des small farmers who , various food of Basic for could des communaut local et des markets ports .
but with des rules of M. major , des small farmers set .
streets a vast part of M. world agreed including including le des United Island United ) , of des corporations international were taken fact document of other elements of M. agriculture et materials many of products chemical et now Status biotechnologie .
des small , were transfer Status hearts le of there wide of monocultures of the francophone le M. exports .
et everything this transportation of use food d�t�riore M. Environment .
everything this transportation of food Way pipeline , Way clause or Way flying le des four university of la peoples fact increasing Status consumption of energy , the Status pollution of des fisheries et of M. whatever et percentage le des change , ... ... tienne .
he must more of emballages , this who hormone a more vast exploitation of des Forestry .
he must of new available .
et , of whole way , des food products industriellement are less which , coupled of des products chemical who polluent M. soil et M. water et questions of des problems of health public .
Way therefore , no not protect M. exploitation crop , this est country a resources believe .
from elsewhere , M. exploitation crop no est more small .
instead M. Canada , she can do of 10 40,000 le 20 40,000 hectares .
M. Senator Carstairs took spoke with many of expressed of M. Program of partisan National for des children et of M. importance of M. education streets Status small Child .
i him right simply that , if she means move a new read a amendment le M. Code criminal sur des view view , I difficult pleased of support a ceremony amendment .
when I I le M. board school , le M. Manitoba , we we itself these view streets M. claims .
let Island me of say gentleman word le M. regarding of other elements of M. program who no themselves concr�tiseront can Island be not quickly .
thus , p June 1997 et during Status campaign election , he took summer said that gentleman new government Liberal �tablirait of des centres of excellence for ensure M. well Island be of des children et d�bloquerait gentleman funding of 20 million of million sur five years .
a some of months more later , nil central no took worse summer implemented sur feet .
la question of des garderies est still more important .
i like speak of two reports recent for we remind why we no must not should des services of Access et why we we need of gentleman system National .
M. Prime , et M. Senator Carstairs there took fact reference , this are des new evidence neuroscientifiques who a that des three creation years of life of M. child were of des impact sur his capacity of learning , his behaviour et his health during whole his life .
no not give le M. child gentleman good tributes streets Status life , this est this who written M. real deficit of equity grise le M. Canada , not M. paid of des funding .
second , M. report fact raises that des investments Public streets des programs themselves the le des very young children are also substantial that des investments streets M. education . , high et Coast et streets Status health .
estimates , M. report makes that des communities this very effective le Asian des programs provincial et offices le M. level structure .
this report , as many of other prior him , reminds le des leaders policies that , run they n�gligent des services of Access , they M. compound le des potential of la society .
he request le M. government federal of investir3,5 billion of million streets gentleman system National of garderies of quality et achieve fact principles with des parents et des governments provincial et territorial .
that the gentleman becomes Plan ?
according M. report :
from many programs social regulation des families , but des services of Access revenue M. armature of all these programs .
des services of Access are M. program who recoupe le Status read Status security of M. income et des services .
reflecting took difference le ground again that des services of Access are M. discussed importance of la participation of des parents , especially of des towards , le Status population huge .
M. c of la participation of des towards le Status population huge est cooperation if M. remembered means reduce Status poverty will .
Michael McCracken , of Infometrica , est informed still more far et took number M. number of jobs base be jobs .
a reduction of gentleman billion of million of des taxes sur M. income of des duty service approximativement 9 40,000 jobs le M. cost of 96 40,000 $ Way employment .
gentleman billion of million spent le des services of Access service $ 40,000 jobs le gentleman cost of 8 higher $ Way employment .
this est of elsewhere gentleman The enough better because that he shows that des workers of garderies no less not enough paid .
however , this are headed of des facts bruts .
la journalist Linda McQuaig we said that health Canada took strategy gentleman project of program National of garderies .
however , he seems that M. government of M. Canada no is not this program with many of effect et that he no fact fact not Status promoting .
from more , he no est not fact appear streets M. speech of M. another of la protection of la health of des children against des threat related .
let Island me of you give gentleman example .
we know that des incin�rateurs becoming , some build et des people who compound br�ler of M. wood dealt �mettent of des dioxines streets M. Environment .
we know that of des year of Clairvaux safe countries very the themselves friends streets our food .
if still , remembered implementing wherever streets M. milk maternel le of des levels 40 read senior le Status leaves streets gentleman steak .
a opportunity fact gold themselves est introduced , obviously , le M. during of M. debate sur M. project of bill C Island 6 , for ensure le this that des dioxines recommend for bannies et officer des enjoy , des governments provincial et des businesses of change their process the .
M. government took sworn witnesses M. opportunity of do evidence of exercise fact n�gociant gentleman dealt Covenant of prohibition of des dioxines order that des Canadians recommend protection against M. transportation atmosph�rique sur of openness the of des dioxines et of other products chemical said .
however , he no est not too later Island remembered can always act .
streets M. speech of M. another , he est said that of des measures manage taken sur des pesticides .
these measures themselves compound expect since long , because he exists now something 6 40,000 products the who are back le M. Canada .
gold , as M. Auditor General M. took resigned , no hour no est recueillie sur M. use of des pesticides et we no know not non more pressure are all their ingr�dients , because recommendation des ingr�dients active must be record back , then that des huiles or solvants directly used as other military draw much .
des effects of des pesticides sur des children no are not mesur�s .
banking des effects sur des adults M. are .
his Honour M. Speaker Acting :
i fundamental of regret M. Senator , but his time of speak est you .
M. Senator Spivak :
Weizmann Island I finishing my comments , honourable senators ?
his Honour M. Speaker Acting :
est Island this of agreed , honourable senators ?
from des Senators :
from agreed .
M. Senator Spivak :
he no themselves branch headed that of few Island few of des fundamental of la Act sur des products antiparasitaires of 1969 , who est West d�pass�e .
he there took five years , M. government took realized Public M. " book mauve " , streets cetera he took proposed gentleman new system regulatory , Pope M. find of interests right of concerned Canada , who branch le Status read as move et as body of regulatory of des products antiparasitaires .
M. power of regulatory took summer transf�r� le M. Minister of la health .
five years more later , no bill no took worse summer introduced .
as M. say companies . S . Eliot , perhaps Island remembered themselves expect le this that nothing no up themselves . between Status thinking et M. partisan ?
fact that , if M. government took recognized M. find of interest who account le M. level of des pesticides , he leading of see M. find of interest who exists le M. level of des issues of la security food et of M. Environment .
M. Personnel Canadian of inspection of des food , Way example , promotrice of la biotechnologie , run est the fact situation of find when she themselves est seen making , Way M. project of bill C Island 6 , la responsibility of M. assessment of M. effect sur M. Environment of la companies upon of des plantes et of des animals .
this was the M. role of continues Canada .
M. another issue whose I like speak few , this est similar of M. change take .
M. speech of M. another said that M. government the with des other orders of government for meet M. commitment taken Way our country le Kyoto .
for those who lend need that remembered M. their reminds , M. commitment taken le Kyoto was a way for des country , there including M. Canada , who no sons not therefore des commitments taken le Rio of blood Status opposite .
hence nearly of a domestic that des country were early of reduce des television of gas le effect of regarding et M. Canada , between other country , no took worse established nil plan .
this that I wish say est very simple .
M. cost of des control compensation Way des natural Natural streets M. world opinion all des five le ten years .
accordingly Nova , they themselves chiffraient le less of 10 billion of million Way year .
instead subsection , they themselves chiffrent le more of positions billion .
M. year last , des companies of just le M. Canada were subsequently pay million billion of million .
M. hon. by by :
i I extensive my career of lawyer fact of .
i me am same mesur� , meetings of a elected federal , et means for my more great and , le � , M. son of R�al , as remembered M. why all headed Island devastating .
today today , he rest service days prior of open M. champagne that many d�gusteront M. 31 December for f�ter , le the , M. pleasant streets gentleman another century et gentleman another millennium .
yet , des soon trade of des United Island United le big price , who garniront M. plateau , party le several that they no can more understanding tree that prior le M. outside of M. country .
accordingly effect , M. expenditures Museum took system of M. 33 of his value since des years positions , whose a right part during des three recent years .
des employees families are tax fact million parliamentarians .
their as , who into more le des United Island United , voyagent .
during that des property Island the education , des small are le M. regime because their pay worth tremendous Subcommittee for each expenditures able Way des Americans , et they must pay the $ for each of their , fact organization of des United Island United .
i know that M. remembered putting me tell : " Tu just of M. of .
this well , non ! idea gentleman side , he no est not issue of saturer M. market artificiellement of $ .
but of M. another , I note that M. speech of M. another no secondary nothing le those who themselves met of la health of our expenditures .
M. government no seems situation themselves �nerver .
M. year last , M. Prime Minister themselves the le contempt that this no est not serious if des people parliamentarians no can themselves tribute le des United Island United , since they wonderful le M. New Island Money .
i am well fact favour of des Canadians people home themselves of first .
i issue that a economy well the making Way break Island even , but I wish le say that I no like not non more M. Canadian of r�signation who challenge le say that if des Canadians can go le M. New Island Money or , le this account Island headed , everywhere elsewhere le M. Canada , they no were not le themselves . .
whatever questions et ones set wherever remembered streets M. speech of M. another ? Position response est simple : of des . et of des miettes .
for fact create , he compensated reduce des taxes .
gold , every read that M. remembered concrete M. Prime Minister et his ministers le this comments , they friends always of des reasons for Teleglobe M. payment of act .
instead M. step , M. Canada tol�re gentleman rate of unemployment high Way report le 22 of our with of M. south , gentleman enormous tax accablant , a disette of s et a absence of jobs for des young .
comble of everything , our funding des more the �migrent le des United Island United for two reasons : of des best and , because that tax fact money American , et less of taxes le pay .
he there took sworn of many funding foreign who sign of contribute le M. Canada for des same reasons .
Mr. C . and , gentleman great late et commentator of , took written during of des decades sur M. economy Canadian .
streets gentleman section dated streets Status social affairs of M. Ottawa Citizen du17 November 99 , Mr. of took demagogic that M. chairman of - Networks , John Roth , had reason when he took disgraceful recently that M. rate of tax sur M. income of des duty fact effect le M. Canada . M. paid le des United Island United of des university des more knowledgeable et best of our country .
Mr. . and took demagogic that , streets M. last executive of M. Ivey won Journal of la the Reference Independent Ontario , John Roth took compar� this lost le similar of Gretzky of la high technology .
who more est , the Roth , only 28 of des 400 outside senior of - on le M. Canada .
honourable senators , you you certainly received yesterday , everything as me , gentleman press of M. Cercle National of des journalists , for we position that 22 whose I just of you speak , John Roth , Chairman et Chief of la leadership of - Networks , immunities a conference Wednesday , M. 1 December 99 , le Ottawa .
M. defence of his conference est M. following : " Pourquoi M. Canada almost he non only his more centres achievements et his Post des better which , but also his leaders of leadership of M. industry ? "
therefore , sur gentleman number plan , M. government r�pand a half Island truth .
we vendons now % of our exports le des United Island United et gentleman expenditures low we advantage le this level .
but M. revers of la award , this est that M. government escamote et leading of cases that we achetons also per % of our , of des United Island United et that we must pay almost the $ Museum for each expenditures American .
these , the of M. expenditures engloutissent of des amounts substantial substantial of our bringing .
from des United Island United , le M. during of des six Ministers months of 99 , we we the for 25,8 billion of million fact extra under , papers of alternative et material aircraft , thereby that for nearly of page billion of million fact bouilloires et machinerie the for Status vast industry .
a another expected cooperation of our , est M. equipment regarding et des aircraft of room for compete we we vers�11,7 billion of million le des United Island United fact six months .
according a another study , M. price of des GST American wheat le M. Canada took 38 of while % le M. during of la last year .
from more , when we vendons le des United Island United our Contents creation , whose our Allan et our aluminium fact vrac , we des rachetons very often and streets des products on , p versant a opinion cent if our expenditures est low .
streets our Access Island and , M. price of des soon et of des l�gumes , p majority of Tax American , took 38 of per % since 1992 , then that 22 of des around took 38 of almost per % .
we glorifions our voisinage with des United Island United for objective our start of life , similar le M. their , et fact same time we we work of des United Island United for we majority , r�affirmant le who means M. hear our identity own .
M. trade le M. previous , M. transportation transportation , des fed , Island we Island we enough heard speak of des problems of M. hockey majeur auCanada Island Status research research , des Gallery , la television , la culture et M. plans we special that we r�sistons difficulty le M. attrait American .
M. government took demagogic , far here , that M. rate of power low of M. expenditures Museum favorisait des exports .
this rates of M. expenditures created gentleman discussed of des more Standing of off .
he me seems significant of negative Subcommittee gentleman another the that des Americans non only the our country , but that they are also fact emerging of M. equipment cash , le Status room et fact bloc , although that he no either not le sell .
they compound document bills sur our businesses because that their price est up devastating fact reason of la his health of our expenditures , the Island me , more low same that " Status piastre le Caouette " .
streets gentleman section of Position on of M. 16 October last , remembered fact say Mr. Mundell that Status lost of M. 33 of la value of M. expenditures Museum since 25 years home le a reduction national of pay .
M. body what respect a ceremony d�valuation of the .
he move , p addition , le M. Canada from drop his political of fluctuation stability et of adopt gentleman rate of power rules with M. expenditures American .
Richard Harris , Queen of economy le M. University the to of la British Island British , support this Canada et themselves name streets Status strong majority who no there broad that of des benefits .
gentleman becomes blocage no created not M. action .
no Chair not what , I no wish nothing established .
however , I know that des increases et des , of M. expenditures provoquent of des enrichissements instantan�s .
how of our citizens , who were less of flair for action des humeurs of la m�t�o economic , run the also !
i no cannot not think le des Ministers without , of la learned for des seconds .
these variations subites et prononc�es of M. huard were gentleman bad effect involved .
accordingly effect , scholars Island I remind that now % of our exports top le des United Island United , but that per % of our , fact serious also ?
that M. remembered no fine not that , to that M. Canada will , everything putting for M. better streets M. better of des mondes .
i questions a another issue .
i think le Imasco who , he there took le worth few days , took pack Pharmaprix le M. Quebec et Shoppers Drug Mart elsewhere le M. Canada .
des welfare of continue Forces set le view of look .
i . that this eliminated le M. Canada .
status le M. building of montage of under of GM le Boisbriand , Regina transportation Subcommittee respiration artificielle since 10 years et where des employees speak allows of their turn of a mine imminente .
M. Canada urge of a contribution of , but he leading sur la the raide .
this est because that our power of 500 them took reduced since few years that we we lost of des jobs , that our young themselves met of their future et that we lisons of des Western of concerns streets des media that I hope learn Status sonnette of heard .
gentleman not of him more far , I know that some ways le M. Canada from follow M. example of M. Union markets et of adopt a continues common who citing M. expenditures American .
these , we no fact caught not headed .
i think that a whose majority of between we , Canadians of M. a or of M. another French , we too given streets our bringing National for renier our identity .
this est for this reason that we , of we , , without ground , Subcommittee M. flag American .
these measures opposed allow le M. Canada from deficit his reputation .
honourable senators , I am sure that this est M. it of all des members of Clairvaux chamber .
all , we want � le our children gentleman country fact full contribution .
this eliminated only a partisan of am et of set who , M. retirement of our economy .
now that M. government seems bringing domin� M. inflation et bringing implemented end since two years le Status political of des budgets d�ficitaires , would gentleman expenditures Museum le M. niveaude medical cents American est uncalled .
Authorized le M. Committee of using des documents et evidence tax meetings of M. review of M. project of bill precedent for M. study of M. project of bill present

Island (
M. hon. Senator Cools ) .
M. hon. Donald H . Oliver :
honourable senators , M. Senator Cools took natural his hearts et I wish take Status speak .
for late M. debate sur this motion , I like you send le M. ...
M. hon. Sharon Carstairs :
honourable senators , I the le regret M. Senator Oliver , but M. debate must be motion le M. behalf of M. Senator Cools .
if M. Senator Oliver thus of M. agreement , M. hon. Senator no speaks not Status possibility of themselves express .
M. hon. Dan Hays agreed Leader Deputy of M. government ) :
M. Senator Oliver :
M. Senator Carstairs :
this est very well , honourable senators , le condition that M. Senator Cools no because not take Status speak .
i no wish not le speak now et I am fully the le first M. Senator Oliver .
M. Senator Hays :
since M. Senator Cools took given his agreed , M. Senator Oliver can there go of his speech .
M. Senator Oliver :
honourable senators , for agreement M. debate Authorize sur this motion , I like attention your attention sur des 2 874 et 875 of la sixth plans of Beauchesne , page amount .
they saying this who following :
M. Committee who no took not complete his investigation le Status end of a session can do report le Status chamber of this fact , thereby that of des evidence that he took moral .
he can fact addition established that le Status session significant Status chamber him will M. same file et that he incurred themselves serve of la evidence recueillie until Island headed .
instead less that Status chamber no M. attendance le fact hold account , gentleman Committee no can do report of des evidence outstanding before gentleman Committee recently meetings of a session tomorrow , except Subcommittee form of appendice .
he est clear that des evidence received Way gentleman Committee le M. during of a session certain can be either le gentleman Committee le M. during of a new session with la leave of M. Senate .
M. regard 875 specific that this est everything le fact acceptable .
he provides that fact M. absence of M. approval of M. Senate , M. Committee no can do report of des evidence if this no est Subcommittee form of appendice .
if remembered this M. Authorized of M. Senate for that M. Committee Standing Standing of des affairs legal et Constitutional incurred look des evidence received relatively le M. project of bill S Island 17 le M. during of la last session streets M. framework of his study of M. project of bill S Island 6 during Status session present , M. Committee could then using fully des evidence already tax .
la practice British support also Status procedure of my motion .
la Royal plans of described described , le des pages 635 et 669 , provides that des reports or des refer Island including of evidence of committees advantage who are p�rim�s are claimants either le of des committees ult�rieurs et that remembered going thus M. study of interpellations who no had not summer active le suffer of la was of des both .
accordingly addition , more of ten advantage were summer standard for this practice le M. during of des ten recent years et I I bringing M. attention of des honourable senators sur M. gentleman of these pr�c�dentsle 3 November last .
la reason for commentary this practice est acceptable est everything le fact legal .
as I M. I earlier Status last read that I I raised Status question le M. Senate , M. fact of allow le of des reports et evidence already received Way gentleman Committee le M. during of a session certain of be either le gentleman Committee learned Status same issue le M. court of a new session plans of M. time et of M. money , et this est therefore a practice will .
why hold that gentleman Committee other le new of des witnesses who were already regime le this regarding ?
we gaspillons their time et M. money of M. origin .
some of these witnesses were regime le des costs of M. Senate et we should their ask of appear le new , yet headed le des costs of M. Senate .
from more , des honourable members of M. Committee were already spent many of their time useful le M. audition of these witnesses et le M. study of des issues .

his Honour M. Speaker pro tempore :
la leave est Island she leave , honourable senators ?
from des Senators :
from agreed .
M. Senator Kirby :
honourable senators , as of knows , without doubt because that M. Senator Murray et me Island even we all two summer Chief of practice of gentleman Prime Minister of des Maritimes , I am fact full agreed with him sur everything this that he took demagogic .
streets some cases , des affinit�s ports are many more strong that des affinit�s policies .
M. fact est that of many witnesses were asked le appear before M. Committee .
that M. remembered linguistic M. subject of M. project of bill le gentleman Committee bring or le M. Committee of des affairs social , Chair heard that my Committee the two reports , me regardless little .
des two followed we the .
when M. Senator Murray said that he means to Status question , I think that he the M. Stratton that we must we ensure that we , informed of talking he it fact this who relative des care of health , et I am of agreed with him .
streets Status motion that took timely M. Senator Hays , he est obviously that , regardless regardless if a valid clear est arr�t�e , M. importance est that we entamions our work quickly .
he compensated that M. Committee seat le rely of afternoon , when , far streets Status evening , et that he fact consistent tree Tuesday et Wednesday .
from where my notice of motion .
instead M. joint of M. Senator Murray , I think that we must start le look Status question quickly .
as he M. said , if M. Committee mind happen le Status concluded that gentleman amendment le M. project of bill was Haidasz , everything as him , I estimated that he citing significant that M. Senate whole M. project of bill le Status chamber of des House le time for that she M. threat prior des making of l .
streets M. together , I am of agreed with M. Senator Murray .
i no I nothing le been sur la safe of M. project of motion of M. Senator Hays , le condition that we proper limit Status appear of la valid et everything simply can , Way written or Way a agreement between des senators , that M. Committee take this project of bill quickly et of a manner effective .
M. hon. Deputy A . Kinsella ( Chief Deputy of M. Opposition ) :
i think that we we using et found gentleman model who recueille M. consent of des served et of M. Opposition le M. Senate .
i think that we should send today today M. project of bill le M. Committee Standing Standing of des affairs social , of des science et of la technology .
reflecting themselves est heard for that M. Committee consistent his workplace et M. consistent with can , to that he retain all des potential of hear des witnesses that he judge necessary of evidence .
as Status question took summer raised during M. debate , la proposal supporting that M. Committee consider of introduce gentleman report fact two parts or two reports says no took not dangerous of importance .
M. Committee sonderait M. view of his members et themselves the then .
we caught know of des get parliamentarians that require Status participation of M. another place .
i am fact extent of say that M. Opposition no opposera nil indicate for do whether le M. another place that gentleman good report took summer prepared et a good decision taken Way M. Senate .
for this who est of la procedure , reluctantly that I I Status speak , I pleased pleased of novo a motion , le less that gentleman another Senator no because intervene sur la question .
M. Senator Hays :
honourable senators , I should can Island be leadership that des senators of this side Island side are side le change Status motion , sooner of limit Status appear of la valid of Presented of M. report et , of M. same encourage , PLAR M. referred le M. Committee bring .
having heard des senators Murray et Kinsella , I think that this no est not necessary for we .
Way therefore , I accept that Status motion no 50 not of approval elements .
if this est this that M. Senator Kinsella took fact head , I no me there welcome not , I am of agreed .
M. hon. John Lynch Island Staunton ( Chief of M. Opposition ) :
honourable senators , I request a in , because I inform regional that I no understand not very well this that remembered us request .
how des witnesses , who are impatients of speak of this project of bill according M. Senator Kirby , top Island they help M. Committee le study M. subject of M. project of bill ?
i no do not this that all these witnesses , who were of des will le forward le M. regard of lapartie 1 or 2 or of gentleman section whatever , navigation contribute if M. subject est out le M. Committee .
i no understand not this that we me of do .
i no wish not brouiller des cartes , but he me seems that we should proceed fact two process .
then , des witnesses themselves pr�senteraient before M. Committee for speak of M. project of bill him Island even .
if we we transformons fact Committee bring , des witnesses who were regime before M. Committee learned M. subject of M. project of bill top Island they back before M. Committee bring for speak of M. project of bill him Island even ?

M. Senator Hays :
honourable senators , I ask can Island be answer .
everything means est enough new for me , but I sworn des same concerns that M. Senator .
he themselves branch here of a issue of procedure .
if M. project of bill must how le M. reading of la second reading , then his second reading must how next le M. Order .
for that M. project of bill rest name fact second reading le M. Order , he must how before M. Senate .
la motion est introduced as she M. est for that M.

we we Status majority of this side Island side , but you you des keep of M. 1997 .
M. purpose of everything means , this est of trying of bringing a solution fact under of M. section service rather that of M. section 39 .
he seems that everything putting very well .
i hope well that a motion eliminated introduced .
for des reasons that I I situation , I no think not that M. project of bill nor his study no manage Iraq of M. fact that M. Committee eliminated before of M. subject of M. project of bill rather that of this last fact parliamentarian that becomes .
M. Senator Murray :

M. hon. Deputy A . Kinsella ( Chief Deputy of M. Opposition ) :
honourable senators , I am very the that M. auteure of M. project of bill either still , today today et no incurred not speak of this project of bill .
yesterday , I I share des comments of M. Senator Opposition Island Staunton regarding M. project of bill S Island 3 .
he took negative his speech Way a how very important .
means visit M. subject fact equity of Alternative of des rights of la person of gentleman of des country bodies of this dealt , le whether M. Ouzb�kistan .
he me seems , honourable senators , that Status question serious who should be le M. spirit of all des honourable senators est of whether if , p parliamentarian that country , we want sent gentleman system et attention M. attention of des authorities of M. Ouzb�kistan sur their subject fact equity of Alternative of des rights of la person .
M. Senator Opposition Island Staunton took quote two reports of to and and who parlaient of abuses document�es of des rights of la person et signalaient also that our own Department of des Foreign Foreign had fact his honourable gentleman number number of documents debates le M. subject giving of this country fact equity of Alternative of des rights of la person .
honourable senators , notwithstanding our political foreign of commitment be whose we we M. opportunity of speak of time le another streets this visit , he est issue streets this cases Island side of a relationship bilateral .
he me seems that if M. commitment be must , talking that this either , he . many if we could say le gentleman country that we caught . , but that we no caught not loans le authorities gentleman dealt with him le suffer of his subject domestic fact equity of Alternative of des rights of la person .
this est informed Status reason for commentary we , this country of M. due of M. project of bill S Island 3 .
honourable senators , la question of abuses with et want of des rights of la person no est not a something that we should take le Status manner fact parliamentarian that society open et democratic .
as des honourable senators M. know , la resolution 1503 of des United Voluntary talking directly of des abuses with et want of des rights of la person et of M. accountability of all des members of la community internationale of take of des measures positive et of contribute their support Kim for eliminate this kind of abuses of des rights of la person .
honourable senators , this est a opportunity fact gold for M. Canada from procedures gentleman message very clear et hon. .
we can say that we no retardons not Status implementation fact implementation of include le M. regard of several country initiative Way this project of bill , but only fact this who relative this country fact particular , le suffer of his abuses . , but et want of des rights of la person .
means we tell of say that we no wish not late gentleman dealt with this country .
honourable senators , that we would M. responsibilities sur des conventions of Vienne Authorize sur la implementation fact implementation of des include international or sur some of des include international disability des rights of M. man , as M. Social Covenant relatifaux rights civil et policies or M. Social Covenant Economic le des rights economic , Social et cultural , this are all of des include that M. Canada , le M. joint of many of other country of M. world , took popular , respecting et implemented fact implementation et we should bringing attention le des rights of la person confidence streets these include .
honourable senators , I thank M. Senator Opposition Island Staunton of bringing bringing our attention sur M. fact that M. government of M. Canada move that we concluions gentleman dealt with this country particular fact under of M. same right , who took PC le Status concluded of other include that we we agreements fact equity of rights of la person .
i think therefore , honourable senators , that he est get significant that this chamber consistent clear got his position .
we can determine or well of novo gentleman amendment le M. reading of la second reading , prior of send M. project of bill le gentleman Committee , or well , this who citing better H , now that we we raised record this issue , of send M. project of bill le gentleman Committee of way le this that des senators members of M. Committee themselves emparent of la question that took proper our colleague , M. Senator Opposition Island Staunton , et themselves months that of des representatives of des Foreign Foreign et of other witnesses come before M. Committee .
M. honourable Jerahmiel S . Grafstein :
honourable senators , I like question a issue le M. hon. Senator .
i no I nor heard nor read M. speech of M. Senator Opposition Island Staunton , but M. principle that he they est very interesting .
he we est arrived of bringing of des trade le this regarding , not only here , but streets of other local .
he themselves the sur gentleman country particular .
M. hon. Senator means Island he say that , prior of adopt a extent bilateral fact equity of rate , we should , as M. compound of time fact time des United Island United , consider Status his of each country part le regard agreed fact this who relative des rights of la person ?
M. Senator Kinsella :
honourable senators , I thank M. Senator Grafstein of his issue .
i the streets gentleman Prime time that I no do not of session le this model of training of des rights of M. man .
M. experience seeing streets of many country , consumer le des United Island United , who M. were essay�e Subcommittee M. regime Captain , run est , probante , as remembered M. avoided left .
i accept le the M. principle of M. commitment be .
i the for Status right reason that I no know not who themselves greater history this administration public .
streets des protocoles who gouvernent Status conduct of our RCMP of trade or of our RCMP le M. abroad , I no do nothing who des cause le leadership Way written , streets their reports the or annual , M. number of read where they stay raised Status question of des rights of M. man , for that we proper exercise gentleman follow forth group et obtain M. effectiveness real of regard commitment be .
although that M. principle me paraisse acceptable fact . , I no think not that he either of due Human .
streets M. cases who we handed , he themselves branch of a sign taxation specific .
he themselves branch of gentleman agreed Japan .
M. project of bill social many of country le M. number engage themselves fact wherever unfortunately gentleman who we cause le look Status question .
accordingly Aboriginal held , I wish that we participate of a actions compensation fact this who took truck le these Agreements trade .
i examinerais for my share des abuse of each country fact equity of rights of M. man et I d�ciderais fact visible of this that I chair lack if I wish or non le give follow le M. agreed des regarding , or still if I no like not using regard equally of our political foreign for attention their attention sur M. problem .
M. Senator Grafstein :
as must M. whether M. Senator , des United Island United were passed gentleman system , that we no we not still fact meeting Island well that he seems that ceremony either M. intended of M. new Minister of des Foreign Foreign streets his new political sur la security tragedy Island Use under comes a assessment annual est Port Way country , sometimes Way region , of des abuses choquantes of des rights et Freedoms of des individuals .
M. the of State des draw regularly et firms compound M. subject of debates streets des two both of M. Congress American .
we we early no not follow this model .
we we decided attempt of no not do of links .
i no know not ones side of la award I finirais not adopt le Status light of la new political of security of des persons who took summer a Way M. Minister responsible of des Foreign regulatory et who took summer r�it�r�e Way M. Prime Minister .
however , if we must we commitment streets this seaway , he citing generally comes of hold gentleman debate here order of allow le all des honourable senators of fact come le a concluded ownership le Status seaway le follow , le M. held of we fact take le gentleman country fact particular minister Way gentleman project of bill .
i a for Status first read gentleman encourage of look quick le M. project of bill et I note that he there took gentleman or two or can Island be same three other country Island et I 6 well attention le this that I saying fact M. priority Island le comments engage remembered can probably plan Status same something , of after of des sections of newspapers , p continuing of a form fishery of abuses with of des rights of la person .
i committed M. hon. Senator of fact opposite of bringing raised this issue .
prior of we implement le adopt of des rural of material , I rather that he consistent of des comments for whether if we should participate or non le this debate et see if we no should not look argument Subcommittee regard the des projects of bill of Clairvaux nature .
i the then more rassurant of serious according gentleman framework pr��tabli le M. held of proceed according M. questions of M. payment .
M. Senator Kinsella :
a something who me comes le M. spirit fact response le Status question of M. hon. Senator , this est that he est necessary of act by le des abuses of des rights of la person sector le Status concerned strongly .
when remembered themselves fact Chalifoux account very clear , he must act for total these abuses of des rights of la person Way concerned strongly .
streets M. cases of gentleman kind syst�mique , specifically or historic of discrimination , I am fully of agreed with you .
he must bringing a political more i et more general .
means relative all des aspects of la political internationale , there including M. trade Covenant et Status association of M. interest National .
gold , streets all des cases of abuses of des rights of la person , he no est not necessary of expect a c of la situation of des rights of la person for apply le a situation empoisonn�e gentleman kind syst�mique or care of solution .
he there took of des cases where M. remembered can see clear this kind of calling et themselves there address directly .
i no think not that this dealt either importance for M. interest of M. country .
he could however be interesting because that he est always good of bringing of des include with several country .
however , M. Parliament could certainly attention many of attention themselves he off that he account mean gentleman number country .
he est number that of des discussions official were had held prior that M. project of bill fact sometimes le this reading et of des issues were subsequently be raised .
des servants themselves will also sur our discussions et our debate of regard after Island afternoon et they themselves be account that des Canadians taking des standards provisions le des rights of la person le M. serious .
M. hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
honourable senators , I like continue streets Status same honourable that M. Senator Kinsella .
i am of agreed with him .
honourable senators , I think that we should we consider sur la question .
M. debate of yesterday 4 well le our arguments of today today because that we talking of a relationship bilateral with gentleman number number of United different .
we we signed of des agreements , of des protocoles et of des conventions powers with almost all des country le M. world .
M. Senator Kinsella took indicated that deal with M. State who fact M. subject of M. debate froisse his sense of M. le Island sighted , because he themselves branch of gentleman State known for bringing according des rights of la person .
however , I think that M. Senator Kinsella appropriate that of des something of country were M. same better subject .
i like also me assure that we , that he no themselves branch not simply of authorities gentleman agreed .
he themselves branch of authorities gentleman agreed who provides M. trade of satisfy sur of des corporations et of des individuals thus that sur des affairs of des Canadians with some of these country foreign .
means me turn , because , very frankly , I no 6 not confidence le some of these United for that these satisfy remain the .
if I 6 of des affairs with gentleman of these United , as this est M. cases currently for Status society Talisman le M. the , I should accept M. risk that some satisfy that my country give le M. government soudanais le my regarding et le M. regarding of my company no recommend not also the that firms M. bound fact under of la bill of other country of M. world .
this est gentleman another weeks that we should look more real .

i am of notice that remembered no can apply a political general who convienne le all des country .
sometimes , of des sanctions are cut ; sometimes , remembered mind a political of commitment be .
he can having different on savings le different country .
i think that M. Senate took need of a gallery for communities these issues .
M. Committee who receiving streets this cases Island side est can Island be M. Committee of des affairs Foreign , et non M. Committee of des banks .
he must look means , namely here , le M. during of gentleman debate full , namely fact Committee .
i hope that M. Committee refers this project of bill eliminated out committee serious Status question et fact Kelleher share le M. Senate .

i committed still a read sur M. fact that he themselves branch of gentleman project of bill had of M. Senate .
this no est not gentleman project of bill that we we received of la chamber .

perhaps Island be M. Leader Deputy of M. government eliminated he of agreed with la recommendation supporting that M. Committee active des issues who were summer raised le M.

i difficult then fact extent of introduce Status motion implies :
that Status question either matter le M. early Standing of des privileges , of M. Rules et of la procedure for that he consistent investigation .
M. hon. J . Michael Forrestall :
honourable senators , I support Status motion whose we caught before .
a might representations of des senators of our side took product all des reports , we know where themselves friends our Minister .
i no designed person fact particular .
M. Senator Bacon took demagogic that he finest themselves act of a and Way the or Way consideration , or of a and us .
this who est significant , streets M. cases subsection , est that M. matter either matter le M. Committee , with M. consistent of priority that she deserves , sooner that he no there retain nil doubt that remembered took physician des , .
that we tirions M. matter le M. clear or non regardless less that des potential research .

M. hon. Serge Joyal :
honourable senators , I like me to le des comments of des senators Bacon et Forrestall .
i I M. privilege of participate le des work of M. Committee of des privileges , of M. Rules et of la procedure .
la question raised Way M. Senator Bacon est of a 800 way already matter le our Committee since M. hon. Senator Andreychuk took already raised a issue similiaire he there took somewhat time .
he there took comprehensive gentleman victims streets M. system .
if of types reduced themselves . le understanding 1999 , this est that he there took warm of des persons streets our group , remembered no knows not reasons , who no were not a idea specific of their responsibility .
i me remind of attention your attention sur la way whose M. Parliament of la powers Island concerning forward of des issues powers .
i like attention your attention sur two decisions of la chamber of des House le Europe who were Thompson pendant10 days , without pay , gentleman MP who had line M. report of gentleman Committee prior that M. Committee no retain authorized his information .
this MP , I M. indicated , took summer Thompson during 10 days without pay .
streets gentleman another cases , who took summer released fact October last , two MPs were fact M. subject of sanctions of la share of M. Committee of la chamber of des House British , Auschwitz who took donor M. report et 22 who M. took given .
des two were summer implemented le M. standing , des two were summer suspendus for of des conviction access .
they were subsequently themselves have et introduce of des Murray le their colleagues le Status chamber of des House British .
this issue est taken substantial le M. serious streets our system Parliamentary et streets Status Prairie who we , .
la reason fact est simple , as M. took doctor M. Senator Bacon , et I true des comments of M. Committee British :
this est le this reading that of des pressure regulatory biological be certain for part des findings of M. report .
if M. lower the account le regard regard , everything M. system of des committees special could be line fact issue .
nil of our committees no could off his job et do report le this chamber of a manner floor et responsible if , le M. reading important et safety of la Letter of his reports , des the of those Island side themselves has le world , excusez M. requires , le left et le left the
he est , Way therefore , substantial significant Island et I does my colleague , M. Senator DeWare , who fact part of M. Committee of des privileges , of M. R�glement et of la procedure Island that these issues , who were summer raised Way M. Senator Andreychuk et M. Senator Bacon , qualified do M. subject of a study of la share of M. Committee .
we could thus we hear non only sur M. Ethics that we we engagerons all le follow but also , unfortunately , sur M. system of sanctions that we should implement fact hearts for themselves ensure that of des Somalia such of Clairvaux nature no themselves . more .
this est therefore streets this C , honourable senators , that I like support des comments of des senators Bacon et Forrestall .
M. hon. Dan Hays agreed Leader Deputy of M. government ) :
honourable senators , I like add few words .
he est such that Status question of privilege either raised le new le comments of facts almost identiques .

for support this that Milne M. Senator Bacon took demagogic , I me committed of his initiative , et I Status thank of bringing Finance des facts .
accordingly of other words , M. 1999 of des projects of report no must not be one le des media et le M. Public prior M. Tabling of M. report le M. Senate .

M. Senator Carstairs :
honourable senators , every read that I it streets my province , le M. Manitoba , I rise Status gone report who going Way Broken Head , a community aboriginal .
i going before a school called Sergeant the Island name .
M. Sergeant the Island took summer M. military aboriginal M. more , of des two means international .
he took unique fact fact le M. during of la War War World .
yet , when M. Sergeant Island et years home him , during 15 years , he no took could vote streets M. framework of des election federal or provincial .
i I always thought that Status wish extent never taken Way M. very hon. John Diefenbaker , et his government , took summer of give le des aboriginal of M. country M. right of vote le des election federal .
when I going before this school , I looking le Status situation of des aboriginal .
accordingly effect , because that I I aboriginal le Halifax , I I had very little of anyone with des aboriginal .
i des the sometimes when they huge fact city , le M. spring , nuclear of des games of May , la fleur embl�matique of la province .
they frappaient sometimes le Status door et we their achetions always of des games .
this was my single representation with des aboriginal streets my province .
des aboriginal no alone not a part important of la population of la Nova Island Nova .
Way against , their contribution est certainly important .
however , when I I d�m�nag� fact Alberta fact 1965 , I me am fund streets a class of daughters le leSt. is St. Girls High name , with of des young women of this that remembered duty le M. era Status Scarcee Reserve , who was states le Status knew of la city .
this was Status miss school of studies high where she sons M. right of go .
these daughters were always the le M. gap of all des other daughters of la class .
firms participaient welcome le des discussions of la class et abandonnaient very quickly des studies .
very little of between firms , Status 10e year , et I no me recall not that a miss of between firms either arrived fact 11e year .
honourable senators , I like power say that Status situation took reduced policy since 1965 , but Status truth est that she no took not many policy for des aboriginal of M. country .
accordingly effect , when I enseignais le Winnipeg fact 1981 , I me reminds of gentleman young man streets M. during of s of 10e year who themselves est lot et took demagogic of way injurieuse this that he quite of des aboriginal .
he me took commission totally stup�faite .
i me to for streets Status class , p parliamentarian that university , et �coutais gentleman , of 15 years speak of other Agriculture , of his citizens of la province of M. Manitoba , p d�bitant of des Civil et of des things the that he no finest bringing learned that of la colleagues of his parents , of his colleagues or of his citizens .
after me might grants of M. the the et bringing began le do of des comments sur some of his hear , I I understood that he needed do a unity of this during sur la life of des aboriginal le M. Canada et I me am implementation le M. draw .
i concerned no be never voice le across of des or of this young man .
i route fascin�e Way M. fact that he no was not born le M. Canada .
this was gentleman the .
he was arrived le M. Canada le M. age of two or three years .
his parents were the , although �duqu�s .
his father was university of math�matiques ; his mother enseignait le Status Faculty of term to .
this was of des people the .
yet , this , had a view dangerous will sur our aboriginal that this was they .
i thought therefore that I no chair not subsequently be if of when I I summer convoqu�e le M. school of my daughter Catherine when she was fact 6e year .
Way follow of a concerned experience that she had had fact 5e year , we recall decided of M. sent streets a another school .
the streets gentleman new considerable , Cathi no drawing not great Island something , this est Island le Island say until le M. day where he there took privileged a arguments streets his class sur des aboriginal .
des equal were fact of des hear rather .
new streets this class , Cathi , le Status vast pride of his mother , took country stated that des equal no knew not well of talking he was issue .
she took newly M. fact that I route retourn�e le M. education after his really et that I sworn committed a Crie of M. North of M. Alberta as gouvernante .
this that Cathi elected of des aboriginal , she M. had learned of Theresa .
similar Island side him had you this that he there had of better streets his community .
honourable senators , regardless after bringing summer house le M. Assembly legislative of M. Manitoba , I am care visit M. school of la contributed editor . .
in Lathlin , who was then Chief et est now Minister le M. within of M. government of M. Manitoba , had transf�r� des equal of la sufficient school of that le editor . for that they qualified be �duqu�s streets M. school of la reserve .
he along that they no the not streets their school M. experience cultural that they eligible living , that this school no finest not answer le their needs et he wanted that they service home themselves , streets their considerable .
Mr. . Lathlin me had the le visit M. school .
i inform say that this that I there I seen was enough remarkable .
accordingly 1965 , des equal themselves ennuyaient , but streets this school aboriginal where remembered enseignait des free et Status langue aboriginal fact more of M. rest of M. program school of la province , des equal were p�tillants et d�bordaient of enthusiasm .
this was remarkable .
des equal aboriginal were of elsewhere won Status majority of des price le M. a research of M. North of M. Manitoba .
this was gentleman event remarkable .
honourable senators , I I seen M. same phenomenon when I I areas M. school to Reference Reference Earth le Winnipeg .
this est can Island be for means that I am a if ardente far of M. self policy for des aboriginal .
i wish le this principle because that I am place that des aboriginal no able never do des progress that they should do parliamentarian that they no themselves administreront not themselves Island executory , et we we Status responsibility of do fact hallmark that they parviennent le this self policy .
honourable senators , this est gentleman always of polichinelle le M. Senate Island et I know that number of between you voice well des affairs aboriginal Island that he there took - less of aboriginal that of non Island aboriginal streets des institutions of education education .
surely , of des progress were summer progress .
he there took now more of aboriginal who are doctors , lawyers et are .
we we same Status opportunity of rely among we , streets this room , not less of five senators aboriginal who senators all a important contribution le our institution .
but this est a .
from other relevant , that des Peoples aboriginal arise M. rate of per M. more high le M. Canada , brilliant le Status really , this who est victims , that home des young .
these Late are sector le of des accidents , le of des the et Island this who est Status low tragedy of all Island le of des suicides , des young aboriginal body M. rate of suicide M. more high home des young le M. Canada .
Way elsewhere , nil of between you no themselves surprendra of learned that , principally des aboriginal , M. further est end�mique .
gentleman doctor took same compar� this infected le Status small v�role or le Status rougeole , that we we concerning with we fact parliamentarian that immigrants . sur this service et who were executive Status death of gentleman number rate of victims .
now , they long death le suffer of M. further instable .
we know that M. further can themselves function Way a di�te .
reflecting no affecte not enough of resources le Status fight against M. further for that this infected no year more des aboriginal le M. Canada .
nil of between you no themselves surprendra non more of whether that des aboriginal were still M. rate of unemployment M. more high .
he no est not may that class % of des aboriginal use le M. workplace recommend le M. unemployment .
he no est not may streets M. North of M. Manitoba that des children equipped of des the with la justice because that , frankly , these children very that he worth better living le M. central of detention youth of Winnipeg that streets their own community aboriginal .
honourable senators , when M. Senator Gill took spoke of his objectives et of his community , I no I could me prevent of think that we the all enormous of his presence le M. Senate .
we fact the all because that he we matter allows , le M. joint of des senators Watt , Chalifoux et Adams , des issues having of des effects sur des aboriginal .
des aboriginal were M. right of be include as of des citizens le share full of this country .
this est therefore say that he must their grant des same potential that le all des other Canadians of benefit of care of health , of a education et of gentleman government of quality .
we think now since gentleman number number of years a response responsibility le M. report of la Commission Royal sur des Peoples aboriginal .
we no we not received of response responsibility .
i take each of between you of hold of M. government le M. power that he ' M. more quickly possible a response responsibility .
honourable senators , le M. during of des recent weeks , I I follow with interest Status visit of des MPs streets Status province of Cosmos Island British streets M. framework of their study et of their assessment of M. dealt nisga' took .

M. hon. Jerahmiel S . Grafstein :
honourable senators , M. speech of M. Senator Carstairs est place .
he themselves can that we participate fact emerging of create of more centres problems for M. future .
i am understand le Status question sur commentary he themselves est speech .
a another something me agace streets M. speech of M. Senator Carstairs .
M. report of la commission Royal government of des comments probantes regarding M. Late of children , des problems r�voltants streets M. area of M. education et des problems of renvoi the et support acts - le address .
why M. government no took he not still responded with effect before these problems ?
est Island this only a issue of money or must Island he there see another something ?
M. Senator Carstairs :
senator Grafstein , I no think not that this either acting a issue of money .
i think that he there took magical gentleman lack of strongly political .
this lack of strongly political putting perdurer because that he no there took not enough of Canadians non aboriginal of all des now who themselves are montr�s loans le bringing Status suffer of our Peoples aboriginal .
M. Senator Grafstein :
M. hon. Senator Chalifoux est here .
she et me we we caught , sur M. file of des without Island Relief of Toronto .
she took valid also actively that me le officer M. government of themselves address le M. problem of des without Island Relief .
we caught enchant�s that remembered beneath charged a Minister of work regard own .
she took fact gentleman beautiful workplace streets everything M. country .
from more , we hope , streets M. sillage of M. speech of M. another , power officer M. cabinet of act quickly et ' .
types are our product .
means Chair said , p a M. file of des without Island Relief of Toronto , I me am heurt� le gentleman very of problem .
accordingly under of la Constitution of M. Canada Island I no know not if this est M. section in or rule Island , this est of M. government that within des Indian et des lands Indian .
gold , I I summer Foreign of see that , notwithstanding Status Constitution , des departments no assumaient not their obligations Constitutional le M. regard of des Indian who living le M. outside of des item .
from where M. serious problem refers we caught witness le Toronto , headed where a vast majority of des without Island Relief are of des aboriginal who living outside of des item , le M. outside of des lands Indian .
gold , M. government no took fact responded opposite le this see fact this who relative M. accountability lapse Way Status Constitution .
then , who est responsible ?
i request le M. Senator , who comes of do gentleman very course speech , if she took explor� this see fact equity of responsibility et if we , of Clairvaux chamber , can do something something for strategy le this irresponsabilit� section .
M. Senator Carstairs :
honourable senators , I like say le M. hon. Senator that this problem constitutional no themselves est asked that streets M. cases of des without Island Relief , but that I me am battue streets my lost for a issue results who relative des care of health for des children aboriginal .
when gentleman child est the of a community aboriginal et transf�r� streets gentleman serving for children of gentleman central of des science of la health , all des care at le regard child are le Status absent of M. government federal because that he themselves branch of gentleman child experience streets a community aboriginal who provincial therefore of la responsibility federal .
however , for of des reasons that I no understand not , la province of M. Manitoba , est responsible of des services of care le home .
Way follow of a in of jurisdiction between M. Minister Comments of la health et his its federal , these children aboriginal remain often le M. Hospital because that , a read that they our streets their community , nil serving of care no their est responsibility .
des taxpayers parliamentarians pay therefore more for that these children recommend soign�s le M. Hospital .
this who est more significant , these children are should of their family et of their community et no can not maximiser their wish of gu�rison fact Chair representations of des effects who des . et themselves fact leading M. better .
i chair well whom bringing a solution le move le M. Senator .
everything this that I assure him say est that we must hold many of other debates as 22 . Way M. Senator Gill , p ongoing that M. another place themselves there interest .

when we regardons M. world streets his together , we should be learn et it of see des huge suffering tol�r�es Way des systems policies of M. world .
M. 20 century took summer M. more sanglant of M. history of M. humanity , then that more of publicly million of persons were summer from during of des means , this who represents three read more that all des Late sector le Status war since M. everything Prime century after , Island Christ .

even if we , le M. Canada , contradictions , he fact visible of des standards international , this no est not a reason for be evidence or with of we .

M. Canada took d�pens�690 million of million for participate le Status war of M. Gulf et18 million of million for des control largu�es sur M. Kosovo et Status Serbie le M. spring last .

even this growers amount of assistance est line fact issue , but des supply military franchissent des process Public without be , .
la really , this est that gentleman development economic issued could do gave good number of des the studies le Status war .
this est headed Status respecting that we should learn desann�es effect .
he can happen that M. employment of la strength either concern streets Status public of la peace ; however , if M. remembered no redonne not le M. Council of security his role pr��minent as miss source of good regarding M. remedy le Status strength , M. as term . moving M. anarchie .
reflecting no can allowing M. Second determine she Island even le ones payment he there speaks remedy le Status strength ; yet , le M. opportunity of M. Youth using M. women anniversary of M.

this - should address des people of right strongly le M. within of M. government et of la society civil le act .
M. Canada no can more themselves material of a partisan d�cisive fact themselves abstenant of vote le des United Voluntary , as meetings of la resolution introduced this year streets M. framework of M. new program et completed le des the India of themselves commitment without " le post of des negotiations her le M. material of des weapons India .
that he themselves meaning of des weapons India or of la war of M. Kosovo , this who est fact suffer , this est Status law of M. right .
how M. right Covenant eliminated he purpose streets des years le come ?
M. eliminated he Way a being military who thus of this that should be M. right or Way gentleman own them global who implementation sur M. Alternative of la law of M. right streets M. framework of des United Voluntary ?
hence Status question research who themselves questions le M. Canada le M. the of M. new millennium .
honourable senators , even if M. lot that I just of tracer est the , this est with hope that I like do opposite le M. new millennium .
my hope opinion streets Status wish understanding that we we fact parliamentarian that community tragedy of gentleman world interreli� streets each honourable of Business .
despite des means , la he , M. number of without Island Relief et des suffering who end of des million of effects Agriculture , M. world earlier dealing moving a new manner of conduct des affairs international , who require a more vast participation of all et who est more health sur des persons .
this movement can create des conditions , le a culture of la peace .
reflecting said often that Status war est here , that she fact part of la nature tragedy et that des Agriculture themselves battent since always .
this analysis est the .
des effects Agriculture no are not g�n�tiquement programm�s for do Status war .
he no there took nil discussed upon right le our nature who product Status violence .
M. UNESCO fact noted that Status war making streets Status head ; of same , he we must do remedy streets our spirit Status new concept according commentary Status peace est participate necessary streets a proposing technologique of destruction mass .
for users M. pessimisme present , he must recognize that Status war no est not here .
la violence ceremony that remembered M. took view fact and , p Bosnia , le M. the , p Somalia , le M. Kosovo et elsewhere no �merge not the of M. interaction tragedy .
as Status haine et M. incitation le Status violence and Way des in�galit�s social et economic , et the le gentleman blood easy fact weapons in , are if she , he est importance et get of truth how prevent that of des difference no . fact conflict of regarding .
M. real problem here no est not that we we everything of la violence is et of government , but rather that we we how act .
whatever that we no . no attention le des tueries who themselves produced streets des regions who no are not le M. central of our interests , or then , as streets Status situation le M. Kosovo , we d�cha�nons a domestic of destruction Subcommittee passed of blood M. humanity .
des � of des points chauds streets M. world story that M. potential of violence can be report Way M. due h�tive , habile et int�gr�e of measures policies , followed , economic et military .
even if of destruction suffering are the , remembered no can much that des parts fact war were the des weapons le M. Salvador , p the , le M. respecting , p Africa of M. South , le M. the et le des to .
des Agreements of peace fact Ireland of M. North et le M. East Island introduction , even themselves they are pr�caires , in that M. forward of peace of M. man can come le across of des stories of find .
since Royal , M. UN took process 172 raise Iraq who were implemented gentleman term le of des conflict ports , there including Status end of la war between M. Iran et M. and et M. regarding of des forces the fact Afghanistan .
la war et Status violence are generally Status died of decisions policies d�lib�r�es .
rather that of expect that of des conflict equipped with for intervene et of consider then le his Status peace , he est more unemployment et more effective of advise Status violence fact themselves attaquant le his causes creation .
this est M. now of a approach for a culture of la peace .
des efforts to of M. UNESCO fact view of promote a culture of la peace are inspirants .
accordingly response le a request who him had summer recommendations Way M. Assembly general of des United Voluntary order that she is M. idea of a culture of la peace as approach fact view of advise Status violence et des conflict would , M. UNESCO took person des standards , des values et des objectives designed le promote a culture of la peace .
w ( 1510 )
gentleman spirit of peace , this est gentleman together of values , of recommended , of traditions , of against et of length of life who direct et the M. Alternative of la life et of des rights of la person .
this est it Status violence Subcommittee all his forms et this est themselves commitment le advise des conflict regarding fact themselves attaquant le their causes creation Way Status seaway of M. dialogue et of la departments .
reflecting no acquiert not gentleman spirit of peace of M. day le M. next .
instead M. held of meet Status way of thoughts Status war , M. Canada should support of everything his members des efforts of M. Secretary General of des United Voluntary , according Annan , who took resigned recently fact these words Status need of promote a culture of la peace :
he seems sometimes that Status culture of la peace no took no opportunity before Status culture of la war , la culture of la violence , et Status culture of M. impunit� et of M. . .
la peace represents can Island be gentleman challenge of setting ; she est can Island be also the of des Kyoto conduites streets of many areas et without doubt , le M. opportunity , of gentleman growers encourage of the of la opportunity .
M. process can themselves be le Status read term et doctors , le Status read provincial et imparfait a read chosen .
honourable senators , these ideas were summer concerns with effect le Status conference fact favour of la peace sixth le Position against fact May last ; this higher of four days took r�uni7 40,000 persons of % nationalit�s different a attend le of des s�minaires et of des program , see of des expositions et participate le a wide of activities fact favour of la peace .
for themselves the of a culture of la peace , M. Canada must develop of des policies who can Status security of la person , la implementation fact hearts of new coalitions et Status include of new Korea , who signed Status law of M. right , who privil�gient des initiatives of peace , la taken of decisions democratic , et des hear decision companies Way M. Council of security .
he receiving finally of change des policies fact effect fact under changes of des billion of million are spent le M. problems et le Status militarisation , then that , resulting of financements , are sacrifi�es of the initiatives fact favour of M. development et of des Kyoto everything also the fact favour of la peace et of la security .
honourable senators , la culture of la peace est gentleman objective up , surely , but he est also incontournable .
accordingly M. absence of a culture of la peace , of des million et of des million of Agriculture wisdom of p�rir .
M. Canada can Island he work fact favour of la law of des United Voluntary fact equity of resolution of des conflict ?
i think that we M. can et that this est same our build of M. do .
M. Canada can Island he themselves the with of des United le des moment powers for officer des country issues of a capacity early of themselves commitment streets of des negotiations designed le ce regard problems ?
i think that we M. can et that this est same our build of M. do .
M. mandate Prime of des United Voluntary Island single le des generations le come des affres of la war Island should B.C. a of des concerns basic of M. government of M. Canada .
la interest of a culture of la peace can we give a effect full fact this next millennium .

i account et I hope that these issues manage the real fact Committee Island of M. less , I hope that firms manage review more real that le M. another place .
nevertheless that he fact either , I estimated that this est gentleman project of bill whose we should urge M. principle with enthusiasm .
this project of bill est necessary for that M. Canada incurred role his role of expect streets M. gentleman of des more grandioses projects scientists of M. history , le whether Status Station spatiale internationale civil .
honourable senators , la participation Canadian le Status as spatiale no represents certainly that per % of M. cost total , according des program , but our job challenge le provide M. September of face the , or SEM , who Education gentleman discussed of a importance important .
instead my knowledge , M. SEM used le M. , of la as spatiale et le fact ensure M. face during whole his life proposal .
M. SEM est seven of material et of facilities themselves its parliamentarian le Sea of la as that le water .
welcome des elements le Sea of la as , remembered account M. system of t�l�manipulation of la as spatiale , who est gentleman much spatial sophistiqu� , et his system of face the .
M. Canada concerning also M. , le visible special , who est gentleman robot le two much .
M. Canadarm et M. system of t�l�manipulation of la as No all des two le M. , et le M. face of la as spatiale during whole his life proposal the of 10 years .
des facilities le water deal Way M. Canada . gentleman project of operations of M. SEM located le M. seat Main of M. Personnel spatiale Canadian le Saint Island Hubert , le M. Quebec .
M. Personnel spatiale took summer gentleman significant that for M. making of M. Canada le M. industry .
M. industry spatiale of M. Canada est became gentleman rouage significant of M. economy Canadian .
as M. Senator attend M. took fact noted , she est le M. origin of revenues of more of gentleman billion of million , whose per % serious of des exports .
she represents 5 40,000 jobs streets more of amount businesses of gentleman across le M. another of M. country .
this est a industry streets commentary M. sector Privy Museum took central gentleman role of Prime plan .
M. sector Privy in approximately gentleman created of million Way year fact v. Island D related le of des projects spatiaux .
reflecting provides that Status participation of M. Canada le M. project of as spatiale are nicotine billion of million et the le M. Canada more of six billion of million et positions 40,000 years Island persons fact employment .
la as spatiale we tell of do of des progress streets des telecommunications , particularly streets des telecommunications without son , who are if important for M. Canada fact reason of our vast particular cost et of our many communities to .
la as spatiale tell of do financial des technical of well of la water , gentleman sector of two billion of million Way year who est fact full projects et where M. Canada themselves thing already as Chief of leadership thanks le Radarsat .
accordingly despite of M. importance of M. industry spatiale for M. economy Canadian , particularly for Status growth of M. economy of la next generation , M. funding amend of M. Personnel spatiale Canadian est past of 378 million of million fact 1993 Island 1994 le special million this year .
i inform say , honourable senators , that I hope that means no est not gentleman sign prior Island coureur of gentleman upon refers remembered Banking of time fact time .
we we fact effect charged le late of des agreements , le we commitment streets of des projects very substantial assure le reduce the Status contribution that we recall accept of plan le M. origin .
i hope that this no est not this who themselves going .
i I said more tard that this initiative his , le my notice , our support level .
i no saying not means acting fact reason of des benefits economic le term term , but for several other assess .
la Station spatiale internationale no took nil role military Kim .
Way example , she no declaration not serve le procedures of des satellites or of des the .
means the that she used acting le of des purpose the .
he must everything particular support et encourage Status participation of la Russia le M. project .
M. experience turn , with la as spatiale MIR , pioneering of huge benefits for M. project .
M. module of serving Svezda , launched fact October Way M. 2 committee turn , used of Ministers find of habitation et of central of control of la as until le M. arrived of M. module USS Destiny , le M. early of M. year next .
des fus�es russes Proton et Soyouz are also of des elements substantial of M. project .
M. Parliament turn no took not still set M. process education of Gas of M. agreement , but I think whether that Status participation turn themselves fact as expected et themselves come .
from gentleman developed of view can Island be gentleman little more the , I right that Status participation of M. Canada him give M. right of using Status as for lead of des experience scientists et technical .
accordingly under of M. section 21 of M. agreement , des results of all des work of research farmers Way each of des partners its his ownership by .
for that M. Canada close M. better party possible of Clairvaux opportunity without precedent , M. Personnel spatiale Canadian took implemented sur feet gentleman program fact microgravit� order that des researchers parliamentarians by of M. experience streets Status views et M. open of experience et streets M. use of equipment spatial .

Way therefore , M. Canada eliminated much of a capacity industrial et of research who him tell of using Status full capacity research et of research of la as spatiale .
finally , honourable senators , he there took 40 years , gentleman young chairman American we off le M. challenge of communities M. new sector of M. hard .
when he M. took fact , M. world vivait streets M. be of la war sensitive , streets Status turn ability that Status competition between des two superpuissances , Way discussions le a conflagration early .
M. chairman you no would streets Status convention le M. hard that a convention designed le allow le a superpuissance of themselves give a the economic , Len , military et to Way report le M. another .

we placerons close gentleman microphone who we tell of hear for Status first read des sons had of la peoples Mars .
we no caught more le des closing of a new border , as M. drawing M. chairman you .

prior of do le M. Senator Opposition Island Staunton , I wish le do noted that his have me seems it .
from elsewhere , he no took not word tell why Status motion est , according him , and .
i d�conseille le des honourable senators of t M. Rules streets M. hope of avoid of debate of some issues important .
i no said not that this either this that M. Senator Opposition Island Staunton Command or had M. intended of do .
however , if M. Senator Opposition Island Staunton interest a have , he est of his build , I think , of we tell his assess et of provide des advantage et des authorities sur compete he themselves tax .
from after this that I I heard et this that M. Senator Opposition Island Staunton took demagogic , he no M. took not fact streets this cases Island side .
my amendment est good .
i no talking here nor of M. 1999 nor of M. well Island seen of M. project of bill fact break , showing le this that took fact M. Senator Carstairs .
M. Senator Carstairs support M. project of bill et discutait therefore of his 1999 et of his well Island seen .
for M. deal , we caught before of gentleman order le M. Rules .
des honourable senators , everything as His Honour , no are not without whether that we no must not we fact built le M. Speaker of M. Senate for by des issues provisions le Status Constitution et le M. right constitutional .
these issues must be were Way M. together of M. Senate .
my amendment est non ; .
i fact I line each le M. Senator Opposition Island Staunton .
i no I not said that he must him restrictions of des line .
honourable senators , with this remedy le M. Rules , he no themselves branch not of determine if M. Senator Opposition Island Staunton took M. right of do this that he fact .
this that we must determine , this est if M. Senator Opposition Island Staunton ask of a manner who est act le Status Constitution of regard place , le Status Constitution of our country , le des laws of our country et streets M. interest of funds name Status Privy .
we we discussion John of these issues .
i try read a of des correct des more and never appointments sur this issue .
this statement took summer eye le Status chamber of des member , M. 30 March 1911 , Way Liberal Lansdowne .
des honourable senators themselves recall can Island be that this naturally le M. era gentleman debate key .
i reminds le des honourable senators that he there took privileged le M. Assembly Island Economic , le M. era , gentleman problem of M. fact of la proc of des powers of des member et of funds name regarding M. licensing of la Assent Royal le des projects of bill name le Status chamber of des House .
this naturally gentleman debate very significant , honourable senators , et I me pleased attendue le this that M. Senator Opposition Island Staunton presented some advantage et information figures .
for M. deal , I try provide Liberal Lansdowne .
he took demagogic follows :
instead our notice , this est certainly bringing maintained le M. right of M. Parliament that of adopt , streets M. a or M. another of des both , gentleman project of bill who took of des impact sur des the of la Crown , means , without M. the of la Crown .
honourable senators , M. consent to home le M. the pre .
he , :
i think that person no M. contestera .
we concluons also , of after these advantage , that same if this Assent can be obtenue le no regardless whatever reading , la procedure brought est of M. obtain prior M. Tabling of M. project of bill .
la be that I I used streets my speech precedent shows clear that he took summer early that M. consent to should be disposable prior M. Tabling of M. project of bill .
all des sources bad authority continue that he can be disposable , consumer Way of des ministers upon streets M. framework of their responsibilities , le a reading a .
he no fact not of doubt that this debate themselves going since of des years .
M. Senator Opposition Island Staunton no we took not said of whatever way he stand e le Status Assent Royal .
reflecting can trying of agencer des things no regardless how ; however , M. fact est that whole initiative or everything project of bill Parliamentary strategy of change Status needs Royal of funds name must of first obtain his consent , this who est a another way of say that " Status Assent must be leave le M. earlier " .
this . , honourable senators , took CBC also streets gentleman another area of la needs Royal , le whether des initiatives financial of la Crown .
streets M. cases of la recommendation Royal , this est more difficult .
means est expected le des sections 53 et gallery of la Act section of 1867 .
this recommendation must be eye le Status chamber of des House prior M. Tabling of M. project of bill .
ownership le M. consent to , he can be extend more later .
little regardless how remembered issues Status question , honourable senators , M. fact est that person no can show of way as et up that remembered can bringing a arguments le M. Senate le M. regarding of M. future of des powers of funds name relatively le Status Assent Royal without look of first M. Governor General or funds name Status members she Island even .
this est specific because that this issue took summer n�glig�e et �cart�e these recent years that I I presented regard amendment le Status motion Authorize second reading , sooner that gentleman debate incurred themselves good sur la question of whether if M. consent to est necessary .
he me seems that he must more that des has consequences of M. Senator Carstairs or of M. Senator Opposition Island Staunton .
i I le M. less set des advantage et des facts figures et I cannot give still many of other the if M. debate themselves going .
his Honour M. Speaker :

we take power change gentleman project of bill who suggests get le S prior that he no either passed .
unfortunately , we no we not could improve M. respecting bill C Island 6 .
reflecting us took low Status light le two again , a read fact Committee et a read here , le M. Senate .
he no we took same not summer possible of we ensure that a 800 clause of M. project of bill had well M. same sense fact French et fact English .
des senators of M. another side were proposed streets their report The that M. government to M. next review of M. project of bill C Island 6 immediately after his adoption .
means tell le all des Canadians of express their notice et of follow des progress that fact M. Minister fact this who relative M. up et Status definition of concepts as Status " regional " , la " acts Island Discrimination " , des " Agreements Public fact equity of Environment " et M. " principle of la taken " .
instead our notice , allowing M. emerging vigorous M. goes assure ask le M. conducteur of back et of you say where putting M. emerging no est not a way of do .
we we M. build of we ensure of la order of these concepts et of ensure le this that these concepts recommend clear d�finis streets Status bill of way le this that they recommend compr�hensibles for all des Canadians .
we we heard M. the , of gentleman former official , who we took donor of no not should of definition this that he needed hear Way " cost Island effectiveness " .
he we took summer asked of no not allowing des servants themselves d�patouiller everything recommendation when they levels le apply Status bill for protect Status health public et M. Environment .
des senators of fact opposite politics do des things compensation et they we were therefore fact of des proposals .
instead real say , a part of this that they were recommended no est not up .
M. review the , ended le M. section 343 , must allow of look M. , of des provisions of la bill et his operations .
we no can not obtain Way where M. emerging est past prior that he no retain organization his parcours , but we can everything of same look M. program of restrictions established Way M. m�canicien .
we can we consider sur des worked of due of la bill , despite Way M. Minister .
as M. took proposed Status majority le M. Committee , we can start Way give le des Canadians Status possibility of express their developed of view et then soul M. established of des things .
reflecting no can deal that nine marine Way day , 365 days Way year , or plusde 13 marine Way day , if M. remembered keeps account of des days f�ri�s et of des purpose of week .
est Island this that this est , ?
revenue , some of these 23 40,000 marine no are more weapons et this citing gentleman real rallye that of consider le des truth .
for Right who M. are still , M. Minister took M. choice between two followed .
then , des RCMP can trying of do Status part Status more project of M. workplace , this est Island le Island say obtain des data who a if M. a le a safe le a leaves hour sur a period of time hour est for for des effects Agriculture or for M. Environment .
streets of many cases , there including for some of des few marine who themselves friends sur la list of des marine of interest made , des data of a are very difficult le obtain .
this est for this single reason that several marine no were not summer r�glement�es .
la described road who themselves offer le M. Minister challenge le meet these process et le R M. process .
i know that , le less that he no choisisse this last road , some build are province le M. continue fact justice .
he no citing not streets their interest that des RCMP classent their marine chemical as directly .
i am d�sol�e that this either something little project , but he compensated many of time for rapporter all des arguments et approach who we were summer provided during M. process of this project of bill .
i hope that you me croirez sur speak for this kind of . .
that est Island this that this eliminated ?
gentleman process being or gentleman process that some build until .
des members of M. Committee like implementation proposal , even themselves they no effective that how this who fact problem .
he citing also proposal that M. Minister let M. plan that he stand follow for supports Status acts Island Discrimination .
our Committee took dime Status His of serving streets commentary gentleman of his officials servants had written that Status acts Island Discrimination , misery that M. new project of bill Status provides , apparel contempt le supports .
we what whether informed how M. Minister stand proceed for obtain of good results .
this est significant for des Canadians , p particular for those of M. North .
reflecting what M. model Museum le des negotiations fact view of develop a sign World sur la reduction of des polluants the said .
accordingly M. absence of gentleman dealt media , M. served Museum continue of be M. low d�potoir le M. world of environment directly approval that des will , des products of la d�sagr�gation of M. DDT et of other products chemical bioaccumulatifs persistant streets M. surprised .
Way therefore , when des delegates le des purpose of M. dealt sur des POP themselves time fact March next le Bonn , M. Minister should be prepared le inclusion le M. review M. model Museum .
from here headed , we should bringing fact our devoirs et given le des Canadians M. opportunity of express their hand .
for of des reasons very practices , I move that regard review role retain held prior our meeting of M. Committee of M. Senate .
corporation , M. program of M. Committee of M. another place est already full .
he no took not still successful le finishing gentleman review of M. system regarding des pesticides .
M. Minister took dollar a important extent legislative regarding des species fact safe et , with gentleman little of opportunity , we should bringing le we consider sur of des measures legislation regarding M. change take .
our Committee no took 100 not gentleman big the of projects of bill le study .
second , this est our Committee who took summer submitted le M. b�illon et who took proposed that M. review making M. more quickly possible .
estimates , M. Committee of M. another place themselves est interested Way intermittence le Status Act Canadian sur la protection of M. Environment during six years .
he themselves est well fought et , p across of - , his developed of view took summer turned Way gentleman government who took word des groups of press of M. industry .
he citing just of say that he took small all des efforts negative , of M. less for gentleman number time .
from this side Island side of la chamber , M. objective le term term remains of improve Status extent legislative .
we to between other things intervene for involved M. fact that Status extent legislative no require not that M. government mind of des measures fact view of eliminate the no citing Island this that a few of des elements directly des more polluants .
these polluants are Standing for all des Canadians , et more particular for des Columbians of M. North .
la bill no require not that M. government respect gentleman principle of pr�caution who means really something something .
accordingly really , he there took pipeline between des two languages official .
reflecting New des M of a participation le gentleman new Committee Museum National .
reflecting no staff not des efforts program . Way of des corporations responsible of M. sector Privy .
he no there took no extent fair account of des concerns system regarding Status health reason of des children .
reflecting cut M. power of M. Minister of M. continues et remembered their Status taken of decisions le M. Governor fact board , particularly for this who est of des issues regarding des products of biotechnologie .
reflecting whether also M. power of M. Minister of M. continues of look des effects the of products biotechniques .
sur this last developed , remembered can M. expect , M. government the le introduce le new M. project of bill C Island 1980 sur des food .
from des groups of interest thus that of many scientists of M. Department of la health themselves are who le this that M. cabinet themselves empare of M. power of M. Minister of la health of protect des Canadians , because this est his build .
i hope that this project of bill eliminated reformul� for M. better .
we recall up study Status question during many more of hours le M. Committee prior that M. project of bill transport no make bill .
however , means no themselves est not product et this est now of M. history teachers .

however , streets M. fiscal of his duties , he mind together M. workplace of M. Opposition et recognize his importance .
our role challenge le debate of des projects of bill et le bringing le M. attention of M. government et of des Canadians des fundamental that they form .
M. Senator Graham took too recognized that M. role of M. Senate no efficient not le urge automatically M. workplace of la chamber of des House .
he do le M. Senate of look more le des impact of des measures legislation et le Status way whose firms are followed , et of first real des arguments of those who are fact favour of these measures et of those who themselves there face .

he worth Status worth of look des governments that we we great le M. Canada le M. during of des between recent years for see le ones developed M. government Chr no took no political et no vision of future .
des Canadians development better that gentleman speech of M. another no the no vision .
moving more far .
streets this speech , M. government themselves autocongratule without avoid for M. role that he leading streets M. economy .
instead this regarding , I wish me to le des words of M. Chief of M. Opposition le M. Senate , M. Senator Opposition Island Staunton .
streets his speech fact response le M. speech of M. another , he took given le M. government of des surely of history et of economy sur des responsible of la crisis financial that you M. Canada Island des Liberals of Trudeau Island et sur those who were looked des basis sur reasons themselves articulent des rural Island des Tories of Mulroney .
for my share , I ask up le M. speech that I I speech meetings of M. debate budget fact early of year .
i I the M. government for bringing budget M. budget , but I I also resigned that he n�gligeait of many leviers economic .
M. Canada no attention not enough of investments foreign , des taxes of all des orders of government are too high , our productivity est if low that she threat our level of life et nil objective of reduction of la debt Canadian no took summer set .
gentleman number number of internal concerned that M. expenditures Museum the also devastating that 60 cents of here five years .
la rates of our continues took typical whole a series of taken of control of businesses Forces .
means took leading M. former Prime Minister of M. Alberta , Mr. Lougheed , le contempt :
i me concern of la passivit� of des governments , of des citizens et of des corporations le M. regard of M. number of the of businesses Forces important Way of des companies American et then , of la lost of taken of decisions le M. Canada le Status follow of M. transfer of des seem social of businesses le des United Island United .
none no est fact , then that M. Minister of des Finance continues of debt gentleman billion for M. changes .
M. speech of M. another announced of des cuts of tax , of des cuts that person no took worse remarqu�es , who no Ontario same not le M. billion up streets Status fund of insurance Island employment .
M. on of M. government sur M. plan economic , des problems such le des taxes , le Status productivity et le des investments foreign were led Tom idea Aquino , M. chairman of M. Council Museum of des leaders of businesses , le contempt :
accordingly fact , we we le Ottawa gentleman government who no understand not Status state of la situation le commentary our country fact opposite .
for themselves , M. economy themselves door well , gentleman number programs of people were gentleman employment , des billion themselves the et des own are very the le M. government .
des people as you et me et well of other who osent ask gentleman change country et of new ideas are often duty as of des alarmistes who no from that their interest staff .
M. on of M. government streets these areas themselves continuing M. more streets M. framework of M. debate sur M. paid of des funding le M. Canada .
M. Prime Minister believes that this est simply gentleman that et I thought that he think that if remembered no fact nothing , as streets M. cases of well of other issues , M. problem dispara�tra of him Island even or remembered no him ask not of account .
honourable senators , this no est not M. developed of view of des continuing who were attended le our caucuses of M. summer le Calgary , p September .
des representatives of M. industry , of M. sector Privy , of groups of reflect et of M. world career we were fact share of la state of la question et of des impact impact of this phenomenon , then that des Canadians trying of be provide sur M. market global .
although sure , gentleman example the of this that M. Prime Minister estimated be gentleman that we est given Way John Roth , Chairman Island steering General of - Networks .
instead M. number of des prices reasons for reasons our best professionals force M. Canada , he true Status rates of M. expenditures Museum , M. rate of rate marginal M. more high le M. Canada et M. level exaltant of Business commercial le M. outside of M. Canada .
this est Way M. ways of policies financial , fair et economic that gentleman government written gentleman behind economic consider des people le remain le M. Canada or le come themselves there recognized .
commentant des correct Mr. Roth , M. these Museum about C . and took demagogic :
i no think not that he because say : " she wish foutre my Andreychuk of M. Canada . "
Mr. . and think rather Mr. Roth means say :
" I no I not M. choice . "
M. lack of vision of M. government , his lack of set streets des . financial et economic , except eye of des measures designed le budget M. budget sur M. turn of des provinces et of des citizens des more poor of M. Canada , are le M. origin of this problem .
M. much of M. government before a really recent no fact that exacerber M. problem .
maple est M. interest of these benefits for des persons who just regularly of a situation of workplace le a situation of well Island be Economic ?
as Marjorie Doyle , St. St. St. , Newfoundland Island island , M. took written fact October :
M. speech of M. another of la week last no themselves . not le me .
his letter described order M. inadaptation of la 1993 of M. speech of M. another regarding M. future of M. Internet le Status really of la life streets gentleman Port of fishing of Newfoundland Island island or streets M. Canada plan .
she said :
la vision of gentleman Canada who fact of la high technology his Allan of challenges seems the , engineers same alone , when she est the le M. payment where you you gentleman man d�barquer sur M. goes his taken of hareng or of calmar le M. assistance of gentleman form simple .
instead extent that M. speech of M. another earlier , plus le Status glorification of all des things cybern�tiques , means me reminds that M. gap between M. Canada from la class dirigeante et 22 where of many Canadians living est fact fact very great ...
... et themselves creuse still ...
he no est not possible that Status small province . of Newfoundland Island island either M. single place where des people et des length of life are poor , lead certain . , Way M. original of gentleman Canada who citing M. ever Cyber .
he must well there bringing not difficulty of Canadians streets des regions added where M. hard cybern�tique seems p�riph�rique .
M. day where M. speech of M. another took summer speech Status week last , la gone Status more fr�quent�e of la small province . of Newfoundland Island island was M. move of water battue her le des jardins wing le M. once of la community , of des jardins where des men et des women cultive of des plantes deep , gentleman little as M. effective their from le M. early duXIXe century , working often sur M. same growers carr� of water .
des men were le Status fishing streets their pipeline , gentleman pi�ge of allure primitive had summer Dr. streets M. �tang community , et M. husband et Status woman who have Status examined fair work .
we no can not remember des deep of this country streets Status the present moving Status technology .
la 1993 of increasing still Status Prestation national for children fact M. year average no means not say great Island something for des poor or des against social , who not des provinces increasing their taxes of tree .
instead M. less , streets this party , we we up gentleman group of workplace sur la poverty , chaired of way very outside Way M. Senator Cohen et Status MP conservatrice of la chamber of des House representing Status lost of Shefford , La recent Island Jacques , p company of M. Senator � Island studies .
his Honour M. Speaker :
hon. Senator Atkins , I fundamental of build you regret , but des 15 minutes who you were allou�es were period .
names Island you ask of M. time Supplementary for continue ?
M. Senator Atkins :
yes .
his Honour M. Speaker :
la leave est Island she leave , honourable senators ?
from des Senators :
from agreed .
M. Senator Atkins :
i you thank , honourable senators .
their recommendations were looked des creation basis of M. predatory of gentleman system of protection of M. income decide et of gentleman rate of rate reasonable of M. income of des duty for des Canadians le revenues low et average .
i committed M. Leader Deputy of M. government le M. Senate of no not themselves be opposed le Status request of M. Senator Gustafson who Plan Status held of gentleman debate Special sur la question M. 3 November last .
this debate took resigned des suffering meet le Status crisis of M. agriculture thus that M. absence of a strategy national necessary fact view of protect et of improve Status situation of des L family .
he no should not be necessary of expect that a crisis themselves place , as M. government M. took if often fact , for we tribute account that des policies are d�ficientes or same inexistantes .
as M. Senator Andreychuk M. took resigned of way if the le M. during of M. debate :
M. problem , this est that M. government federal no understand not that he must do evidence of creativity et trying of find of new rural le Status crisis of M. agriculture streets M. West .
... ... tienne we caught fact full crisis .
yet a read , M. government lack of universities et themselves shows out of understand des new problems .
M. debate that we we held le M. Senate took summer very proposal , but he no avoided not subsequently be necessary .
M. government had a opportunity fact gold of deal of la crisis streets M. agriculture streets M. speech of M. another , et of establish of new board et of des work for M. predatory of policies for Status protection of des L family .
everything means avoided could be follow very quickly Way M. Tabling le Status chamber of des House of measures legislation designed le adopt these new initiatives .
however , M. speech of M. another no letter nothing , none of M. everything for des regions products .
that say of des areas whose M. government took spoke streets M. speech of M. another ?
accordingly this who took truck le Status question military , M. speech took Father sur gentleman market very the , in our forces as of des soldiers of la peace le M. during of des means international et fact Korea .
reflecting wanted , streets M. body of M. text et Subcommittee M. payments " Position hearts of M. Canada streets M. world " , la letter significant , who est probably Status more fallacieuse never next streets gentleman speech of M. another :
M. government continue also of ensure le this that des Armed Forces recommend fact extent of support M. role of M. Canada for coming le Status security streets M. world et he themselves efforcera of increase Status capacity of des Canadians et of des mandate of help le ensure Status peace et Status security streets of des country foreign .
means comes of gentleman government who took realized our the of class World quasiment consequences fact annulant M. 500 of helicopters expected Way M. government precedent et who amounts Status life of our soldiers still more fact safe fact could M. 500 of new helicopters .
according him , he compensated immediately the le M. less 500 million of million of more .
he no est more acceptable that M. Minister of la National Auditor that des forces Forces top continue le fact do more with less .
tabling le this that he said , he no can not , M. budget , because he est too , for be board .
streets gentleman section entitled : " Reforming Canada' St. Military " , M. Colonel le Status retirement Michel Drapeau look M. government le revitaliser Status milice et Status reserve , le reduce M. number of agree of level , le be des duties of la along civil of M. Department of la National of Right of M. aircraft military , le ce M. d�partement of des affairs public of la National , et le the right our soldiers .
for my share , I conseillerais le M. government Liberal of implement fact implementation des findings of M. book says of 1994 sur la defence , that he took him Island even released .
instead everything M. less , M. government should avoid of speak of continue le the des forces Forces , then that he no took same not began .
surely , M. speech of M. another talking of la need of increase M. funding of la research et of M. development le M. Canada .
i hope only that this funding those le Status research research streets des universities , streets of des areas that des universities firms Island executory serious substantial .
i estimated that M. government must go task Island deserved of M. Fund of des scholarships of M. millennium control Way M. Minister of des Finance streets his budget he there took two years .
i think that M. problem of M. debt with , who visit of des thousands of students le des four university of M. country , perhaps be care with success .
however , he must for means non only commitment des resources necessary , but also do evidence of universities streets M. developing of gentleman program who non only assistance all des students post , but also des strongly le the streets des studies et strongly those who were Dr. death M. school le there return for there parfaire their studies .
i there come le M. opportunity of my inquiry le M. during of des next weeks .
for it Rachna Gilmore , who took dime recently M. price he of M. Governor General , he est significant of themselves addressed non only of those who marchent des influence baiss�s , but also of those who , des find et themselves amounts of must .
this country deserves gentleman government who took series vision of M. future who either source of questions for des Canadians le M. the of gentleman new century .
we the gentleman government who hope must .

honourable senators , le gentleman payment or M. another of our life , he est arrived le Status most of between we of we find le M. chevet of gentleman false or of gentleman friend very past , p legislation le of destruction suffering , often le few days or few hours of their death .
we no wish that a something , et this est that this person great this that he him rest le living streets gentleman honourable Economic , streets Status peace et Status dignity .
unfortunately , he sometimes too often that M. honourable et Status dignity no recommend not le M. , Island you .
having summer infirmi�re , I known des challenges facing are witness des professionals of la health fact equity of care palliative .
we we all summer , for down .
accordingly fact , everything M. system medical est world around of la concept of care curatifs .
we no we not learned le help des is et , for many of between we , la death est synonyme of regret .
des professionals that we caught are very know of their responsibility before Status bill , of hallmark that Status taken we let of hold Status death le across of much .
sur M. plan staff , perhaps Island be that Status death we terrifie et that we we of la trying le do opposite le des the of des suffering et of their face et le accept M. Stratton of Court that Status death they .

M. project of bill standing that Status decision of fund these 1980 est acceptable le des influence of la bill acting streets des cases where M. intended est of that des suffering Len , but non not streets des cases where M. intended est of give Status death .
M. project of bill S Island 2 makes a ground clear fact visible of M. intended : he themselves branch of did des suffering Len et non of civil Status death .
this kind of ground of after M. intended est le Status Basic same of our right p�nal .
streets our right , he there took without palliative of des the le do .
i no think not that M. project of bill S Island 2 immediately Status door le M. suicide attended .
i think Way against that he clarifie des things et court des professionals of la health , their allowing of ensure le M. honourable et le Status dignity of their entitled .
second , M. project of bill S Island 2 specific that he no there took not of responsibility justice when gentleman soignant practice M. such or M. required of gentleman single of survival of that M. past , then that he was fact honourable of his means , untouched presented a request , fact this sense .
honourable senators , everything day must of spirit le M. Canada took M. right of take of des decisions regarding his life , regardless regardless if le des influence of des other , firms presence good or news .
each of between we took Status freedom of determine of des treatment Carstairs that he or she means or no means not , thereby that of M. payment et of la way of des regret .
Mr. . M. judge John Sopinka of la Court Supreme took separate very , this right streets M. judgment that he took realized streets M. matter Rodriguez .
taxing gentleman single medical le a person who M. leading est gentleman offence of violence et Status the the took recognized M. right of hold M. required or Status non Island administration of gentleman single medical who prolongerait Status life .
heretofore still , M. project of bill S Island 2 no fact that Chief des circumstances streets reasons des decisions medical are support .
des rights et des principles fact suffer are currently the Way our system news .

why fact citing Island he words for des persons who soignent ?

they must learned le apprivoiser des difficulties et des the that a infected Mr. C .
M. project of bill S Island 2 support des ' legal et Economic of these decisions medical .
i think that M. project of bill S Island 2 can do many for that des wish et des needs of des suffering recommend that streets M. system of health order that their honourable et their dignity recommend protection , for that Status , of la life rest M. objective of des professionals of la health but that remembered top also le des suffering et le their face M. right of determine this who their receiving M. better when Status death investment .

according M. judge fact Chief , a described completed Status study of documents noted , eye Way M. Department of la Assistance of M. Canada et action le des authorities raised , no Command not remedy fact state M. due of des clause of la Charter .
la letter of request of offer no report therefore not maintained le M. section 8 of la Charter et le des rights of Schreiber .
M. judge Lamer written le M. rule 24 of his decision , et I true :
la person who refers of des property or of des documents streets gentleman State abroad term M. risk that a the or perquisition either Port pursuant le des laws of regard State .
she no can not " time themselves expect " le this that means no themselves place not , if des laws of M. State fact issue leave clear of types measures .
la judge Alternative Heureux Island Dub� , continuing le M. behalf of la majority of la court , was also of notice that Status Charter no themselves was not le gentleman government abroad .
streets M. Canadian , des minister of des authorities raised no were therefore not subject le des provisions , section 8 . idea more , she no themselves was not le Status letter of request of offer , because M. Canada no took not risk le Status study nor le Status perquisition .
streets a view dissidente , des hands advise Iacobucci et Charles D . Gonthier were early that M. government suisse no was not of M. everything then le M. Alternative of des provisions of la Charter .
Way against , they were dealing respected Mr. Schreiber least of des product access fact equity of life private .
thus , des authorities Forces lend subsequently obtain gentleman mandate prior of sent Status letter of request le des authorities raised .
la majority took comprehensive signed that M. section 8 of la Charter themselves was streets M. cases of Schreiber .
accordingly died , la study of des documents noted demand�e Way M. Department of la Assistance without Authorized pre took constituency maintained le M. right Mr. Schreiber le M. Alternative of his life private .
honourable senators , several of between you were Revenue of des item ownership le Status broad of des provisions of M. former project of bill S Island 24 .
some common that he imposera des provisions of la Charter Canadian of des rights et Freedoms fact equity of Alternative of M. right le Status life private le of other country meetings of request of offer le M. during of transportation from .
i wish le you like immediately .
this project of bill no took no broad would .
for trying of you officer of regard state of fact , we must of first return le des principles who guident M. due of M. section 8 of la Charter meetings of transportation from .
since section , la Court Supreme of M. Canada took sp�cifi� streets several the des principles who must definition Status broad of M. section 8 et Status way of M. apply order .
Dansl' mine v. . C Schreiber , M. judge advise Iacobucci opinion that M. text of M. section 8 marine very little of as sur la broad et M. subject of des interests that he designed le protect .
accordingly 1984 , streets M. mine Hunterc. SouthamInc. , M. judge Brian a had person for M. first read M. subject of M. section 8 . It themselves mark of la protection given le des persons against des intrusions is of M. State streets their life private .
Way against , la broad of this right was very Way M. uniqueness reasonable of M. standing that took series person fact equity of Alternative of his life private streets des circumstances of a matter hour .
M. judge a took doctor thus this approach streets Hunter le des pages 159 et 160 , et I true :
la cash of protection against des and , des perquisitions et des saisies more no designed that a standing reasonable .
this in of M. right test Way M. section 8 , that she either Parliament Subcommittee Status form if , this est Island le Island say as a protection against des and , des perquisitions et des saisies " more " , or Subcommittee Status form around as M. right of themselves expect " time " le Status protection of la life private , Beauchesne that he must together if , streets a situation hour , M. right of M. Public of no not be importun� Way M. government must home M. not le M. right of M. government of themselves immiscer streets Status life private of des duty order of supports his purpose et , consumer , of ensure M. due of la bill .
accordingly died , since M. mine Hunter M. original of " standing reasonable fact equity of life private " est M. principle structurel allowing of determine if M. section 8 themselves youth et court des rights of a person streets a situation hour .
streets gentleman second time , la Court Supreme took request streets several decisions M. section 8 as having for effect of protect des persons , et non of des room or of des things .
this principle the gentleman change significant streets M. subject of M. right le Status life private .
this deals of M. section 8 no was very nor Way Status concept of ownership nor Way M. right being fact equity of intrusion .
accordingly 1993 , means took natural Status Court Supreme le late , streets M. mine v. . C Plant , that a person took series standing reasonable fact equity of life private relatively le gentleman together of information biographiques of renvoi staff whose care of other persons le his regarding .
M. judge John Sopinka , run my for Status majority , took demagogic follows le Status page 293 of M. mine , et I true :
... ... tienne for that Status protection section themselves youth , des information before must be of nature personal et confidentielle .
given given des values Subcommittee Island military of dignity , of integrity et of self that he being , he est further that M. section 8 of la Charter court gentleman together of information biographiques of renvoi staff that des duty biological , streets a society open et democratic , whatever B.C. et material le Status knowledge of M. State .
he could consumer themselves act of information seconded le cases of des further , sur M. start of life et des choice gain of M. year .
he seems therefore clear , according Status court , that M. subject Main of M. right le Status life private est Way therefore M. effect of a the , of a perquisition or of a study to sur M. year .
M. held where this extent est ex�cut�e est without importance .
since M. mine Hunter , la Court Supreme took compromise that M. section 8 had for effect of protect , prior M. fact , des rights debates le Status life private .
he no must not be used for valider or common , after M. fact , des intrusions of M. State streets Status life private of a person .
accordingly this sense , la court took given le M. section 8 a deals based sur his principle , of manner le this that he engaged more that a simple prohibition against des and , des perquisitions or des saisies more .
as M. took doctor M. judge Gerard Position Forest fact 1998 streets M. mine v. . C Dyment , if M. right le Status life private of M. year must be full , we no can we allow of no do points this right that after that he retain summer according .
means est right le Status concept of protection against des and , des perquisitions et des saisies more .
honourable senators , as you M. know , every year bill a vast importance le his life private et le des means of la protect .
M. uniqueness of la concept of life private est becomes that , beginning that remembered there took constituency maintained , remembered can welcome Status ? streets his , .
Way therefore , for that M. section 8 court effective M. standing reasonable of a person fact equity of Alternative of his life private , he must produce his effects prior M. 36 of la the , of la perquisition or of la study , et prior Status information of M. line .
without this protection , he no avoided that very little of value fact parliamentarian that cash of M. right le Status life private themselves he no themselves was that for are , after M. fact , of des information francophone of a manner to .
this deals of M. section 8 took retired a form paying streets M. requirement respecting le M. Authorized news pre that took levy M. judge a streets M. mine Hunter .
streets regard mine , he opinion that M. tribunal predicted , streets gentleman Prime time , the his decision between M. right of la person line le M. Alternative of his life private et 22 of M. interest of M. State le M. regard of M. due of la bill .
Way Status follow , he was necessary of determine M. payment where this Authorized should be leave Way gentleman tribunal .
Cline had for purpose of advise des and et des perquisitions is prior that firms no themselves produced .
means no finest be accomplished that Way gentleman system of Authorized pre prior Status study et non Way M. ways of a validation the .
accordingly died , according M. more senior tribunal of M. country , M. section 8 between then fact state .
thus , M. right of M. year le M. Alternative of his life private et M. interest of M. State fact equity of due of la bill are soupes�s Way M. due of M. process of Authorized news pre , prior M. 36 of la the , of la perquisition or of la study am .
honourable senators , des courts were also cern� Status concept of uniqueness process le M. sense of M. section 8 . In effect , for that a the , a perquisition or a study either qualifi�e of " reasonable " et non not " of to " , she must , according Status Court Supreme of M. Canada streets M. mine Hunter of 1984 :
... ... tienne bringing summer pr�alablement put Way a person neutre et impartiale who must act of way news , according of des assess access et the , of little , no Chair not evidence , et be Port of manner reasonable et non to .
M. judge Antonio Lamer took series , p 1987 , streets M. mine v. . C Collins , three other conditions who must be want le M. sense of la bill for that a the or perquisition Port without mandate no either not act " to " le M. sense of M. section 8 :
... ... tienne she must be put Way Status bill ; Status bill the no must not she Island even be to ; et Status the no must not bringing summer Port of a manner to .
thus , a the , perquisition or study d�clar�e to declaration very think be , as " reasonable " le M. sense of M. section 1 of la Charter .
until le now , des courts were fact a ground between des saisies streets M. framework of affairs from et des saisies streets M. environment of affairs force .
M. Carstairs of M. matter Hunter set previously themselves youth rigoureusement le des saisies streets M. framework of affairs from .
la Court Supreme took too indicated , streets M. mine McKinlay by of 1990 , that more M. maintained of M. right le Status life private est vast , more des course of M. mine Hunter must be want .
streets M. cases Schreiber , des hands Gonthier et Iacobucci were expressed a view dissidente , as I M. I earlier more tard , those Island side Chair of notice that Status study of account problems le M. outside of M. Canada , without Authorized news pre , he M. right le Status protection of la life private .
accordingly the le this concluded , M. judge Iacobucci themselves est seconded sur M. deals wide et Liberal of M. section 8 of la Charter that I I expressed more tard .
for determine if Status letter of request of offer was step le des provisions of M. section 8 , M. judge took levy des clear Pension streets M. mine Plant Way M. judge Sopinka .
firms sons for purpose of determine if a person fact suffer had , relatively le some information , a standing reasonable fact equity of life private him success right le Status protection of M. section 8 . instead Status page 293 of regard mine , he took written , et I true :
M. review of factors approval Status nature of des information , similar of des Relations between Status part divulguant des information et Status part fact r�clamant Status information , M. place where they were summer tax , des conditions streets reasons they were summer francophone et Status state of M. Crime bad M. subject of M. investigation , moves of pond�rer des rights social le Status protection of la dignity , of M. integrity et of M. self of la person et M. due effective of la bill .
several principles can be d�gag�s of Clairvaux deals of M. due of M. section 8 . idea first , des authorities relating of M. due of la bill must be sensibles le M. right of a person le M. Alternative of his life private , relatively le gentleman together of information biographiques of renvoi staff Status regarding .
M. English of a standing reasonable fact equity of life private d�clenche M. due of des course protection Way M. section 8 . " this standing exists et that similar Island side est that Way a intrusion the Way M. government , des authorities relating of M. due of la bill are thanks of obtain a Authorized news prior of act .
existing M. framework contextuel individuals Way M. judge Sopinka streets M. mine Plant , M. judge Iacobucci took signed that M. intim� had opportunity a ceremony standing le M. regard of his documents noted raised .
these months I of des further gain sur la person line , consumer his situation financial et of des choice , regarding his start of life .
second , remembered finest might des reports who obligation between Status per et his one of relationship of confidence who , presented M. mine Plant , give held le a more vast standing fact equity of life private relatively le des information fact suffer .
finally , if des information initiative were investigations accessibility without intrusion or without M. giving of gentleman 33 , he there avoided then less of wish that he there retain calling of la life private of la person concern�e .
accordingly M. Canadian , des information were subsequently be francophone Way intrusion streets Status per suisse et with M. giving of gentleman 33 , this who 8 le leadership that M. intim� had a standing reasonable fact equity of life private relatively le these information .
from more , as M. judge Iacobucci M. let le M. rule Royal of M. mine Schreiber , et I true :
la procedure of perquisition et of study took summer the Way M. government of M. Canada Way Status Presented of a request responsibility le M. government of la Request , reluctantly M. absence of dealt between des two country .
la request took summer introduced streets M. framework of a investigation Canadian who , perhaps Island remembered speaking , Pius together , le M. Canada , le of des Director , le gentleman average a criminal le M. Code criminal Museum .
M. right le Status life private , socially that he took summer have fact under of la Charter , qualified des persons et non of des room .
M. effect sur M. year of a perquisition et of la study of documents noted est M. same , that Status perquisition et Status study equipped held le M. Canada or fact Request .
M. intim� took series standing reasonable fact equity of life private relatively le des information problems , regardless regardless M. place where themselves friends des account .
he est everything le fact reasonable , le my notice , that M. intim� themselves attende le this that des authorities Forces no qualified status M. offer of des authorities raised for obtain his documents noted fact Request without obtain a 800 form of Authorized news pre le M. Canada .
M. judge had therefore date Way M. meeting le Status question of Schreiber et he had recommended of des the le des laws Forces for involved this impr�cision .
this est informed this that M. project of bill S Island 4 designed le off .
from elsewhere , M. judge Wetston of la Court federal et M. judge Linden of la Court of Appeal federal are Energy le des same findings that des hands Prime of la Court Supreme streets M. mine Schreiber .
honourable senators , he est clear that each cases est particular .
this est why M. section 4 of M. project of bill S Island 4 provides that M. judge appropriate , who can hear Status request former parte , must see that she est act le des standards until Way Status Charter Canadian of des rights et Freedoms .
if becomes est M. cases , he can tribute a described During that Status approach either eye , thereby that M. require M. section 5 of M. project of bill .
honourable senators , prior Status Presented of des other provisions of my project of bill , I like deal Status question of his due would .
streets M. mine Schreiber , M. judge fact Chief of la Court Supreme took fact reference le M. due would of la Charter .
for this do , he took levy des the Terry et Harrer , who affirmaient clear that Status proposal that Status Charter no took not of due le M. outside of M. Canada .
these two affairs The sur la conduct of authorities American who , upon le des United Island United , sons support of des correct of suspects of a manner who , although that act le M. Economy Reference and American , were with with la Charter .
streets des two causes , la Court Supreme took signed that Status Charter no finest the des actions tell Way of des authorities Foreign streets gentleman country abroad .
this concluded est that with M. section clause of la Charter , who CRTC M. due of Clairvaux last " task Parliament et le M. government of M. Canada " et " le Status th et le M. government of each province " .
she est also that , as M. took substantial M. judge Beverley McLachlin streets M. mine Terry , with M. principle of la available internationale .
according Status judge , he was the of themselves expect le this that des authorities Foreign voice et observent des laws of M. Canada .
honourable senators , streets M. cases Schreiber , la situation was different .
already , M. judge Wetston of la Court federal had turned M. point following cetera M. fact of answer affirmativement le Status question raised Way M. intim� would le apply Status Charter extraterritorialement .
he no took never line fact issue des laws sur M. Alternative of M. right le Status life private of la Request nor of M. government of this country meetings of la study of des documents noted .
la conduct such fact M. Canadian est Status dispute et M. Jacques of la letter of request Way of des RCMP parliamentarians .
these RCMP were clear subject le M. right Museum , there including le Status Charter , le M. domestic of M. Canada et , streets Status most of des cases , le M. outside of M. Canada .
they were partisan initiative , le M. section clause of la Charter , p parliamentarian that representatives of M. power organized of M. " government of M. Canada " .
who more est , because that they were Canadians , he no there had no reason of hold account of la available internationale .
reflecting finest therefore themselves expect le this that they voice M. right Museum , there including Status Constitution .
he no was not the of hold of themselves that they M. signed .
means est particular real of des RCMP who agissaient le M. behalf of M. Justice General et who , of fact , mainly bringing of des responsibilities further away of la nature particular of Clairvaux absent .
i wish le mention that M. author of la letter no took not fact urge M. 1999 of la letter Way M. gentleman of his senior .
yet , as I M. mentionnais more tard , this letter opinion clear that Status request of offer had for purpose of continue a investigation thing .
she finest give held le of des Director le M. Canada against gentleman real Museum .
streets his judgment , M. judge Wetston had signed le the 944 , et I true :
... ... tienne if M. intim� can be much le M. Canada , I no do not why he no should not bringing right le des benefits accessoires of la Charter
accordingly died , he took signed that M. intim� had a standing reasonable fact equity of life private .
after bringing Somalia this concluded et bringing , Status nature of des satisfy who sons summer saisies , he took signed that fact under of M. section 8 , remembered her M. supply of a Authorized pre representations of gentleman developed of duties court hope prior that Status letter of request incurred be exp�di�e .
he est therefore clear that Status Charter themselves youth of way general le of types letters of request .
some of between you manage tent�s of say that Status letter of request no est fact be le gentleman review seen sur M. section 8 . You utiliserez probably M. example of la procedure that must follow a province Canadian for status M. offer of a another province fact view of M. 36 of a the , perquisition or study .
currently , des authorities who arise of types coastal of offer no were not le obtain of Authorized news pre pursuant le M. section 8 prior of sent their request .
he no themselves youth not parliamentarian that Status request no took not summer received , staffed where he must obtain gentleman mandate During Status the , la perquisition or Status study .
instead regard point , I the follows .
streets M. environment Museum , des authorities who arise Status request know that similar Island side Kelleher M. subject of gentleman review news prior M. 36 of la the , perquisition or study proposed .

many of Canadians , here same le M. Senate et across le M. Canada , run interest of nearly le des issues related le des rights of la person , particularly le Status way whose these values , who are criticism according our own original of des Relations resources et of la stability social , are want fact China .
this proposals sur la China est here for Status simple reason that Status population of this country represents approximately the % of la population World .
des systems of values et des practices of a if vast regarding of la population of M. world are essential le M. predatory of a society tragedy entitled et Party le M. environment World .

des members of M. Committee of des Finance national themselves objectent le this that his mandate more light either dilu� of a way or of a another .
i me to of meet M. debate for allow le my colleagues of there participate .
M. hon. Dan Hays agreed Leader Deputy of M. government ) :
honourable senators , I I a issue of M. Senator Murray regarding M. state of M. Estimates Main of des spending prior Status was .
he me seems that des Post budg�taies of M. Department of des Fisheries were summer them Way M. Committee of des fisheries le M. during of la last session .
i me request if M. Senator Murray could tell this change apparent of position .
i understand that Status Chair took difference , but why this change of position between Status last session et Status presented session , particularly fact words of this that was M. Committee of des fisheries et of his review of M. budget of des spending of M. Department of des Fisheries ?
M. Committee wanted hear des evidence of des servants of M. Department et of other sur a issue who M. the particular .
from more , I no think not that this est Status first read that a part of M. budget of des spending of gentleman Department either country Way gentleman Committee particular .
streets M. another chamber , this est certainly thus that they the for des budgets of des spending , if I no me understand .
i conclude Status manner whose we the M. Estimates Supplementary of des spending agreed A ) , for cetera some supply were summer either le des committees fact fact reason of des practices of M. another chamber .
we we out des supply having fourth le des languages official et le Status Library of M. Parliament le des committees fact knowledgeable .
i appr�cierais a response le this issue .
M. Senator Murray :
honourable senators , I - of there answer .
i I summer chairman of this Committee during gentleman year or two he there took already gentleman number time , et I I resolution Status Chair le M. during of Clairvaux session .
la . le M. Senate means that remembered linguistic M. Estimates Main of des spending et M. Estimates Supplementary of des spending le M. Committee Standing Standing of des Finance national .
since few years , because that of other committees committees were left look des additional cut for des departments whose they themselves leading , we we decided of discussed des additional cut of these departments setting of M. mandate of M. Committee Standing Standing of des Finance national .
i I before my colleagues of Clairvaux issue le M. Committee M. another day et they themselves are who le this practice .
they sons two assess , if I no me understand , et I cannot you say that of des senators exp�riment�s as des senators Cools , Bolduc et Doody were everything le fact against this practice .
their first reason , this est that M. Committee Standing Standing of des Finance national est M. Committee charged of study des additional cut et he receiving therefore of send these additional globalement le our Committee .
means said , they law that nothing no prevent gentleman another Committee Standing of obtain M. mandate of M. Senate of themselves focus sur des additional cut for gentleman Department fact particular .
their Aboriginal basis was that , if we elected for learning that whole study Way gentleman another Committee Standing of des additional cut of M. Department whose he themselves handed must themselves do le M. appropriate of M. mandate of M. Committee Standing Standing of des Finance national , then this no citing not possible .
a read my motion agreed , even with several amendments , M. Committee Standing Standing of M. agriculture et of des Forestry , Way example , no could not attendance a study of des additional cut of M. Department of M. concerned .
i think therefore that we no should not accept that gentleman Committee Standing either difficult fact talking that this either of study fact discussion des additional cut of gentleman Department fact particular of M. single fact that des additional cut were summer renvoy�es globalement le M. Committee Standing Standing of des Finance national .
means could be ports if we - take of des measures for this who est of urge des additional cut consumer .
as M. hon. Senator M. knows , this no est not M. cases .
we advanced report sur des additional cut with our points of view et our recommendations , but we no caught not food le urge these additional cut fact this .
M. Senator join :
honourable senators , I like tell des reasons of M. amendment that I move le M. behalf of M. chairman of M. Committee et of des members of M. Committee of des fisheries .
when M. Senator Murray took proposed M. adjournment of M. debate sur la motion , I no me am not lot since M. Senator Hays M. took fact .
but if I assure , honourable senators , I like you say that M. Committee no means not create of precedent .

streets this report presented M. year last , la Presented recommendation stipulait that des � of M. Estimates of M. Department of des Fisheries et of des Fisheries recommend r�f�r�s le M. Committee of des fisheries .
this report took summer passed M. 16 June le M. action Way this chamber .
this est therefore sur this report et sur this motion , who were summer name , that themselves Basic M. Committee for continue M. study of M. budget of des spending of M. Department of des Fisheries et of des Fisheries .
i you awarded that he no est federal streets M. intended of M. Committee of des fisheries of empi�ter sur M. mandate of gentleman another Committee .
i think strong et thing that our role citing rather of you help , since if you you le necessity des budgets of all des departments , you no life certainly not M. time of do evidence each of des ministers , their servants or examination .
M. Committee took gentleman little more M. time for study M. budget since he themselves branch of gentleman single Department .
we M. we fact M. year last .
we we caught well acquitt�s of Clairvaux responsibility fact the M. Minister .
accordingly body our report thus that a recommendation back le M. action , we want everything simply continue streets Status same honourable .
M. hon. Anne C . Cools :
honourable senators , I like understand informed this who themselves going here .
more tard , M. Senator Murray took demagogic that he wanted meet M. debate et speak more later .
caught Island we fact full debate or well M. Senator Murray themselves do he le move finally M. adjournment ?
his Honour M. Speaker :
hon. Senator Cools , we caught currently before of la motion of amendment of M. hon. Senator join .
M. Senator Murray :
honourable senators , I me appr�tais le move M. adjournment of M. debate , but early that I I seen that of other senators politics continue , I me am sitting well course for that M. debate incurred themselves continue .
M. Senator Cools :
i think therefore that I should add few words le M. debate .
he me seems that few issues themselves questions le we .
reflecting could des same fact two argument , la vast et Status small .
la vast issue , as M. took if well said M. Senator Murray , this est M. mandate et des powers of M. Committee Standing Standing of des Finance national regarding M. review of M. budget of des spending , thereby that M. right that took thing Committee M. right of receive M. , of this budget for his review .
i think that this that M. Senator join the fact big , this est M. right or M. power of gentleman Committee of ask gentleman mandate of M. Senate for study some supply who M. interest streets M. budget of des spending .
we do today today le M. chance .
M. 4 March 99 , Way follow of M. debate held Status investment , this est Island le Island say M. 3 March , M. Senator Carstairs took proposed :
that M. early Standing Standing of des Finance national either authorized le study , sooner of fact do report , des spending March streets M. Estimates of des spending for M. fiscal financial themselves go M. 31 March 2000 , le M. material of des supply 1 , 5 et 10 of Fisheries et Fisheries , of M. Vote 10 of M. Parliament et of M. Vote 25 of M. Council Privy .
M. Senator join wish fact fact r�activer this mandate .
if M. remembered talk le M. debate who took privileged held M. 3 March , remembered broad well that des senators Stewart et Comeau sons opportunity presented this request .
we must address this issue .
instead M. clearly , this est M. gentleman or M. another .
a practice of la chamber of des House est subrepticement sur M. developed of themselves result le M. Senate .
although that I seaway not of session le this that , streets some cases , of des supply recommend submitted le M. review of different committees , I no wish not that means make a practice before based et that each read that we caught before of M. budget of des spending , that M. study of these supply either Committee le des committees .
means Chair said , I want Status response of M. Senator Comeau .
hence Status question that we must by .
for M. role , however , he themselves branch of whether if M. Committee of M. Senator join , M. Committee Standing themselves interesting le Fisheries et Fisheries , perhaps be opportunity necessary le look these supply .
we able address M. another issue . .
M. hon. Sharon Carstairs :
des he of M. Committee are limpides .
M. single Committee that M. Rules attendance le study M. budget of des spending of gentleman Department est M. Committee Standing Standing of des Finance national .
he no est issue of nil another Committee streets this Rules .
however , M. Rules said that des committees can study of des issues fact General .
reflecting already that , of M. developed of M. government , a study general of des fisheries should obviously englober M. study of M. budget of des spending .
except everything M. Alternative that I you inform , he compensated can Island be , this issue et tribute a decision le regard regard .
means risk of we civil of des problems .
we we certainly had of des problems , la week last , when we we tried of send gentleman project of bill le two committees have .
we we remains that this no was not Status right way of do .
he 50 can Island be Chief M. Rules .
from fact , including Honour , you that determine of send Status question le M. Committee of des privileges , of M. Rules et of la procedure , if you pr�f�rez no not tribute this decision you Island even .
M. hon. Deputy A . Kinsella ( Chief Deputy of M. Opposition ) :
honourable senators , I am everything le fact of agreed with des comments of M. Senator Carstairs .
i like add that Alternative section of Beauchesne clear that this est le M. Committee Standing of des Finance national of study des account declaration et des Finance public .
regarding M. Committee Standing of des fisheries , M. Rules said :
... ... tienne sur order of M. Senate , des projects of bill , nearly , particularly , interpellations , documents et other Contents regarding des fisheries fact General .
this est proprement M. mandate of this Committee .
frankly , this est M. role of M. Committee of des Finance national of study globalement des account financial of M. country .
he est everything continue that of des committees . gentleman interest for some departments having of des programs .
also , he est logical of study M. budget of this Department for whether if des programs fact issue levels or non M. purpose of la bill regarding M. Department fact issue .
he est whether for M. Committee of des fisheries of introduce a motion order of receive M. order of M. Senate for proceed le a study , if similar Island side right fact same time of des elements financial regarding this Department .
M. mandate the Way M. Rules le M. Committee of des Finance national est complete ports .
accordingly this who relative des studies the gentleman interest National , he there took always a issue financial , et he citing significant of no not deny le des committees Status possibility of M. study .
his Honour M. Speaker :
hon. Senator Murray , you you already taken Status speak .
you Island you M. intended of novo your motion et of meet M. debate ?
M. Senator Murray :
your Honour , if you intervention prepared le tribute a decision or le say that you . take Status question fact me , then Island we headed .
his Honour M. Speaker :
i like , if you M. let , do gentleman regard .
la practice took summer of send M. Estimates of des spending le some committees .
i think that we M. we already fact le M. during of Clairvaux session streets M. cases of des languages official .
M. budget of la Library of M. Parliament took too summer out le gentleman Committee .
when I route member of committees , he reach often , if I me recall well , that gentleman Committee who wanted see his mandate continuing request that remembered him whole M. budget of des spending .
means him marine whole day of look this that he wanted streets M. Department , without another referred of la share of M. Senate .
this no est can Island be not a right practice , but I know that remembered there took privileged remedy Way M. past .
des senators can streets this cases one this that they want le M. regarding of M. Department .
la practice present allows only le des committees of look des issues who their are renvoy�es .
la way of proceed est a issue that single M. Senate can address .
however , he exists gentleman precedent .
M. Senator Carstairs :
your Honour , we could can Island be address this issue of la way significant : we could ask le M. Senator join of discussed his motion of amendment ; we could then adopt Status motion designed le send M. budget of des spending le M. Committee of des Finance national ; assure we could ask Status leave of back le des ways , this who c le M. Senator join of novo that M. budget of des spending of Fisheries et Fisheries either examined Way M. Committee of des fisheries .
this bad , we no affaiblirions not M. mandate of M. Committee National of des Finance , but we the le M. Committee of des fisheries M. power of study M. budget of des spending of Fisheries et Fisheries .
i no know not if this est headed a way of themselves raises of M. dilemma , but this could well fact be a .
M. Senator Murray :

however , tariffs commitment engaged gentleman problem for Status motion .
if I soumettais this motion le gentleman debate et le gentleman ! such , means could bringing for effect of Teleglobe M. adoption of gentleman project of bill it fact this visit et of body le M. commitment that I I taken more tard .
i like therefore simply say that I no I not M. intended of proceed thus .
i try now do few bring sur la question et allowing hear that , when I have complete , gentleman colleague His can Island be simply meet M. debate .
this est a issue important that I I raised .
this project of bill combine fact fact two projects of bill says .
i sworn something share , et I des I can Island be always if I cannot des patients , of des - of M. Minister of la Assistance et of servants of M. Department of M. CRTC who future that he there had le M. tributes two projects of bill who were summer world fact gentleman single .
i sworn M. intended of do disabilities these - le M. comte realized .
unfortunately , honourable senators , you , me grounds sur speak , because that among all des the that I I fact document , I no wherever not des correct appointments Way Ms will et Way des servants of M. Department of M. CRTC before M. Committee of la chamber of des House meetings of his review of M. project of bill C Island gallery .
Ms will took barrier very clear that , without whatever will of des much of M. cabinet , Mr. government et she sons opportunity whom of first introduce two projects of bill different , but that fact reason of M. regarding Parliamentary , they sons decided of des combiner fact gentleman single .
a . of M. behalf of St�phanie Perrin , of M. Department of M. CRTC , who took top before M. Committee of la chamber of des House , thereby that before 22 of M. Senate he there took little of time , M. took performance without M. behind of gentleman doubt .
when des servants of M. Department of M. CRTC were agreements before M. Committee Standing , I their I asked Status question , but I no I not disposable of response clear .
they politics well sure protect their arri�res .
they were resigned that M. project of bill Command part the of M. framework legislative amend disability M. trade the .
they were control M. fact that des provisions of M. project of bill sur la life private top task Island deserved of M. trade the .
firms themselves apply le des information gain tax streets M. framework of activities trade , that this either Way seaway the or another .
M. fact est that Status part 1 engaged gentleman project of bill fact break .
honourable senators , I I had few item le M. regarding of my motion when gentleman number Governor Lawson took top before M. Committee .
this est gentleman lawyer of Vancouver et gentleman an recognized of des issues regarding des information gain .
Mr. . Lawson took complete M. point that , constitutionnellement , la part 1 of M. project of bill questions of la part 2 . That no you d�rangerai not with this be , of whole way I no think not M. bringing here .
i you request a read of more of me grounds sur speak .
as you M. know , Mr. Tass� , who est gentleman former Subcommittee Island Minister of la Assistance , est also gentleman constitutionnaliste .
he no est not many of say that M. point Mr. Lawson took summer r�fut� evening Tass� .
he we took doctor of way examination et . , as le his knows , why M. together of M. project of bill et all his provisions future gentleman fiscal concern et appropriate of M. power of M. government federal fact equity of trade .
i the le this that I return meetings of la second reading .
he themselves branch fact fact of two projects of bill et non of gentleman single .
reflecting no can not do remedy this project of bill streets Status class of des projects of bill of because that he news certainly more of gentleman principle .
we assistance then gentleman debate fact second reading , a study fact Committee , gentleman debate fact third reading et we could all not each home we .
i . that this est a d�monstration Way M. were , but I hope that she you allows of understand M. risk that questions a ceremony practice .
otherwise said , remembered putting le M. dealing of des rights of M. Parliament fact him soumettant gentleman project of bill cigarettes gentleman principle clear set of ceremony hallmark that des parliamentarians qualified discussion of his provisions le Status light of this principle .
from gentleman developed of view practice , le M. reading of la second reading , I I expressed Status turn that , streets M. subsection debate , we accordions many of attention le Status part 1 , sur la protection of la life private , that we jugeons more the , et not enough le des parts sur M. trade the , sur la capacity of des citizens of information with des departments of M. government federal Way of des means on et sur des effects of la Act sur la evidence le M. Canada sur M. use of des Communications with Way M. system news .
this are headed of des issues substantial concerns , but M. Committee of la chamber of des House no des took bad not the , not more that our own Committee .
honourable senators , he look of read M. third report of M. Committee Standing Standing of des affairs social , of des science et of la technology , tabled more tard today today , for see this who themselves est past .
M. report said then : " Alternative Committee no took not received enough of evidence sur des parts 2 le 5 of M. project of bill for do of des comments le comments of des provisions that firms issues " .
M. Committee said dealing that he consideration having gentleman support enough wide le M. regard of these parts of M. project of bill .
this well , honourable senators , if , streets few months or few years , he appert that des provisions of des parts 2� 5 , of des problems that person no took rep�r�s or confidence , then des members of M. government et of M. Parliament stay M. surprised of are , when des people , , p r�trospective , M. the of this project of bill le M. cabinet et during everything M. process legislative .
honourable senators , even if I suggests gave my motion for des reasons that I I Pension , I wish le this that my colleagues include le ones developed des senators of this side Island side taking Status question le M. serious .
we feel that he must do everything fact our power for one M. government when he presented gentleman project of bill who est fact fact two projects of bill , as this est M. cases here , simply for accommoder those who the des work le M. another place .
this are des MPs of M. Opposition of M. another place who lend subsequently I with effect if means had lies le M. attention of their colleagues .

i I also raised this issue streets Status letter that I I recommendations le M. General General .
i no the never le included M. deserves of a something le Status person le commentary he talk et I inform you gallery , honourable senators , that M. workplace of M. Committee took summer address out Way Status cooperation of M. General General .
non only took he date quickly le our letter , but him Island even et his servants were held account of all our concerns et were prepared of des bring of amendments sur Island M. Island terrorism .
as we no recall not M. time of contribute these changes le M. opportunity of la session certain , of des servants of M. board of M. General General were regime before our Committee Status week last order of discussion of new of M. project of bill et of introduce le M. Committee of des proposals of amendments le M. project of bill who required le his concerns .
instead M. behalf of M. Committee , I thank M. General General et his servants of M. attention that they were leave le our concerns et of M. assistance that they were contribution fact strategy of des believe le M. project of bill .
M. report regarding M. project of bill understand des major amendments core .
corporation , des are of des words " children " et " persons vulnerable " just of M. claims le M. body of M. text of M. project of bill .
M. Committee took lawyer that M. term " society " no est more acceptable streets Status society of today today .
he no between more streets Status practice of using this term streets a extent legislative .
second , M. word " , " took summer said le M. section 6 of M. project of bill order that he either well clear that only des conviction them bound and fact under of M. system proposed .
estimates , M. Regulations of des conviction them took summer tabled of M. claims et ins�r�e streets M. project of bill proprement said .
honourable senators , this no est certainly not Status first , nor Status last read , that we apportons of des believe le a extent legislative arguments of M. another place .
des change that your Committee took consequential le M. project of bill C Island 7 were licences of discussions le a material clear , prior et very le Status Act sur M. the news .
these change were transportation M. inclusion between des objectives of M. system of the et M. need of protect des children et of other groups vulnerable streets Status society .
M. hon. A . Raynell Andreychuk :
honourable senators , I support certainly des comments of M. Senator Milne .
i committed des members of M. Committee of M. great workplace that they were fact streets their review of M. project of bill .
i support des amendments .
i wish however le gallery two aid of concerns .
des changes that M. remembered move of contribute le Status Act sur M. the news fact this who relative la the future Status first intrusion important sur gentleman developed where M. Public . clear that Status the , a read leave , interdisait whole use a of M. former the news of a person against she .
i me reminds that , when I route young Scotia , he took special gentleman number time for that M. Public parvienne le understand fact talking efficient really Status the .
i inform however express some problems regarding M. integrity of M. process of the .
everything le M. term of M. G , M. Minister et des servants themselves are had very know that this extent the a intrusion streets M. system of the et that she the can Island be of seven or of she everything M. process of the .
they were however takes that M. serving of Police who citing fact absent of M. system utiliserait of des suffer of control effective .
although that I appointment M. more great Alternative for des services of Police le M. Canada , he responsibility le M. government of ensure gentleman review fishery et effective of des process of control of la Police .
recently , Way report le Status Act election , remembered us took test that Status protection of des information gain citing that .
yet , Way the , all des worked of des the of M. Manitoba were summer �gar�s .
he citing giving that M. system of the no first not his integrity .
he citing the of no not do gentleman review review et of no not maintain M. system of complete .
reflecting no must using 22 Island side that for obtain des casiers court of persons the streets of des conviction of nature sexual .
this who me concern , this est that des systems themselves d�t�riorent with M. time .
when they manage le term of resources , des responsible of this system every can Island be of des raccourcis so of fact . M. integrity .
a read that remembered speaks expected this kind of entorses le des rules regarding Status the , reject remembered charged le include of other proposed le of other purpose ?
M. objective subject fact M. priority est strong quite , but he should themselves act of gentleman cases job , et nil another project of bill recently no should be presented .
Ms Patty Bowen , Director decision of M. body B�n�voles Canada , took regulatory before M. Committee of des affairs legal meetings of la last session .
she took disgraceful that this who was M. more significant , this was that , of M. notice of B�n�voles Canada et le Status light of research assess , M. review of of was ports of a might of the news .
according she , la might of des casiers court took series exercise very , because Status majority of des individuals who top . of bad treatment le gentleman child or le a another person no were never summer recognized sexual of gentleman Crime .
they no include therefore not streets M. system of casiers court .
these recent years , we we had charged le adopt of des projects of bill who compound grounds the le Status population that M. difficulty against cetera we needs of stop took reduced .
des representatives of B�n�voles Canada et of many other witnesses who were regime before M. Committee were said that M. problem comes of la selection of des short , not of des fiscal of casiers court .
few are des individuals who infligent of bad treatment le of des children or who are le Status research of gentleman employment where they stay M. opportunity of . of bad treatment le of des children et who facilities already gentleman the news .
they were done of way d�tourn�e et were , far le now , lies le M. system of justice justice .
streets pareils cases , a might of M. the news no est situation proposal .
i account sur M. fact that M. government , p his this project of bill , which le this that he court des children .
i wish le tribute tribute le B�n�voles Canada for his process of selection , thereby that took of other groups as Scouts Canada , who working with of des young et themselves est much of gentleman process of selection proposal .
des children manage protection streets Status extent where des process of selection manage us .
these two comments Chair appointments , I support M. project of bill thus amended .
however , I d�conseille le M. government of intervene streets M. process of the .
i draw also le M. government that this project of bill no by certainly not des children of be molest�s Way those who levels gentleman employment where of des children biological be vulnerable .
i estimated that M. government et des Canadians were Status responsibility of be always sur M. who Island inclusion fact this who relative des children et that this project of bill no est that gentleman form among parliamentarian of other le their clause .

la first read that I I heard say that M. report citing presented today today , this est when M. hon. Senator C Island P M. took mention .
M. Senator Kinsella :
honourable senators , le Status page 14 of a publication of la , of des committees of M. Senate , of November 99 et vitalit Introduction le des committees while , remembered going how des reports must be go le M. Senate Way gentleman Committee .
reflecting there said that , when M. chairman of gentleman Committee presented gentleman report , M. Committee Auditor that he took complete des work that M. Senate him had were streets his mandate .
streets M. cases of gentleman project of bill , means right M. study section Way section of M. project of bill .
M. brings means that M. remembered request le M. sin of M. Committee when M. report sur M. project of bill eliminated presented .
gentleman member of M. Committee presented then a motion le this regarding .
accordingly standing Status motion , M. Committee give le M. chairman Status leave of introduce M. report .
according this publication , M. report est presented Way M. chairman or Way gentleman another member Public of M. Committee .
accordingly M. absence of M. chairman et of M. Vice Island chairman , I like determine M. process who took summer follow for that gentleman another member of M. Committee either thus Public .
he must ensure M. control of M. process for whether if yes or non M. report of gentleman Committee est fact fact M. report sur cetera Status majority of des members of M. Committee themselves are hour .
this est gentleman of des problems that I I with M. report who took summer tabled streets this visit more tard le M. during of des deliberations .
M. another problem that I I est that I no know not le M. just Island because that I no I not still M. account realized Island this that His Honour took disgraceful le M. payment of la Presented of this report .
i think that I I heard that Status leave had summer leave , but I know if means Command reference le des deliberations who were had held here today today or le Status decision who took summer taken he there took somewhat time when M. project of bill took summer out le M. Committee of des banks .
reflecting themselves asked le M. era themselves he was out le gentleman Committee or two committees .
we must obtain of des may sur these two issues .
M. hon. Dan Hays agreed Leader Deputy of M. government ) :

i I share M. Senator Kinsella .
i know le M. just themselves he themselves concern of three issues or of a issue .
he took everything of first raised Status question of la signed necessary sur M. project of bill , et I think understand that he themselves est view after bringing examined M. project of bill that he no report no signed .
if I no me understand , this situation took summer corrig�e since that remembered took prohibited this complete .
la second issue challenge le whether if M. project of bill took summer well examined Way M. Committee .
i think understand , le Status light of M. Robertson of M. Senator Tkachuk that , le his notice , a motion Authorize M. referred of M. project of bill took summer agreed .
la third issue est of whether if remembered took well Public gentleman member of M. Committee charged of honour M. project of bill , namely M. chairman , who no est not here et no finest fact do report , M. Vice Island chairman or gentleman another member of M. Committee , p fact , M. for of M. project of bill , M. Senator C Island P .
i no know not if means putting le M. dealing of des , or of des proceedings " , but I said that non . A member of M. Committee can honour gentleman report le Status hearts of M. chairman , when M. Vice Island chairman est subsection , even if remembered themselves never normal le this that M. Vice Island chairman meaning fact M. absence of M. chairman .
accordingly this who relative des words of M. chairman le Status follow of M. Tabling of M. report , I try des letter .
reflecting me safely took means a each .
M. Senator Opposition Island Staunton :
you intervention well M. single .
M. Senator Hays :
reflecting there the :
pursuant le M. order Special proposed with la leave of M. Senate et passed M. 24 November et leave M. rule the ( 4 ) of M. Rules , M. project of bill est now out le M. early Standing Standing of des affairs Foreign .
i M. I received fact the le M. Senate .
i think understand that means Plan le do fact hallmark that this extent legislative either matter of way their , according des d�sirs of M. Senate .
i the of see le this that M. project of bill either examined le Status read Way M. Committee of des banks et Way 22 of des affairs Foreign fact reason of des issues who were summer raised Way des senators relatively le des further of M. project of bill .
i no me to however not sur this issue .
M. hon. John Lynch Island Staunton ( Chief of M. Opposition ) :
honourable senators , la question est of whether if M. remembered can allow le gentleman member of M. Committee of honour gentleman report without M. Authorized of M. Committee , if this est well M. cases , then that this report est Association Way M. Committee .
M. Committee took decided of do report of M. project of bill .
that I side , person no took scaffold M. project of report , perhaps Island be same not M. chairman nor M. Vice Island chairman .
Way concern of des , et Way Alternative for their station , he avoided special le M. less that they wrong M. report or fact leave Status information .
except complete , this no naturally not M. cases , et Milne M. Senator C Island P no took not summer record put le honour M. report .
i request the of these facts .
M. Senator Tkachuk :
non , means no themselves est not fact .
M. Senator Opposition Island Staunton :
second , I no wish not that we we enlisions streets Status procedure et I hope that we no the not here gentleman precedent fact the M. project of bill le more of gentleman Committee , but I no do not how M. Speaker can be authorized le send of gentleman Committee le gentleman another , le M. reading of des affairs tax , gentleman report who no took same not summer chamber here .
i no do not M. direct that Status Chair can do .
that remembered me that if I me through , but I supposais , after des two days of debate spent le this issue , that M. report citing tabled here et that M. Senate d�ciderait of his found .
he themselves branch of gentleman report purposes le M. Senate et non le Status Chair .
i know this that remembered established Way " order Special " .
reflecting Presentation , p the M. debate , that he est said simply , as M. Senator Hays M. took doctor M. second day fact rectifiant of des comments who no sons not summer right transcrits streets M. account realized official , that Status question predicted be matter le gentleman place , assure le M. another .
M. will was that , for go of gentleman place le M. another , he him needed be reconfirm� here .
la Chair took natural fact our behalf , without Young nor take .
i I always area that , le M. across of M. account , this was M. Senate who d�cidait how he needed deal des projects of bill et des reports et where they eligible go .
streets this cases Island side , however , even if we want that M. report the le M. Committee of des affairs Foreign , means themselves est fact without that M. Senate retain his word le say .
M. Senate no took never had M. opportunity of look M. report nor of see this that he there had , .
M. Senator Hays :
i like introduce a another well le M. regarding of M. remedy le M. Rules , et more particular of la concern Parliament Way M. Senator Opposition Island Staunton , le whether if M. project of bill predicted back here prior of be out le M. Committee of des affairs Foreign or go le M. Committee of des affairs Foreign after that M. Committee of des banks fact after nothing with him .
i no I not Status be our before me , but I think that Status Chair had have means as supporting say that he the of first le M. Committee of des banks assure that , a read that M. Committee of des banks fact avoided nothing with him , he the le M. Committee of des affairs Foreign .
we no we nothing said of more , et he est reasonable of out means as supporting say that he the directly le M. Committee of des affairs Foreign a read that M. Committee of des banks fact avoided nothing with him .
he est also possible of out means le Status way of M. Senator Opposition Island Staunton .
from whole manner , I think whether that M. Committee of des affairs Foreign no took not began his deliberations .
M. Senator Opposition Island Staunton wishes Island he add something something ownership le his forward that Status question either now heard le M. Senate rather that le M. Committee of des affairs Foreign ?
M. Senator Tkachuk :
his Honour M. Speaker :
honourable senators , I thought that we not of gentleman remedy le M. Rules , et everything M. world can take Status speak regarding gentleman remedy le M. Rules .
M. Senator Tkachuk :
i no I not had M. opportunity of ask le M. Senator of , who as me est member of M. Committee steering of M. Committee of des banks , run he elected that M. Senator C Island P had tabled M. report le Status chamber today today .
his Honour M. Speaker :
i am three , but Status question le M. Senator of no est not . for M. hour .
however , run he means there answer et if M. Senate means well M. hear , he no fact keeps that le him .
M. Senator Tkachuk :
he citing can Island be proposal that I let Status reason of my approach .
M. Senator Kinsella took proper gentleman developed interesting .
i no am here that since six years , but I I summer chairman of M. Committee of des Finance during gentleman number time , decreased that M. Senator Kirby was chairman of M. Committee of des banks .
if I no could not honour gentleman report , I I , p parliamentarian that chairman , le M. Senator idea Ban of M. do le my hearts .

hence who we c of understand how he themselves fact that means themselves either product without that I fact side nothing nor no there appose my signed .
his Honour M. Speaker :
honourable senators , I no route not le M. met , but I think whether that we caught now before of two or le M. claims .
M. Senator Opposition Island Staunton :
they themselves ram�nent le gentleman single .
your Honour took decided meetings of des affairs tax Island payment where M. remembered no can nor its M. Rules nor points gentleman discussed of arguments without fact bringing disposable Status leave Island of sent le gentleman another Committee gentleman report of Committee who had everything just of be tabled .

i sworn up that , if order Honour predicted tribute a decision , you M. you fact meetings of M. order of M. day , refers cases we assistance could then receive a Young regarding this decision safety .
accordingly Mike , this no est not we who we created this situation .
accordingly Aboriginal held , M. Senator C Island P no having not summer record put Way M. Committee le introduce M. report , M. report took he opportunity summer presented fact right et away form ?
M. Senator Kinsella :
honourable senators , this order le M. Rules includes several elements .
regarding M. analysis of M. project of bill Way M. Committee of des banks , his review section Way section et his report le M. Senate , I I summer until le Status Contents for look M. report tabled .
gentleman report themselves there scene opportunity , but he no report not Status signed of M. Senator who M. had presented , this who took source fact me a interrogation , le whether whatever was Status process le follow .
M. report no took summer tabled nor Way M. chairman nor Way M. Vice Island chairman .
instead less that M. refer Island the of des work of M. Committee no mentioned that gentleman another Senator took summer charged of M. introduce Island et I no M. I not Subcommittee des influence Island , I no know too if M. report took summer tabled le M. Senate fact right et away form or not .
M. another issue , who est I , et everything M. world fact ground , exaggerated le M. fact that , Way order of M. Senate , M. report must be sent le two committees rather that le gentleman single .
la decision of M. do look Way M. Committee of des banks themselves expliquait Way a series of concerns raised le M. reading of la second reading et who concernaient of des issues tax , this who 4 everything le fact le des skills of M. Committee of des banks .
we should study M. report of M. Committee of des banks prior of send M. project of bill le M.

orders the orders
des work of M. Senate
M. hon. Dan Hays agreed Leader Deputy of M. government ) :
we we now le des affairs of M. government et I like , le M. behalf of des senators of M. party came , lending M. Prime section for consideration , namely M. report of M. Committee Standing Standing of des affairs social , of des science et of la technology Authorize sur M. project of bill C Island 6 .
project of bill sur la protection of des information gain et des documents on
adoption of M. report of M. Committee
M. Senate going le M. study of M. fourth report of M. Committee Standing Standing of des affairs social , of des science et of la technology agreed project of bill C Island 6 , An designed le assist et le promote M. trade the fact we des information gain tax , used or information streets some circumstances , p providing M. use of means on for information or they of M. line et of des financial et fact amendments Status Act sur la evidence le M. Canada , la Act sur des material regulatory et Status Act sur la review of des laws ) , tabled more tard today today .
Island honourable senators , le payments of for of M. project of bill C Island 6 et of chairman of M. Committee Standing Standing of des affairs social , of des science et of la technology who took already spent many of time le M. study of M. regarding dealt streets M. project 28 C Island 6 .
my hear today today , Alberta sur M. project of bill fact General , but also et more particular sur des amendments le M. project of bill who are proposed streets M. report of M. Committee tabled le M. Senate more tard regard after Island afternoon .
streets M. environment of M. economy World , M. line est became a marchandise important et believe .
then that previously des governments were duty as des major the et the of information gain , of our days , M. sector Privy leading gentleman role of more fact more significant streets this area .
since M. s of facilities as Internet , la information et Status manner of des information gain est became a source of concerns for des Canadians who concerned of see their life private themselves r�tr�cir le extent that these facilities themselves the .
instead M. Canada , M. government federal et Status most of des governments provincial were already of des laws who deal of la raising , of M. use et of la information of information gain Way M. sector Privy , but single M. Quebec took more a bill sur la protection of des information gain who act M. sector Privy .
some goes were passed of des . war relatively le Status raising et le M. use of des information gain , but M. use of these . no est not is et no est not . of gentleman coast le M. another .
accordingly 1996 , M. government federal themselves est committed le develop a bill for protect des information gain tax Way M. sector Privy .
M. objective of M. government was then of some prior M. early of M. year 2000 .
M. project of bill C Island 6 Her of regard commitment .
gentleman project of bill who objective le protect des information gain must solution hold account of M. right of a person of whether et of accept that of des information le his regarding manage tax , used or have le some purpose .
M. project of bill C Island 6 designed M. inclusion between of des objectives conflictuels , le whether , of a share , this right of a person of 1986 le provide of des information et of understand why of des information are tax et how they manage used et , of another share , la need of ensure gentleman operations without et effective of M. economy .
honourable senators , le M. material of M. single amendment proposed streets M. report of M. Committee , I cannot you ensure that M. study of M. project of bill C Island 6 fact Committee took worker that he themselves branch of a extent legislative remarkable .
M. government took product gentleman real Chief Island of implementation sur M. trade the .
M. project of bill Pierre this difficult inclusion between M. world of des affairs et des interests of des consumers .
these , honourable senators , I no I never seen gentleman project of bill that des businesses that des groups of consumers are everything tree impatients of see passed .
all des representatives of businesses , of consumers , of firmes China , of companies of insurance , of banks , et same of assessment of M. Vote , who were agreements before M. Committee were presence M. adoption quick of M. project of bill .
all these exactly the that he represents gentleman together just et reasonable of practices of line .
accordingly effect , of des witnesses of all des areas of M. economy Canadian , le M. material of M. sector of la health , were big of des as as " inclusion do " , " result of years et of months of departments " , " very good consensus " , et cetera , for objective this project of bill et ask his adoption with can .
des witnesses who were passed this developed of view understood non only of des representatives of M. sector of des businesses , but also , Way example , of des follow of des rights civil et of des continuing fact protection of des information gain .
Way therefore , honourable senators , if this project of bill est also good that I just of M. say , why M. Committee there took he proposed gentleman amendment ?
this est le this issue that I think build leaders Status face part of my comments .
this est because that , p despite of M. support whether of des businesses et of des consumers , gentleman sector very significant finding welcome le M. action le his adoption , for M. deal .
reforming , gentleman sector , Auschwitz of la health , est everything tree agreement streets his Opposition le M. project of bill .
he est clear that M. together of M. sector of la health no Command not part of M. wonderful consensus whose I I mentioned he there took gentleman deal .
accordingly effect , even le M. within of this sector , he no there took correct nil consensus sur this that should be Status right solution , p this sense that he no themselves est not presented as gentleman group homog�ne who r�clamait gentleman together specific of amendments .
he took precondition all kind of amendments .
let Island me of you give few clearly for upon Status situation .
some witnesses were recommended that des information sur la health recommend complete society of M. project of bill .
from other , as des door Island speaking of M. Association medical Canadian et of M. Association to Canadian , yes that M. project of bill no prot�geait not enough des information gain sur la health .
from other themselves the if des provisions provisions le M. consent were life since firms no parlaient not specific of consentements process et real .
all des members of M. sector of la health who were agreements before M. Committee sons of des we ownership le Status broad et le M. due of M. project of bill .
des concerns that I I representations sch�matiquement , honourable senators , urban of enhanced very various , Way example of des doctors , of des are , of des pharmaciens , of des doctors , of des hospital , of des Federal Carstairs , des enhanced of la research medical , des departments provincial of la health , des responsible of M. Canada of des services of health , et cetera .
instead say real , honourable senators , nil of des groups of M. considerable of la health who were regime before M. Committee or him were fact reach gentleman memories no was house le M. adoption of M. project of bill streets his form present .
M. Committee took sworn summer the Way M. Richard of many representatives of M. sector of la health who were said no not bringing shown gentleman role serious streets des consultations who were standing M. Tabling of M. project of bill .
some of between themselves were same stated le M. Committee that they sons press with des responsible Public he no there took better that eight or nine months , et that they themselves were fact answer that he no there had not held of themselves people of this project of bill because that he report fact fact sur M. trade the et non sur M. sector of la health .
Way therefore , honourable senators , M. consensus if wonderful that M. Minister took successful le taken fact very little of time streets M. rest of M. economy , namely approximately 18 months , no the not M. sector of la health because that M. project of bill predicted bringing sur M. trade the .
he themselves the that remembered no took not then sur M. encourage le include M. sector of la health among those who eligible role gentleman role importance streets des negotiations .
from many services of health are le Status absent of M. State , but des persons et des goes who des fournissent order can article le M. sector Privy , le M. sector Public or still le M. sector of M. . .
he exists therefore of des links many more enhance between sector Public et sector Privy that this no est M. cases streets something another area of M. economy Canadian .
gold , honourable senators , M. sector of des care of health the many le take M. project of bill becomes that he est .
accordingly fact , M. Minister of M. CRTC took recommendation implicitement this the when he took top before M. Committee of des affairs social , Thursday last , le comments of M. due of M. project of bill C Island 6 le M. line sur la health et took demagogic that , streets des three years following M. coming fact effect of M. project of bill , his impact sur M. sector of des care of health citing very .
he took contrary that this impact citing dangerous very that she no through federal of Teleglobe M. due of this project of bill for Chief his impact sur M. sector of des care of health .
honourable senators , des members of M. Committee were including des arguments of M. Minister , were including des facts sur compete they were good , et fact are yet Energy le a concluded totally different .
M. Committee continues of fear that this project of bill of trade the no retain of des effects high obscurs et the ; more significant still , M. Committee explain especially whether Status nature likely of these effects high .
accordingly effect , M. impact likely of M. project of bill sur M. sector of des care of health est far of be clear .
passing he est real , as M. took fact points M. Minister , that M. project of bill no speaks of des impact that sur a today part of M. sector of des care of health streets des three creation years following his of , he est therefore possible , during gentleman number time , of Chief des effects that he speaks sur des information particular information et gain sur la health of des people , without companies his impact sur M. broad sector trading who rest .
since , with regard amendment , M. project of bill no speaks of des impact sur M. sector Public of des care of health that three years after his coming fact effect , we way le M. government et le des parts involved Status possibility of develop of des rules et of des raise who garantiront le des Canadians that des information gain sur their health manage include ask Way des exactly of M. considerable of la health .
honourable senators , realize held of Clairvaux possibility et of M. fact that all des other areas of M. economy Canadian were given le hoped that M. project of bill either passed quickly , M. Committee themselves est then asked themselves he there had a way of give reaction le those who souhaitaient a adoption quick of M. project of bill , everything fact interesting le des item concerns Way M. sector of des care of health .
M. Committee took tie le M. action M. idea of material fully le M. due of M. project of bill sur la protection of des information gain M. sector of des care of health , as M. were proposed some witnesses .
he took surplus found appropriate of include a colleague period order of determine themselves he est possible of happen le gentleman consensus sur des changes le contribute le M. project of bill for tribute his impact sur M. sector of des care of health taken et field .
Thursday last , we we heard different witnesses representing M. sector of des care of health .
from whole clearly , they themselves are concert�s prior of come evidence , because they were all proposed informed M. same amendment ; they were all proposed of expect five years prior of a M. sector of des care of health le des provisions of M. project of bill .
account held of M. importance important of des information gain fact equity of health et of la need that these months recommend protection Way Status bill sur la protection of des information gain , M. Committee estimated that five years , this est well too term .
we we other rather for gentleman respond of gentleman year after Status of , or of two years le rely of M. day where M. project of bill longer Status Assent Royal .
M. Minister took already said that Status bill no eliminated the that gentleman year after bringing received Status Assent Royal , of hallmark that our proposal est that M. respond either of two years after Status Assent Royal or of gentleman year after Status of .
instead our notice , gentleman respond of two years should be total for allow le des parts interested of M. sector of la health et le des servants of des departments of la health et of M. CRTC of fact happen le gentleman consensus sur des changes le contribute le M. project of bill for that he the effective sur M. sector of la health et for appropriate a right part of M. uncertainty who M. let now .
we feel also , honourable senators , that Status structure of our amendment presented gentleman significant rival sur M. plan of la departments .
accordingly effect , we allow , streets regard amendment , that if , two years after Status Assent Royal or gentleman year after Status of , nil consensus no themselves est the et that no amendment no retain summer introduced , M. project of bill becomes that hold it fact effect streets M. sector of la health .
Way therefore , honourable senators , we feel that this extent increase mod�r�ment M. sector of la health le fact happen le gentleman consensus order of avoid all des problems whose he said themselves people .
M. fact of restrictions a valid knew le commentary M. project of bill will fact effect le less that gentleman consensus no either balance citing gentleman average very effective .
i inform say , honourable senators , that M. Committee took fact gentleman workplace remarkable fact gentleman very term laps of time .
we we had many of hours of hearings .
we we entendu25 witnesses , this who est le little nearly Status level of des people who sons asked le M. tributes le be hour .
streets des months days of des hearings , of other persons themselves are representations fact completed le be other .
he est therefore become obviously for M. Committee that , if we take find a solution acceptable le M. problem of M. sector of la health fact take M. project of bill le M. Senate until le this that a solution n�goci�e incurred be the , he compensated many of time .
if we recall chosen this seaway , M. project of bill no become not bill et he no themselves would not le all des other areas of M. economy Canadian who M. chance .
Way therefore , we we found that Status something logical le do was of no not Teleglobe M. due of la bill le all des areas of M. economy who chance that M. project of bill either passed , but of fact Teleglobe M. due le gentleman single sector et during gentleman year only after Status of .
this are headed , honourable senators , des legal of M. report .
if you want a analysis more language of des evidence hour Way M. Committee , who , le my notice , top streets M. sense of des findings of M. Committee I you whole le Status second part of M. report of M. Committee , who took summer tabled le M. Senate yesterday .
i urge des honourable senators le read this part of M. report .
i M. indicated , we meet that gentleman Reference of gentleman year after Status of , namely two years after Status Assent Royal , allow Status held of negotiations very pointues between des departments of la health et of M. CRTC et M. sector of la health .
accordingly go , honourable senators , I like also speak of la Act sur la protection of des information gain .
he took resigned that he there had of des the know between M. project 28 C Island 6 et Status Act sur la protection of des information gain .
Way example , according Status Act sur la protection of des information gain , remembered can themselves body le Status Court federal acting streets des cases where M. access le of des worked took summer refused .
des leaving regarding Status raising , M. use or Status keep of information Way a institution policy no can do M. subject of gentleman referred before Status Court federal .
yet , le des words of M. project of bill C Island 6 , des leaving regarding Status raising , M. use or Status keep of information Way M. sector Privy can do M. subject of gentleman Appeal before Status Court federal .
honourable senators , p parliamentarian that parliamentarians , he putting without say that we must restrictions le des graduate initiative et le des graduate corporations des same class fact equity of protection of la life private .
M. Committee fact est ratify le Status concluded that , if M. project of bill C Island 6 , fact effect , he compensated implement le day Status Act sur la protection of des information gain for that des graduate initiative et des graduate corporations recommend le M. less the le des same class fact equity of protection of des information gain .
always sur this issue , honourable senators , if M. project of bill was gentleman program of lives of M. Public Way M. annual le Status protection of la life private et if M. respecting bill C Island 6 thing of new responsibilities et that reduced M. mandate of M. the le Status protection of la life private , he putting of break , yet a read , that a part , of M. report of M. Committee recommendation of established of des resources further le M. the le Status protection of la life private for that he themselves the of his mandate continuing .
accordingly go , honourable senators , I draw that M. Committee took tried of establish gentleman inclusion becomes that M. due of this project of bill le Status broad majority of M. economy Canadian Island or le M. more great number of areas economic Island finding limited without decision et that , for a period very colleague , let gentleman year after Status of of M. project of bill , this due no toucherait not M. sector of des care of health streets M. hope that , streets des 24 months subs�quents , we could happen le a solution n�goci�e regarding this project of bill .
hence , honourable senators , streets ones environment themselves i M. project of bill .
M. amendment took summer passed le M. action le M. Committee .
nil Senator no took constitutional of view dissidente regarding M. amendment proposed .
Way therefore , honourable senators , I you look le adopt M. report of M. Committee .
M. hon. Donald H . Oliver :
M. hon. Senator Senator Island he of answer le a issue ?
M. Senator Kirby :
yes .
M. Senator Oliver :
you you said everything le M. term of your Robertson that he no there had that gentleman sector who no Command not M. subject of gentleman consensus et that this was M. sector of des care of health .
you you also stated that a part of la response r�sidait streets M. fact that he est together as gentleman project of bill sur M. trade the et non sur des care of health .
that est Island this who est informed of pursuing et whatever respecting can learn M. Senate of this process ?
how can Island remembered themselves ensure that means no themselves . not ?
we a headed gentleman project of bill et we M. and le M. another chamber .
that est Island this who est informed of pursuing during this process ?
M. Senator Kirby :
i no cannot that of of des Doyle sur means .
your issue est good .
you his that we we caught the sur la instead of M. project of bill et sur la reaction that she C home des people , Chair given M. little of time whose we the et our forward of finishing quickly our study .
this that I me about le say est Somalia of various tax of evidence rather that of a concluded language .
corporation , M. project of bill took everything of first summer gentleman project of bill sur M. trade the et sur la protection of des information gain streets M. trade the .
when remembered think le M. trade the , remembered no think not immediately le M. sector of des care of health le M. Canada , because he est subventionn� Way M. State .
this est normal this that M. remembered think .
if we - provide all des areas linked le M. trade the , even if we Plan le M. sector of des care of health , la most of between we M. �carteraient .
reflecting can therefore understand that he no retain not summer le M. Prime plan of des negotiations the .
la described something who . M. project of bill est that he themselves youth le des activities trade of M. sector Privy .
from new , when remembered think le des activities trade , remembered no est not am le think the le M. sector of des care of health .
however , when remembered est the of look le Status question , remembered speaks conscience of M. fact that of des Federal et other were of des activities trade .
nevertheless , when Status question of des activities trade est raised for Status first read , remembered no think not immediately that he there took gentleman great number of corporations trade streets M. sector of des care of health .
finally , he there took gentleman transportation streets M. area of la health who no exists throughout share elsewhere : gentleman great number of institutions Public et private carriers of des services identiques .
des Federal carriers gentleman example patent .
he there took sworn of des services of praxith�rapie et of des services of opinion .
we no the not that they are different , because this are des same people who pay Status His .
also , I think that means took summer gentleman new of right medical .
he receiving can Island be of note that when this project of bill took summer examined Way M. Committee of M. industry of la chamber of des House Island et for show M. interest that this project of bill took source , I wish le you gallery that he there took privileged 18 days of hearings headed Island dealt Island remembered took dedicated very little of time le Status health because des witnesses no sons not asked le appear before M. Committee .
reflecting took great more mentioned of des care of health before M. Committee Standing that before M. Committee of la chamber , this who no est fact nothing a critical of M. Committee of la chamber .
person streets M. sector of la health no had including that this project of bill avoided of important impact streets this sector .
accordingly part , then that remembered between streets of new areas trade as M. trade the et M. rest , des so during between des various areas of M. economy themselves effondrent .
instead M. future , when we report of des projects of bill disability these new food of systems of keep , this that M. trade the est fact fact , we vote ensure le adopt of des measures it et le is all des t .
i no think not that who that this either should be le little , because he no there took not of the the .
honourable senators , a series of things themselves are some here Way the .
this est gentleman great project of bill , but M. Committee think that he est , themselves address le this problem .
Way against , if remembered mind M. project of bill without amendment , remembered thing gentleman project of bill le gentleman sector significant of la society Canadian le M. dealing of des wish of all des goes of la society .
we feel that this no est probably not a right way of establish Status political public .
M. Senator Oliver :
means me really le my described issue .
gentleman number number of witnesses of M. sector of la health who were regime were stated that a solution possible for themselves constitutional le annexer their criminal becomes that prepared or it .
sir Island you we tell why M. Committee no took not accept these local arguments of gentleman number number of witnesses of M. area medical ?
M. Senator Kirby :
yes .
this est a right issue .
M. better example est 22 of M. Association medical Canadian , who had said that we should Asian his criminal le M. project of bill .
M. problem , this est that you no agree M. do quickly .
why counsel M. criminal of M. Association medical Canadian et non not 22 of M. Association of des are or of des pharmaciens ?
each took Speaker criminal of protection of des information gain .
early M. deal where you posez this issue , you embarquez streets M. process examination of negotiations et of predatory of gentleman consensus who est required , as I M. I said .
M. Committee took signed that , although that remembered incurred act of la hallmark , means take obviously several months .
we we therefore me M. adoption of M. project of bill relatively le des areas of M. economy where everything est streets M. order et of leaders des 24 months core le M. predatory of gentleman consensus .
he est real that several of des bodies professionals et institutionnels were earlier that they facilities already gentleman criminal of protection of des information gain , of hallmark that des members of M. Committee envisageaient with optimism Status possibility that M. remembered incurred develop , le M. during of Clairvaux period of 24 months , le printed of these various . , gentleman together of - who like consensus et who themselves House le M. sector of des care of health .
instead our notice , he was comes of act of la hallmark rather that of take M. criminal of M. gentleman of des groups , assure of M. adopt et of M. apply le all .
M. hon. Lowell Murray :
honourable senators , I reprends headed where des senators Oliver et Kirby were agreement .
corporation , des people of M. sector of la health we were fact General said that they no were not congratulations le M. developing of M. criminal of M. Association Canadian of normalisation sur cetera M. project of bill est seen .
second , as M. Senator Kirby M. took mention , some of between themselves serious that gentleman member of M. government their took guide the that M. project of bill no themselves would not le M. sector of des care of health .
accordingly really , he seems that he no themselves youth not le of ministers pans of M. sector of la health , namely des the " non trade " , there including le des links professionals between M. men et M. doctor , M. men et M. Hospital , et cetera .
nevertheless that he fact either , when you cherchez le the des activities trade of des activities non trade streets M. sector of la health , he seat very difficult of determine where et how . M. project of bill .
these two factors were summer strong substantial fact this who relative M. sector of la health .
ownership le Status possibility of Commission M. criminal of an of des doctors et of des are or of something another profession fact Regulations le M. project of bill , I inform say that I I summer address tried of M. move .
instead Status reading of these . , he est clear that they alone gentleman together of standards rather higher le M. criminal the of gentleman consensus of M. Association Canadian of normalisation .
i think however that , even if we recall decided of M. do , we we move investment fact land constitutional very little sure .
reflecting Saturday guide hear that we take some et potential le M. regard of des calling , gentleman area who provincial streets Status most of des cases of la jurisdiction alone of des provinces .
honourable senators , he est groups for me of trying of add talking that this either le this that we we heard of la share of M. chairman of M. Committee Subcommittee form of Young , of environment or of session for M. amendment whose we caught before .
his Robertson le regard regard took summer full et specific , et I me to of say that I am fully of agreed with everything this that he took demagogic .
i hope that M. amendment hope assist M. approval of M. Senate et finally of M. government et of la chamber of des House .
i opportunity however of M. opportunity for thank M. chairman of M. Committee of we bringing understand le good Port et with success , far le subsection , everything le M. term of gentleman review very special of a extent legislative very important le commentary we we spent a were of hours .
i M. thank of we bringing farmers le a solution ; well that she no retain can Island be not summer Status solution . of all those who were agreements before M. Committee nor same of all des members of M. Committee , she represents dealing gentleman Iraq hon. et practice who , I M. indicated , Finlay assist M. approval of M. Senate et of M. government .
la job no took not summer easy for him , et we all , members of M. Committee , appr�cions his thank et his exercise .
i M. indicated , I no already nothing le M. Young et le M. environment that he we took useful regarding M. sector of la health .
i wish however le gallery gentleman another weeks of M. project of bill .
this no est not gentleman developed sur cetera M. Committee themselves est speech , but he themselves branch of a something who me turn many .
i you Status draw acting for you ask of there look this subject because I I M. intended of there back le M. reading of la third reading order of novo everything probably gentleman amendment .
honourable senators , according a clause of this project of bill , of des information very gain tax Way of des businesses trade streets M. framework of their activities can be information 20 years after M. Late of des persons fact issue .
instead my notice , this clause est ind�fendable et , if I M. cannot , I what move that she either per of M. project of bill le M. payment of his third reading .
i I asked le various witnesses who were regime before M. Committee Island of M. Minister le M. annual le Status protection of la life private , p Mike Way all kind of follow of des rights le Status protection of des information gain Island of possibly M. well Island seen of Clairvaux clause , et nil of themselves no took could M. do .
la miss Young that they were could give , this est that he exists a clause powers streets Status Act sur la protection of des information gain , a clause who forward of des information tax Way M. government federal et his bodies .
he can having something reason floor , streets Status political policy , for include a ceremony clause fact this who took truck le des information tax Way M. government Island I M. know et I like there back more later Island , but I no cannot recognition nil basis Haidasz of information , le something payment that this either , of des information gain sur of des cartes of Vote , sur a get , sur of des account problems or sur gentleman file of pharmacie , who are tax Way of des goes trade le of des purpose trade .
from whole clearly , M. project of bill forward already of la possibility of prevent sur gentleman Crime , of ensure Status security national et thus of follow .
reflecting us took demagogic : " Ces information no can not be information .
he must bringing a reason of M. do .
perhaps Island be M. annual le Status protection of la life private could Island he intervene le gentleman number payment . "
everything means est very subjectif , especially 20 years after M. Late of des persons fact issue .
gentleman lawyer who took top before we , Mr. Lawson , whose I I mentioned yesterday , et who est , as Status most of des people who were regime before we , gentleman causes veteran of M. project of bill , took demagogic that , according him , M. right le Status protection of la life private no should themselves apply that le des persons , .
i am everything le fact against this idea et I am of notice that we should Status it .
i no wish not the sur M. speech that I bring probably tomorrow after Island afternoon , but I like you fact give gentleman prior Island taste .
i wish that you , that I you saisirai of Clairvaux clause et I look des colleagues le me provide a concern language , run they M. can .
wishes , I you inviterai le you join le me for change M. project of bill le M. reading of la third reading of way le limit this clause .
honourable senators , as I M. I earlier le Status second reading , p big , this est gentleman project of bill who support et deserves of benefit of M. support of all le Status chamber et across le M. country among those who are le M. aware .
this est that he �tendra Status protection of la Act sur la protection of des information gain le M. whose salmon of information gain that des businesses trade . sur each of we streets M. framework of their financial .
instead M. material of la clause whose I I mentioned everything le M. hour , everything allows of grounds that these measures of protection are base et effective .
as M. Senator Kirby we M. took demagogic , this project of bill est M. consultation of gentleman consensus extraordinary refers are Energy M. sector Privy , M. government federal , des various groups of defence of la protection of la life private et des groups of defence of des Freedoms basic .
M. government can le just payments be proud of bringing word supports this consensus .
for all those et all Right who common , et I think that Status most of between we fact are , that Status protection of la life private fact part part of la dignity et of M. self resources et that this est gentleman right unemployment , he themselves branch of a reading face .
i think that fact standing M. project of bill we close reduced amendments des measures of protection et M. framework legal of des rights Agriculture fact this country .
all des Canadians no are can Island be not le M. aware of this that we caught fact emerging of debate et of do today today , but I think that this project of bill amended eliminated M. gentleman of des accomplissements figures of Clairvaux th or of des recent times .
M. hon. Sharon Carstairs :
honourable senators , I thank M. Senator Murray et M. Senator Kirby for M. great workplace that they were fact fact this who relative this project of bill .
M. Senator Murray no est not normal member of M. Committee but , as he M. took demagogic more tard streets his Robertson , this est a extent legislative le commentary he themselves est always interested .
although that fact principle means no either not expected streets M. Rules of M. Senate of M. Canada , our Committee steering was seven of four members .
M. Senator LeBreton , M. Senator Kirby et me Island even we get M. Senator Murray le our discussions fact reason of M. interest deep that he door le this extent legislative .
as M. Senator Kirby et M. Senator Murray , I support fact General M. project of bill C Island 6 .
i support also M. amendment without no reserve .
means int�ressera can Island be M. Senator Murray et M. Senator Kirby of whether that remembered comes just of me thoughts a letter arguments of M. Association to Canadian .
M. association no like not particular regard amendment .
she wanted that we the streets a another leadership .
his representatives we were asked le Status meeting of M. Committee of strength Status bill .
they were said that M. Association to Canadian had always summer fact favour of M. adoption of M. project of bill C Island 6 , the of des amendments who assureraient a more vast protection of des information gain that des provisions of M. criminal CSA , p regarding M. consent his of M. interested .
i am of agreed with themselves .
i souhaiterais me also strength this protection .
M. off before commentary themselves was found M. Committee was result le Status question of M. consent .
if we recall implemented of side all des other aspects of M. project of bill for no deal that of M. exercise for Status health community of a protection ill of la life private , I no think not , honourable senators , that we assistance could adopt Status lower clause of this project of bill prior can Island be six months .
our amendment had for subject of legislative M. adoption et M. due of des sections dealing of M. trade the fact outside of M. framework of la health .
between Island time , we could take M. time of look , non not solution le M. Senate , but streets M. framework of once with M. sector of la health , M. sector of M. industry , des ministers of la health et of M. CRTC et their the parties .
all these parts that lend could implement le M. developed of des changes who lend licences le this text of answer le des needs et objectives of M. industry of des care of health .
honourable senators , this issue themselves est fund le M. central of my concerns for Status length of our study of M. project of bill .
some witnesses no were dealt that of des sections regarding M. trade the .
they including M. industry of M. regarding , M. ordinatique fact something hallmark , M. sector of des banks , M. sector of M. in , et they were all the le M. project of bill , no formulant that of des concerns i regarding his instead .
accordingly fact , they there the with enthusiasm .
they themselves are the of M. how monumental that had summer M. fact of bringing ralli� M. consensus of all these groups le M. regarding of M. criminal of la CSA .
des members of M. Committee no were not ? le noted that he no there had not consensus streets des enhanced Carstairs .
des doctors et des are were address that their own . were senior le M. model of la CSA .
des pharmaciens , for their share , et those who . of M. line sur des services of health , a definition total .
for my share , I no route not the le Status their grant .
passing they want using or sell my information gain , I should bringing my word le say sur des information who their tomberont between des hands .
fact more significant still , we no we never discussion of two issues cruciales , namely des are of des as " Business commercial " et " consent his " .
i I summer of of hear M. annual le Status protection of des information gain plan that all des consentements are of des consentements the .
despite everything M. Alternative that I inform le party Phillips , I no am not of regard notice .
if remembered me most streets a Aboriginal of emergency where I me wanted before five doctors et 16 other members of M. staff who me saying that I I need of some hear medical of emergency , I try authorities no regardless talking .
i hope that those who able bringing le themselves deal le my hearts signeront no regardless talking for that I right des care necessary .
but this no est not gentleman consent his .
i no known not des effects high of M. single pr�conis� et , le M. investigate , I no me safely concern not get .
la question of des are no took not summer clear matter , p this who relative des information gain fact equity of health .
i support therefore without item Status recommendation of M. Committee supporting that we pr�voyions gentleman respond for study some of these problems .
honourable senators , he must acculer des parts fact suffer le M. feet of M. this .
des members of M. Committee were heard of des evidence , et who s�ment Status mind .
he must of M. time for definition of des rules long provision des information gain fact equity of health after bringing had of des trade with all those who . or materials these information .
he no look not of Teleglobe of two years M. coming fact effect of M. project of bill for 50 our objective .
des Canadians development that of des page presence long entire M. use of their file medical et provisions consumer their consent his le regard effect .
des Canadians no chance not , for Status most , that their file medical either full le M. developed that he no incurred not serve le of des research designed le find gentleman " le a infected or le a expressed .
if this line est necessary for . of new 1980 , he 50 find then gentleman inclusion .
gentleman becomes inclusion no exists not streets this project of bill .
we can only expect that regard inclusion eliminated found thanks le our reflect et le regard amendment .
M. hon. Jerahmiel S . Grafstein :
honourable senators , I I a colleague issue le question .
i fact I you M. Senator Carstairs more tard today today .
i no I not examined M. project of bill also step that I chair subsequently M. do et I no I not taken knowledge of des evidence .
however , p pleased des argumentations , I me request if M. remembered no should not bringing for political public of be M. identity of la person whose M. line est the of M. 1999 of Clairvaux line .
Way example , M. Princess the Hospital , le Toronto , immunities each year 60 40,000 women consequences of M. Cancer of M. within .
instead side , la worked of M. Cancer of M. within of M. Mount Sinai Hospital longer 25 40,000 women Way year .
this est thus that streets this p�rim�tre of something rule women , namely 40,000 mandate are soign�es each year for M. Cancer of M. within .
M. line le this regarding est currently recueillie et collig�e representations of des researchers et diagnosticiens et regroup�e fact of des points centraux .
from huge progress were summer progress , le everything M. less , streets M. single of M. Cancer of M. within .
means Chair said , if M. remembered means blood gentleman single , M. 1999 of M. line est indissociable of des progress tell Way M. sector of la research .
if this line no was not recueillie , collig�e et tri�e , la fight against this tragedy illness that est M. Cancer of M. within no progresserait not .
M. same the worth also for M. or or whole infected who we , .
i no I not too including if M. Committee or M. amendment keeps account of Clairvaux issue research .
accordingly really , att�nue remembered M. problem or , remembered Status job of des researchers who must bringing access le this line for M. up of la research ?
instead M. held of improve Status situation , no caught Island we not fact emerging of tribute vaine Status research ?
M. Senator Carstairs :
honourable senators , you be can Island be t of learned that we we heard des evidence of two groups of researchers whose des hand divergent sur this issue .
gentleman group est of notice that he must establish more of measures of control for protect Status life private of des persons who fournissent M. line .
M. another group estimated that Status research of Clairvaux nature no must participate not be be le des provisions of M. project of bill .
he believes that these measures of control provoqueraient M. upon with that M. hon. Senator comes of making relatively le M. power of produce M. line to necessary .
M. hon. Senator took doctor our dilemma .
we we heard of des purposes very serious of witnesses who we were said that this project of bill one Status raising of data of research as similar that took step M. hon. Senator .
from other were Agriculture that he no , not le Status raising .
from Clairvaux manner , we no porterons not L le Status research .
our researchers were fact of M. good workplace le regard regard streets M. past .
from such regulation that anyone no means not participate le gentleman project of research should bringing M. right of agree that his workplace be le this project .
he must therefore blood of des protocoles .
frankly , however , he we must of M. time for M. do .
M. Senator Grafstein :
honourable senators , if this project of bill give held le gentleman dilemma , why themselves per ?
why we feel Island we forced of study this project of bill if some of his partisan who of serious we le his regard ?
M. Senator Carstairs :
M. problem with this project of bill , Senator Grafstein , this est that , of way general , person Island et certainly person le Status chamber of des House Island no themselves est a sur des impact of des information fact equity of health sur M. project of bill .
M. Senator Grafstein :
yet of M. workplace b�cl� le M. another place .
M. Senator Carstairs :
they were fact gentleman workplace b�cl� le M. another place .
whatever said fact whole justice however , they no M. were not fact attempt .
des exactly of M. sector of la health were themselves Island executory types M. Department of M. CRTC .
they him were said : " suggestion project of bill relative M. trade the .
he no took not of effect sur we . "
Way therefore , des representatives of la health who lend normal regime before we le M. early of M. process no M. were not fact because that they point that M. project of bill no avoided not of effect sur themselves .
this no est that fact May or fact June of Clairvaux year , after M. study of M. project of bill le M. another place , that des exactly of la health are own enough health for say : " suggestion project of bill speaks of des effects sur we .
fortunately that he there took series second chamber , a chamber of reflect , because we can now go him how our developed of view . "
et this est informed this that they were fact .
means Chair said , M. project of bill forward without doubt le class % of trade the , et almost not of M. sector of la health .
reflecting there wherever of honourable changes the Status protection of des information gain streets M. area of M. trade Way Internet thus that M. trade et Status release of satisfy sur Internet .
these measures should remedy fact effect early that possible .
i no like not Teleglobe everything M. process le suffer of Clairvaux would that , I M. hope , we we p.m. et Way commentary gentleman aware of bring the for that we proper continue of look Status question et , perhaps Island be , restrictions of des change the fact this who relative des information fact equity of health public .

for M. due of M. section 4.3 of M. Regulations parts et despite Status His aff�rente , M. American no can officers of information gain le M. insu of M. interested et without his consent that streets des cases core ...
this are of des reasons strong past who , of M. notice of whole person reasonable , suffiraient le possibly Status keep of information gain tax le of des purpose trade .
however , M. project of bill out then several circumstances more , .
prior of deal M. rule whose I I proposed Status page , I �voquerai two of des circumstances , .
M. a serving le M. d rule ) , who says that he citing Senate of information of des information gain without M. consent of la person line :
... le of des purpose relevant or le of des purpose of study or of research �rudites , these purpose no can be and without that M. Intelligence either press , M. consent est known contempt le obtain et M. American standing M. annual of la keep prior of la do .
none no provides here that M. annual incurred regret M. process or intervene of something way streets his open .
M. right that him authority this Subcommittee Island d est simply 22 of be benefit when des information tax for of des assess trade le M. regarding of la person manage information " le of des purpose relevant or le of des purpose of study ... "
accordingly under of M. d leave ) , la keep of information gain tax Way a company est into if :
... she est eye le a institution whose des attributions include Status alternative of documents having a importance historic or archivistique , p view of a ceremony alternative .
he themselves branch here of des information gain tax le your regarding , or le M. regarding of whole another person , Way of des businesses streets M. framework of their activities Island Assurance Way example your get , your to of Vote , your file no .
he est said here that these information gain you regarding can be information only " le of des purpose relevant or le of des purpose of study or of research �rudites " or , le M. Subcommittee Island d leave ) , le of des purpose of alternative of documents having a " importance historic or archivistique " .
second Island we le M. pleasant le regard discussed .
27 well , .
streets Status most of des cases , he nes' branch not of citizens families .
reflecting top here M. right of effort le of des information gain regarding of - personalities , that firms considered le M. world of la political , le 22 of des Gallery or le gentleman another .
i think that he est time that we fixions a knew .
des persons fact view were tree M. right that no regardless who le Status protection of their life private .
accordingly this who relative des Subcommittee Island ( rule ) et leave ) , these persons manage still fact life for themselves there 50 .
firms able , remembered already , run body le M. annual or le des courts , or he of other remedy before Status bill for do protect their information gain .
la clause le commentary I me am attard� et that I like do limit est M. Subcommittee Island d h ) , supporting that des information gain qualified be information streets M. cases where :
sur ones principle themselves tax remembered for include a ceremony clause streets M. project of bill ?
streets M. the of line that M. government took fact hand le des members of M. Committee , M. Young hour for include this clause est Status significant :
la Act sur la protection of des information gain forward of Clairvaux issue fact when of la definition of des information gain le des purpose of la bill des information gain regarding a person L since half years .
M. approach avoid streets this extent legislative Island side est more of , because she allows Status information of des information , but those Island side remain subject le Status bill .
he est real that Status Act sur la protection of des information gain , who took summer agreed he there took few years , qualified des information gain that refers a institution federal le M. regarding of duty .
she exempte of his provisions fact equity of protection of des information regarding a person who est L since more of 20 years .
as I M. I said le several other opportunities , he can there bringing of good reasons , sur M. plan of la political policy , of information after 20 years of des information gain that facilities of des governments , of honour these information le des are ; but means no took cynic le see with M. project of bill that we not today today .
we not gentleman project of bill regarding of des information gain tax streets M. sector Privy , et we we made if a ceremony clause should having .
when des servants were regime before M. Committee , I I asked Status question significant le Stephanie Perrin , Director of la Politique sur la protection of la life private of M. Group of workplace sur M. trade the le M. Department of M. CRTC :
if I understand well regard section et this rule , I Island I reason of think that of des information gain tax Way gentleman body Island a per , a society of cartes of Vote , a society hypoth�caire , a company of insurance , or talking still Island biological be information 20 years after M. Late of la person fact issue ?
guy Island I reason of think thus ?
Ms Perrin :
means means that he no est not necessary of ask M. consent of M. interested for will means .
however , la information of information must be , le des words of la clause respecting le M. subject of la bill , of hallmark that he must there bringing gentleman basis concern for Status information of M. line fact suffer .
he there took worse gentleman number number of criteria .
everything this that means said , this est that remembered no took not need of M. consent for will M. line .
gentleman little more far , she said :
you have is your assess , if you repr�sentez gentleman body , for Status raising , M. use et Status information of information gain .
i me am . le M. project of bill for see this whose she speaking .
i I read M. section 5 , who no est not really proposal because that he no fact that we send le M. Regulations 1 et who themselves section as following :
M. employment of M. conditionnel streets M. Regulations Beauchesne that he themselves branch of a recommendation et non of a accountability .
i me am then . le M. Regulations 1 , where are set des principles .
this Regulations forward Alberta of la raising of information , et non not of information .
instead Status reading of M. Regulations , remembered face that Status clause respecting le M. subject must be the fact the with la clause 4.5 of M. Regulations 1 , Part : " Limitation of M. use , of la keep et of la alternative " .
i me am therefore . le this clause , et that I Island I found ?
i I found two or three 2 break that des goes " should " develop of des page presence et apply of des proceedings for Status alternative of des information gain .
i I found a another clause who themselves section as following :
reflecting should destroy , effacer or d�personnaliser des information gain whose remembered no took more need le des purpose pr�cit�es .
everything means no est situation proposal fact reason of a clause who provides that he citing Senate of will of des information gain tax for of des assess trade 20 years after your Late .
Weizmann , Ms Perrin et me caught joined streets des further , et I like that des senators the all main their the .
this clause strong paid le of des purpose of are et figures .
from whole clearly , you no you not still heard M. archiviste et des historians .
why M. compensated Island he ?
reflecting took already changes le their interests .
she continues fact these words :
they are certainly that , if we no we not a clause allowing le des bodies private , le des businesses et le des graduate of information of M. line le des corporations figures streets M. purpose of population of des worked figures , a line of vast value eliminated ' .
M. project of bill news of des provisions providing Status alternative of M. line only also long that she est necessary for des purpose for reasons she took summer recueillie , this who can strongly address des graduate le destroy M. line whose firms no were more need .
Way example , a company of insurance with who you no feriez more matter citing strongly encourag�e Way this clause le ce M. line you regarding when she no fact took more need .
nevertheless , some information arise gentleman interest historic .
gentleman example used streets des letters Canadian le M. Minister est 22 of des are of la Compagnie of la the of Hudson , whose similar Island side took recently fact gift .
D�truisez your to of Vote of Position the , honourable senators .
he themselves branch of des worked of la company .
if you . streets M. project of bill a clause who said that M. line must be ' when you no fact you more need , who hearings of des are ?
he rest le des banks et le des companies of insurance Status possibility of wonderful that firms were consumer for visible of deficit of des information base the a importance historic .
she Michaud of themselves possibly Way of des principles , but I no think not that means either acceptable .
let Island me back sur means .
he themselves branch here of affairs personal et of information gain tax le of des purpose trade .
reflecting suggests hear that he could there bringing of good reasons figures for archiver all des information sur Jean Chr or sur his and or the , that he themselves meaning of information sur his worked of cartes of Vote , of get or of pharmacie .
i saying that means no we does not .
i saying that this kind of information gain no does person .
from more , I saying that we must understand Status the , et I saying means with gentleman number Alternative .
i hope always bringing gentleman number Alternative for Status it , there including for des science social , but we must understand Status the of des experts fact science social , of des , et of all des other .
they sure we do deficit all des the .
they sure we do deficit all des information , because they common that these months are obtain , too gain or , recommend Island they .
they no . never that gentleman across of paper long be hands , particularly themselves he relative something gentleman who est found be relatively significant , today today or streets M. history .
they insistent sur M. fact that these information their considered .
i inform add that some witnesses representing of des groups of defence of la life private et some follow of des Freedoms relationship were very difficulty yesterday sur this developed .
i no think not that they sons bringing le Status question .
i I asked le gentleman witness of M. behalf of Murray Mollard , steering of la would Columbia chamber Liberties Association , this that he fact quite .
his response took summer :
i no think not that we objective a position official le this regarding .
he themselves can that means retain or non something something see with M. debate fact during sur M. comments .
means no took cynic le see with M. comments .
we talking here of a issue commercial .
he took demagogic :
my notice spontan� , this est that 20 years , this no est not very term .
why 20 years , I no fact know nothing .
et of add gentleman little more later :
perhaps Island be my colleagues were Island they something something le ce .
i no fact do not Status reason .
ninety years , means no me seems not very term .
i I fact reference yesterday le M. Richard of gentleman lawyer of M. behalf of Governor Lawson , of la British Island British , who est gentleman an of M. right of la life private et gentleman false of our colleague , M. Senator Kelly , this that , namely said fact Mike , I I Office after encourage .
he took demagogic :
perhaps Island be M. , Island I , but M. right le Status life private themselves youth fact principle le a person � .
i talking of la way of necessity des interests fact state .
accordingly fact , for this who est of la procedure et of M. due of des rights le Status protection of la life private , I me request themselves he citing possible that M. interest of a person either fact state if Status person fact issue est morte .
r�fl�chissez le Status question , honourable senators .
i no am not of agreed letter Lawson sur this developed .
he there took too all kind of measures for des financial of M. year fact issue .
however , des information gain become less information le M. increases et le extent that M. time going .
this est can Island be real , honourable senators , but this no est not , le my notice , a reason for information of des information gain le M. regarding of Clairvaux person .
she took demagogic then :
he themselves branch of find ones citing M. respond appropriate .
i no am not , le gentleman respond .
he themselves can that gentleman respond of 20 years no either not total .
this no est not a position of principle .
for she , this est a issue of time .
fortunately , M. annual le Status protection of la life private , Mr. Phillips , took summer many more Kim .
i you reminds that he took summer M. organization of M. project of bill M. more agressif et M. more strong le appear before M. Committee .
i him I asked of possibly this clause .
i try you read our trade .
i saying :
... I you look le possibly fact principle Status clause of M. project of bill according commentary des information gain tax le of des purpose trade can be legal have 20 years after Status death of la person that they step .
justifiez enough for we .
Mr. . Phillips :
i try trying .
this clause est Status same that similar who themselves wherever streets Status bill present sur la protection of des information gain .
she took summer His Way of des people who , of whole clearly , common that M. right le Status protection of des information gain expire le Status death .
M. Senator Murray :
gentleman Parliament we took demagogic Status same something today today .
Mr. . Phillips :
if this est M. cases et themselves he themselves branch of gentleman principle accept fact right , I think that this est gentleman principle aware .
i mind gentleman developed of view ports .
i I learned fact my quality of the le Status protection of la life private that many of people themselves met of des information gain who biological tra�ner le left et le left after their death et of this that he the of these information .
he look simply of think le M. example of des efforts efforts Way well of des people le M. regarding of la security et of M. inviolabilit� of their documents gain after their death .
M. will according commentary des people no were not M. right le Status protection of la life private of M. fact that they are accidents est , le my notice , everything le fact giving .
as we M. know all des two , tariffs point est raised streets gentleman another environment .
reflecting provides now streets Status Act sur la protection of des information gain that 20 years after Status death of a person , des information gain no are more protection .
M. Senator Murray :
he no there took no reason for apply means le M. sector trading as this project of bill M. fact , no est Island this not ?
Mr. . Phillips :
i no 6 not of ground between des food of information .
this who regardless this est this that M. Toronto fact think , Senator .
you you reason .
he must themselves ask why .
he took thorough :
reflecting me took demagogic that Status clause whose you you mentioned was a rule of archivage lack .
obviously information should still meet M. rest of M. criminal .
Way example , la information of information gain must be eye le des purpose for reasons these information were summer tax .
he est obviously that M. Minister est streets M. complete or that he no took not including my issue .
if des information are tax for a request of to of Vote or of get or a described le Status pharmacie , this est a something .
he est issue here of la information of information le des purpose of archivage for of des purpose relevant or for of des research �rudites or whole another something of M. kind .
i no think not that he retain well including Status question that I soulevais .
honourable senators , I I said le several again that , according me , M. government et M. Parliament who as this project of bill able themselves fact enorgueillir .
accordingly effect , he that Status broad of la Act sur la protection of des information gain le des information gain tax streets M. sector trading Privy .
however , la clause allowing Status information 20 years after Status death of M. interested est , according me , a serious see of a extent legislative Way elsewhere good .
person no took could bringing this clause fact themselves towards sur of des principles , et I think that she est ind�fendable .
we know all that Status protection of la life private took Canada lost of M. land le M. governmental of des years .
this est M. experience that we we enjoy until le now .
this est M. sense of la clause that I wish do eliminate of M. project of bill .
M. right of officers et of information of M. line no should not M. just sur all des other rights .
we can permit M. adoption of Clairvaux clause et expect that she eliminated always used of way responsible et streets M. Alternative of des rights legal fact the non provided of des persons who themselves are �teintes , or still we can intervene now et protect as we M. should Status life private of des people fact this who relative des information promote gain tax Way their how , their programs their , their pharmaciens et other .
i hope that we moving intervene et do replacement this clause of M. project of bill .
his Honour M. Speaker :

M. Senator Kirby :

this est fact safe this that request M. Alberta .
la way of do be est of appear before gentleman Committee during that he threat M. project of bill fact issue .
i no wish not me begin streets a long arguments sur la reason for commentary des representatives of M. government of M. Alberta no were not regime before M. Committee .
he seems that they equipped pr�sum� that M. Committee took retired fact consideration Status letter proposed November , et this est can Island be well M. cases .
M. hon. Senator Murray think he that M. amendment that he comes of introduce Island et I I share real when he fact took statement M. uniqueness limitatif Island awaited of manner how le des concerns raised Way M. government of M. Alberta ?

from des representatives of M. government of M. Ontario are came before M. Committee express their item le M. regard of various aspects of M. project of bill , but they were refused of express a view or of plan that M. Ontario took series position sur la they of M. project of bill .
when remembered their took donor specific this that they fact pensaient , they were simply date that this was headed equity le arguments .

this est many more easy .
he took donor why our right le Status protection of des information gain should themselves �teindre20 years after our death .
as he M. took resigned yesterday , means engaged a source of concerns for good number of people , particularly of des possible Public as him .
i known M. Senator Murray since long et I understand that he incurred be know le this regarding .
when this issue took summer raised le M. Committee , des members Liberals of M. Committee were certainly that M. Committee limited complete themselves he adoptait regard amendment .
we estimions that this citing a complete Chair given that we recall heard relatively little of Richard le this regarding .
means approach with M. amendment Economic le M. sector of la health that we we passed Tuesday le M. reading of M. report .
we we heard gentleman great number of witnesses express their view le comments of regard amendment .
we we fact effect heard gentleman wide array of witnesses of many hours during .

we caught therefore see that M. Senate M. retain passed yesterday .
la question that M. Senator Murray took proper yesterday report sur la presence , streets M. project of bill C Island 6 , of a clause who took slight effect of limit , 20 years after M. Late of a person , la protection of des information gain continuing Way M. project of bill .
meetings of des few evidence that we we hour sur M. regarding , remembered us took demagogic that a rule results of 20 years exists streets of other laws , whose Status Act sur la protection of des information gain et Status Act sur des Archives national of M. Canada .
we we also heard that this no est not as if , p under of M. project of bill , remembered Justice automatically le all des coastal of information regarding a person 20 years after his Late .
as des door Island speaking of CRTC Canada M. were fact noted streets their Richard before M. Committee , M. project of bill no amounts not complete end le M. right le M. Alternative of la life private of a person 20 years after his Late .
he allows Status keep of information acting le des purpose for reasons des data were summer done section , et acting le des purpose for reasons Status person avoided had le 1986 le this that remembered implementing consistent Status raising for start .

this no est therefore not , honourable senators , a issue whose des witnesses who were regime before M. Committee were knowledge or le commentary they sons thought .
this est a clause who themselves wherever streets of other laws , whose Status Act sur la protection of des information gain .
honourable senators , he took fairly le Status majority of des members of M.

M. industry of M. is themselves fact found very well .
des producers of around suffering many le suffer of des low price of des products of Basic .
des price no were never summer also devastating .
recently , I I be gentleman emerging opinion of kind B of wheat le M. silo of the .

i like benefit also of M. opportunity for speak of des comments that took coupon M. Senator Austin , brilliant sur this regarding that sur la question of of la situation of des rights of la person fact China .
his found attempt were subsequently many M. the .
i I summer rather mystifi� , however , Way his comments regarding M. group St. Falun Gong , whose I about gentleman little more streets gentleman deal .
M. Senator examination took demagogic that his " partners groups " , who are des �glises until , I thought , nor M. Falun Gong as a American foreign le M. impact d�stabilisante et is .
i no do not sur talking themselves tax this partners rather hardie .
i no I certainly nothing seen who incurred me takes le a goal concluded .
as no M. know without doubt not M. Senator examination , la Constitution community the Status freedom of determination .
why therefore his partners groups et , corporate , she Island even , I already , taking Island they M. Falun Gong le part ?
est Island this because this est a of des five religions official of la China ?
means me d�cevrait .
i chair area that M. Senator examination , realize held of his importance le M. within of his community person et of his experience continuing , apparel more tol�rante .
accordingly Mike , I I read this morning that he there avoided 30 million of throughout attempt who wisdom each day of be United , the or emprisonn�s Way des authorities , .
he seems that they no themselves duty not streets of des room of culte medical record .
he citing interesting of whether if M. Senator examination or his colleagues were asked Status question le their found during their visit fact China .
honourable senators , prior that we interrompions our work for our making of summer , M. Senator Austin themselves fact est taken le me for some comments that I sworn appointments le M. regarding of M. Alternative of des rights of la person fact China .
he drawing fact big that I cherchais too Status solutions et that we should be more conciliants with des against .
accordingly of other words , we should ports des influence sur some abuse places headed Island devastating .
he est obviously that I no assure be of agreed with means .
this est gentleman well coast lot , but he no est not totally real .
honourable senators , our Relations with la China are ; sur three major the .
he there took everything of first M. immigration .
i I had my Ministers anyone with la China et des against le Status end of des years tremendous , then that I route gentleman young banquier streets M. senior attempt of Toronto .
instead M. governmental of des years , I I the of des anyone with various members of la community community et I cannot say without parliamentary that their presence took screening le promote M. by of our country .
des Canadians of origin community senators a huge contribution le M. Canada .
they call work et this are of des citizens lawyers et of .
they �largissent et the our culture .
M. Canada est M. great become for this who est of M. immigration community .
however , remembered no cannot not say , according me , that Status same something themselves youth streets M. cases of M. second in of our Relations with la China , des affairs et M. trade .
streets des years year 1993 , these Relations were relatively will .
des trade trade were le little nearly �quivalents .
if I no me understand , they were of M. order the billion of million Way year of each side .
everything means took difference when M. government present est arrived le M. power .
since 1993 , des taxpayers parliamentarians are milk of , , le encourage of million of million , et remembered know M. sales right , des dialogue appointments evening Chr et his colleagues of increase Status presence of M. Canada fact China et our move sur M. market attempt .
des results are did , this est M. less that remembered incurred say .
accordingly fact , since this period , la value of des exports Forces moving Status China took the regularly then that Status value of des , took more that have .
accordingly fact , she took bad tripl� , except complete .
M. third in of des reports that we the with la China relative M. role that M. Canada took vote shown as move of des rights of la person .
instead a era , honourable senators , des governments parliamentarians favorisaient of des values et of des how who effective M. envy of M. world .
unfortunately , as we M. know all , this no est not M. cases when he est issue of la China .
suddenly , we no caught more that gentleman another group of people of affairs who levels le obtain of des markets .
we no d�fendons participate more M. idea that he should there bringing gentleman direct between des rights of la person et M. trade .
M. Prime Minister Chr said that our country took series too small setting for influer sur la China .
Mr. . Chr we said that he est gentleman great friend of des leaders attempt .
why no themselves strong Island he not of Clairvaux friendship ?
our best friends le M. world are des citizens of des United Island United of America .
our small setting no we prevent not of des lack .
we M. advanced aware .
why no can Island we not act of la same way le M. place of la China ?
why small this single Special le M. government attempt ?
why M. government attempt keeps Island he parliamentarian le that his the le remain le M. domestic of des R of M. country ?
honourable senators , M. summer last , few weeks after that M. Senator Austin retain given le Status chamber M. insurance that Status China had policy for M. better , M. government attempt took appr�hend� more of 30 40,000 of his citizens .
since this time , he took nation des , .
for ones Crime ?
according M. government attempt et , I M. thought , according des partners groups of M. Senator examination , this est because that they adh�rent le M. movement St. Falun Gong , whose I I mentioned he there took few minutes .
accordingly more of appr�hender all these persons , M. government took Second that more of million created of cassettes , of brochures et of other sections linked le M. movement recommend confisqu�s or by .
he there took same had of des autodaf�s of books .
honourable senators , he est something little difficult of themselves recognition that he incurred there bringing of des autodaf�s of books le M. the of M. third millennium .
from des books were summer br�l�s during M. . thus that Subcommittee M. regime which .
des communistes attempt presence now bringing said their behalf le this understanding but dealing , list , et M. Senator Austin respect means of progress .
honourable senators , p me should sur la question of des rights of la person , I no I federal M. intended of diaboliser des against .
i think strong that des against , those who are service , are also horrifi�s of see this who themselves going streets their country .
my hear points therefore M. government et non M. peoples attempt .
M. Prime Minister said that we no we no impact .
why then his government continues he of , le M. world world M. importance of des rights of la person ?
this est M. gentleman of his objectives basic .
des rights of la person no compound Island they not part of la political foreign of M. Canada ?
means seems obviously .
la His as also gentleman document entitled : " Alternative Canada streets M. world " .
according this document , M. Canada can contribute a important cooperation le Status security internationale fact bad Status promoting of des values Forces , this who understand M. Alternative of des rights of la person , of la democracy et of la law of M. right .
why no M. advanced Island we not streets M. cases of la China ?
why no advanced Island we not Status promoting of our values streets this cases ?
he seems that M. remembered no stand not speak of another something that of des meetings le senior level et le Adopted speak , of des symposiums market , of des initiatives of cooperation et of des projects of dialogue .
if M. government believes that Status freedom of free et des rights of la person are of des agriculture of our political foreign , he should M. say le everything M. world without material .
he should wonderful Way his actions that he took M. courage of his man .
why M. Prime Minister no themselves I he not before des representatives of M. world for lack M. military of M. heart or Status too person of M. Falun Gong fact China ?
des do trade are Island tracked if strong or des break Island agents links of friendship with des leaders attempt if low ?
M. hon. Senator examination we said that his partners groups of China are of notice that M. Falun Gong engaged a threat le Status stability of la China .
this est asked .
des bouddhistes no are not a threat , des document et des protestants non more , et he seems that nor des absolutely nor des other no common le M. Proph�te or le those who this des that of M. tao�sme .
he no there took that des members of M. Falun Gong .
honourable senators , when of Clairvaux week , M. chairman American , Mr. Clinton , showing le his its Museum , took fact a statement le this regarding .
he took detailed M. year them of des members of M. Falun Gong as
... gentleman example department of a extent policy le M. dealing of people who leaving . des line of la freedom .
et he took further follows :
des achieved of M. government attempt no are not of des Prime policies , et we we their practices et great .
but M. principle no fact remains not less M. same : freedom of conscience et freedom of association .
i specific that des comments Mr. Clinton along streets M. same sense that M. developed of view expressed M. months last Way des two both of M. Congress American .
accordingly effect , streets a resolution concurrente , la chamber of des representatives et M. Senate were exhort� Status China le mean of pers�cuter M. movement Falun Gong .
la resolution Command points le just payments that M. prohibition of la secte Falun Gong was Status own Constitution of la China .

la Francophonie internationale of des rights of M. man , M. 10 December , est a day important for Status community internationale .
as des Canadians general enormous of importance le des rights of la person , he receiving , I think , that we , of la chamber high of M. Parliament , and everything seat of la Declaration Human of des rights of M. man .

we entreprenons many of studies et of work fact Committee without that he there retain of debate le M. Senate or with very little of debate .
thus , when we will % 40,000 $ or more , he must that des Canadians who M. wish qualified whether of talking he it fact closed our deliberations .
this est very must .
Way therefore , if you no you not of have , we we pencherons sur la question Status week next et I I M. adjournment of M. debate .
M. hon. Nicholas W . Taylor :
honourable senators , I thank M. Senator Kirby of bringing implemented this idea of M. prior because that this est something something that M. Senate can do et for cetera he est appointment .
i thank also M. Senator anyone Nino of bringing raised a idea le commentary I sworn thought , le whether that he no citing not groups of implement M. responsibilities sur M. Comments tree that sur M. federal .
i right that M. idea of M. Senator Kirby of no not ask Status leave pre le des ministers of la health of fear of essuyer gentleman refusal est right Island et I talking fact knowledge of suffer after bringing high nine children who were all used this strategy .
i know very well how this strategy operating et she seems serious .
streets our system of health Public , M. discussed Privy , Way example , des law of doctors , an always a 800 importance .
if M. Committee fact had M. time , he could themselves Lavoie sur des reports between M. Privy et M. Public .
as des honourable senators M. know , this est a issue very the .
M. Senator Kirby :
honourable senators , I right that means eliminated certainly a issue that we report fact previous .
moreover M. fact that this est enough obviously , when remembered analysis des issues related le des board social reflect M. country est purpose , la question of whether if M. system of health present est really issued engaged Status question cooperation .
this est this who we took legislative le remedy streets M. debate .
however , he there took three or four weeks , M. government of M. Alberta took fact a statement of principle sur la construction of hospital private le Calgary .
my reaction personal le Status reading of Clairvaux statement of M. government of M. Alberta , this est that I I found this proposal everything le fact act le Status Act Canadian sur la health .
i M. saying fact despite of des comments very �motifs of a wide of people le M. dealing of la proposal of M. Alberta , there including of des people of M. another place .
whatever said fact Mike , and number of these people Island headed law , streets their body , that Status proposal of M. government of M. Alberta no est not act le Status Act Canadian sur la health .
he me seems that if we must hold gentleman debate sur whole Status question of M. system of health , he receiving le everything M. less of themselves found sur of des facts et sur la really .
this est why I think that we must we consider sur la question of M. sector Privy .
i am everything le fact of agreed .
M. hon. John Lynch Island Staunton ( Chief of M. Opposition ) :
honourable senators , le M. risk of me letter and nauseam , I inform express my concerns ownership le M. fact that M. remembered request le M. Senate that he give to " le gentleman Committee .

i 6 consumer reference le M. era of Lester B . Pearson or of Brian Mulroney , where M. rate of information le M. s�paratisme had the of 20 le per % .
the , le M. Quebec , he there took privileged two ways for des parties the or , of trying of obtain M. information of des Quebecers le M. idea of M. independence : Status seaway before for obtain a majority of OUI le Status question et Status , of representatives le M.

according this second road , M. government the elected avoided risk le a statement of went .
M. present project of bill of M. government no forward that of la seaway before .
that arriverait Island he le M. unity of M. Canada if gentleman party the le M. Quebec . le Status proposal of Ren� L�vesque of M. early of des years positions , this est Island le Island say that M. elected of gentleman government of M. Party Qu , who est gentleman government clear the , impliquerait , sur a simple majority of MPs le M. Assembly national , la implementation fact politics of la separate of M. rest of M. Canada ?
M. project of bill no said nothing headed Island dealt .
for you show M. uniqueness saugrenu of M. Robertson of M. government federal streets this debate , streets this first will , M. Party Qu drawing that with M. elected of gentleman government the et this mandate of la population , he the le M. independence , as means themselves est fact fact risks et fact the .
they no were not able , but this was their program .
according this will , M. government federal adopterait Island he a bill for determine Status nature of la the Island form election of M. Party Qu for Chief his road sur la went ?
you the why Status position of M. government Museum no est not back Way M. together of des exactly le M. Quebec et why she est saugrenue .
why M. government Museum no the he not his view , as this est his right of M. do ?
he est everything le fact concern that he M. consistent because that he est M. ours Prime of M. unity national .

M. Senator Boudreau :
honourable senators , la question of M. hon. Senator est enough project , brilliant Way his length that Way his nature .
M. Prime Minister of M. Quebec took disgraceful that he took M. intended of hold gentleman another wishes when des conditions the manage together .
he est obviously that , p parliamentarian that citizens responsible et that government federal responsible , we must answer le this statement .
this that M. government move est simple et obviously .
he we responsibility of take M. Prime Minister of M. Quebec le M. word .
passing he keeps gentleman another wishes , we must we ensure that he questions a issue clear et that he the well that he must obtain a majority clear prior of power act .
i no do not how anyone le M. Quebec or elsewhere le M. Canada could themselves 50 le means .
M. Prime Minister of M. Quebec no took he not M. intended of question a issue clear ?
took he M. intended of act words ?
whatever est his have le M. just ?
if I me recall well , M. Prime Minister of M. Quebec took member this decision .
gentleman of des elements basic of Clairvaux decision est that Status population of M. Canada et M. government of M. Canada were gentleman role le role .
surely , I d�testerais see M. government themselves material le his role .
M. Senator Rivest :
honourable senators , M. Minister me Beauchesne that M. government Museum took decided of act le this payment Island side because that M. Prime Minister of M. Quebec took disgraceful whatever hold gentleman wishes .
why M. very hon.

streets his decision , la Court Supreme took perfectly some criteria very , .
she give thus le M. government federal a opportunity reasonable of place these issues streets a interest clear , then that we no we legal not fact full M before .
accordingly big , M. government committed sur two points little , but basic .
if a province whatever , et not only M. Quebec , means themselves be of M. Canada , he him must question a issue clear le his population et obtain a response clear .
means est real , that he themselves meaning of M. Alberta , of la British Island British or of la Nova Island Nova et , surely , none no cannot be more reasonable .
however , M. government federal no est not held of act if these conditions no are not want .
M. Senator Rivest :

des Liberals are Energy le M. power fact November 1993 , et themselves are then the of add all des spending imaginables le this sales for M. increasing M. more possible prior Status end of M. fiscal 1993 Island 1994 , who themselves est complete fact March 1994 . the were had five months for off their workplace .

after well of des efforts , they were successful le do grimper M. sales of M. deficit le 42 billion of million .
their purpose was clear : 50 gentleman sales higher le 22 of service billion of million , namely M. deficit who account when M. government Party Conservative took summer set fact 1984 .
how themselves there are Island they taken ?
they were said le des registres of des spending who were fact fact protection for des years le come .
accordingly fact , honourable senators , three of des amounts the no were not summer tax it March 1993 , even themselves they sons summer outside le des registres for M. fiscal 1993 Island 1994 .
M. Auditor General took Jews this practice , but M. government themselves fact moquait .
des Liberals had need of a 800 hour for their program political .
they were side le accept Status critical if of des media during gentleman day or two for supports their program political .
why no M. lend Island they not fact ?
they no were witness le no Opposition le M. Parliament et , le M. era , they b�n�ficiaient of M. support of media accommodants , engineers often serviles .
des parties of Opposition , M. Africa et M. Party Reform , whatever more destroy M. Party Party Island Conservative that hold of des account of M. government .
M. Party Liberal took comprehensive perp�tu� gentleman that whose he took fact a really et whose des members continues still of making , as des phoques ? that they are .
as remembered TV their false the streets all des other areas , he est even that remembered no des retain not line fact issue le regard regard also .
for . of des stories , they are very strong .
i thought that , for gentleman Liberal , this est wonderful .
means des strong for system this that .
since des Liberals or those who compound their apologie no were never held many le M. principle of M. equity Island everything est coast fact love , le Status war et fact political , said Island remembered Island free means as a better really who , namely said fact Mike , no fact that clear Status better view that took Status population of la political et of des politicians .
regardons M. matter Subcommittee gentleman another the , honourable senators , namely fact bad raises des torts le ' , et hope that means help le do understand Status situation le all des central of la deep political .
this est set this that I what do : ' des facts .
accordingly 1984 , la situation whose h�ritait M. new government Party Island Conservative was in .
M. Chief Liberal of M. Ontario , David Peterson , had stated le M. era : " Brian Mulroney h�rite of gentleman place the . "
M. Vice Island Prime Minister et Secretary of State le des Foreign regulatory made , Jean Chr , had stated , with a experience I that he no took never political since : " Carstairs more M. Access Island and Court . "
accordingly October last , Michael Bliss , streets a occasions Against : " Trudeau le 1980 years Island gentleman his claim " , took written this who following :
M. regret of M. government Trudeau le M. regard of la political economic was if full that same des the were " .
who , le share des arch�ologues of M. history , run L of M. Personnel of review of M. Plan abroad , of des worked of M. Program created National et of des the of des and et of des price ?
who themselves fact soucie ?
he took nation of la way significant :
even when Pierre Trudeau was le M. power , M. regret of des dialogue of des Liberals for that M. economy Canadian either Justice Way M. State was become continuing .
des the of class , of collectivisme et of progress Way M. �tatisation sur M. model of des socialistes themselves are effondr�es le M. Canada et streets M. world world , everything as M. socialisme him Island even .
everything this who many of M. economy Liberal of des years Trudeau , this was a tragedy montagne of high et gentleman regime of rate oppressif .
M. government Chr took tried of themselves serve totally of regard weeks of M. claim Mr. Trudeau .
honourable senators , M. fact est that M. Robertson of M. government streets M. economy et streets our lives was le his apog�e .
des raise �dict�s Way M. government et des chinoiseries force were le M. order of M. day , et des spending initiative , of des levels records .
we recall a inflation le two numbers et of des policies d�bilitantes types that M. at et M. AEIE .
M. Auditor General of M. era took substantial with justesse that M. government of M. Canada et M. Parliament sons " lost M. control of des Finance public " .
des spending for des programs sons increased of more of 14p. % Way year during 15 years .
M. deficit federal was past of nearly of are le service billion of million , et Status debt federal had increased of more of 1000p. % , some of des regarding des more important Chair the le M. era where Jean Chr was Minister of des Finance .
accordingly 1984 , p parliamentarian that new government , we we had Status also job of change des things et des recommended .
we convinced . le we atteler le Status job .
we the that we - means le des Canadians who we sons elected .
as he est said streets a study career :
des consequences le term term ... ... tienne
the policies economic of Trudeau ,
... ... tienne Island M. inflation galopante , M. expenditures fact turn open , of des rate of interest records et gentleman unemployment fact net Island the of serious problems le M. Prime Minister Mulroney et he took special long for there strategy .
he no fact nil doubt that he needed that M. Canada renverse Status April et ask le of des reform deep .
pressure were summer des results ?
if remembered New M. serving of la debt , he no there had more of deficit amend fact 1990 .
that fact est Island he of M. deficit whose we hear allows speak le M. another place et streets Status population ?
la truth , this est that , as everything commentator of la deep financial M. knows , la miss extent real of M. importance of gentleman deficit , this est M. percentage of M. cent that he represents .
means est recognized same streets M. book Red of better memories .
reflecting there it Status standard that M. Union markets was le his members who politics adh�rer le M. dealt of Maastricht , namely gentleman deficit school le per % of M. cent .
pressure are des facts ?
expressed fact percentage of M. cent , M. deficit federal took summer known cut of level Way M. government precedent , Conrad of - % fact 1984 le the % fact 1990 Island 1991 .
then , we we summer a Way a recession World who took gentleman little grug� des gain for do up M. deficit le 5,8p. % of M. cent fact 1993 Island 1994 .
accordingly despite of la recession , M. deficit was le Status end of our mandate of nearly of three points of percentage Churchill le this that he was when we caught Energy le M. power , even after des ajouts facts Way des Liberals le M. during of des five months months of M. year financial .
he est ind�niable that we we guide des Finance public streets gentleman well better state fact 1993 that when we caught Energy le M. power fact 1984 .
as gentleman analyste of M. Council Privy M. took substantial Island et he est interesting of note that regard analyste est today today le M. Senate , principally our friends of fact opposite :
... ... tienne all des debt et all des regarding of la debt national were sector le M. interest sur la debt who account prior that ...
our

M. government took situation or dissous 39 corporations of State et of other corporations of House powers .
a extent legislative took summer agreed et of des measures force were summer taken order of eliminate or of fusionner 41 departments , yet et commissions .
these measures , conjugu�es le Status efficient of des operations , were fact that effect 40,000 Post were summer supprim�s .
from Teleglobe le regarding Canada , p Mike Way for et P�tro Island Canada , of new companies corporations are groups for do Status competition et themselves region sur gentleman market global of more fact more regarding .
as et idea for were le M. payment of their sales le Bombardier of des gouffres without fund streets compete remembered the of M. money .
today today , as est gentleman success streets M. industry Canadian , with des credit of M. Challenger , of M. flying of transportation economic le students et of M. Global Express .
M. open Island free with des United Island United et M. Trade were summer et are le M. heart of many of our accomplishments .
M. Opposition , especially similar of des Liberals , took summer substantial would .
reflecting took diabolis�M. Mulroney et line fact issue our free .
he est now clear that we we chosen Status right seaway for M. Canada .
banking des Liberals achieved Justice le these policies without broncher ?
reflecting seems bringing develop Commerce now that des Liberals themselves are who with over le M. Agreement of open Island free with des United Island United et le M. Trade who the M. light for des accept then without reserve when they are Energy le M. power .
accordingly 1988 , la last year prior Status implementation fact implementation of M. Agreement of open Island free between M. Canada et des United Island United , our exports of goods moving des United Island United themselves are high le possibly billion of million .
honourable senators , he took special 120 years le printed of la Confederation for that our exports moving des United Island United levels % billion of million .
he no took special that ten years streets M. framework of M. open Island free for the des amount billion of million .
welcome des calamit�s who eligible themselves abattre sur we according des Liberals le Status follow of la concluded of M. Agreement of open Island free , he there had Status stand of M. insurance Island infected , of M. development economic et of our graduate written .
without M. open Island free , our economy avoided could strong well stagner le M. during of des years effect .
means no means not say that everything means no took not summer chosen without great nor by .
as M. Council Museum of des leaders of businesses M. took demagogic :
our exports were summer M. , Status more , streets Status galaxie Canadian .
he est just of say without " that M. open Island free est gentleman success remarkable .
who could never remember everything M. chahut that he there took privileged streets this visit ?
accordingly fact , he citing very difficult of find gentleman precedent streets whole our history .
during des election of 1993 , des Liberals were 18 of introduction this tax et of la replace .
des Canadians were voted fact great number fact � that this citing M. cases .
six years more later , this tax est always headed .
why ?
la response est legal .
reflecting took faith that he themselves branch of a tax original much et we of M. developed of view Economic .
means themselves est also the is for our economy , particularly le M. level of des exports , et M. government fact took learned of des revenues important .
M. teachers tax of their % sur des credit of des replace that we we the joint a tax the nuisible le des exports .
M. Agreement of open Island free between M. Canada et des United Island United , M. Trade , la GST , la privatization , la canada , M. removal of M. Program created National et M. energy of M. Personnel of review of M. Plan abroad Way Investissement Canada are all of des measures bad part of la restructuring et of la modernization of M. economy Canadian .
from gentleman developed of view tax , la reduction of M. deficit et Status restructuring of M. government were began early 1984 , et non fact 1994 as some persons trying of M. do grounds .
his Honour M. Speaker :
hon. Senator LeBreton , I I M. unfortunately of you regret , but your time of speak est you .
M. Senator LeBreton :
honourable senators , me donnez Island you Status leave of continue ?
his Honour M. Speaker :

from des Senators :
from agreed .
M. Senator LeBreton :
all these courageuses policies were two good fact common .
this est gentleman government Conservative who des took concerted et des Liberals des were all combattues , this against each of firms .
when M. government Mulroney took fixed M. power fact June 1993 , he there had nicotine million of jobs of more that fact September 1984 .
M. rate cent was of 6 per , M. level M. more low fact 20 years .
M. rate of inflation was of year % , M. rate M. more low fact 30 years .
des United Voluntary huge of contempt that M. Canada follow M. Prime valued le M. world for this who est of la quality of la life .
but this who regardless still more , honourable senators , this est that des recommended were policy .
thanks le our efforts , des Canadians were including M. importance of la reduction of M. deficit , this that they no were not loans le do he there took ten years .
he there took few years , des beautiful Thomas Velk et A . v. . Riggs of M. University Dr. , codirecteurs of M. program of des studies North Island American le Dr. , were , Status his economic of M. Canada Subcommittee all des Ministers ministers since Status War War World .
these experts of M. economy were compar� des results regarding M. unemployment , M. inflation , la growth , M. rate of interest , la value of M. expenditures , la manner of M. income , M. deficit et des rate of rate .
instead whatever concluded fact are Island they Energy ?
i true directly of their study .
M. subject objective of Mulroney Island ownership le des numbers sur la his real of M. economy Canadian Island est M. better of des 35 recent years .
as I M. I said le M. early , all these facts ind�niables themselves are perdus streets Status turbulence of la misinformation et of la document of la truth of la share of la take was of regarding called Alternative Party Liberal of M. Canada .
des the fact Communications of des Liberals et their friends l�che Island and streets des media saying now le M. country le ones developed M. government present took courageusement itself M. deficit , redress� M. economy et lives M. country .
it Chr et Paul Martin were already been their aur�ole .
this view and around of M. allegations according commentary M. new government Liberal had left fact 1993 of a situation economic et budget substantial concerned .
meetings of gentleman debate been le M. during of la campaign election of 1997 , Mr. Chr took same mentioned of la " situation in " whose he had left .
Mr. . Chr conference can Island be a another of his fameuses come with des without Island Relief .
he no had course left of Jager of becomes .
M. workplace the had summer fact for a strong resuming economic health sur des exports .
our policies were little gentleman change structurel deep le M. Canada , sur M. plan of des taxes , of M. inflation et of des trade trade .
firms were impopulaires , but necessary .
honourable senators , des Canadians should with reason themselves the of these results , but required Island Use M. deserves , of M. less fact part , le who he talk .
as M. former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney M. took demagogic gentleman day , des ministers of des Finance Michael Wilson et soon the were that M. the et Paul Martin fact cueille des games .
accordingly parliamentarian that report , I me welcome of these results et I no rechigne not le recognize Mr. Martin everything M. deserves who him talk .
we all who , currently le M. Parliament we fact effect Status opportunity of see of des policies �prement have produce finally of des results benefit who the Status senior Economic of our country .
honourable senators , we we said le des Canadians Status truth that they eligible got le M. regarding of M. open Island free , of M. Trade , of la GST , of la reduction of M. deficit , of la low inflation , of M. Pearson Pearson , of M. 500 of des helicopters et we we same area streets this party long Parliamentary that est Status responsibility yesterday .
our policies economic were summer strong have streets of many enhanced , but we we side ground et ground read that if firms were various et implemented fact due sur a long period , M. Canada citing a dealing against .
M. deficit citing itself , des exports conna�traient a growth , et M. well Island be economic of des Canadians et of des members of their families bound am�lior�s streets gentleman behind non inflationniste .
we no we not 18 Status . ; we we everything simply said that he there avoided of des progress substantial .

sur this , M. Senator Opposition Island Staunton took question M. amendment fact program M. Rules .
M. Senator Carstairs , assure M. Senator Kinsella were stated that they were of agreed with la position of M. Senator Opposition Island Staunton .
staffing le these concerns , M. Senator Cools took matter that M. amendment proposed objective le restrictions of des restrictions le who that either .
streets this cases Island side , however , M. Senator Cools took contrary that Chair given that M. project of bill within a needs Royal fact upon sur des powers of la other relatively le Status Assent Royal , he compensated give a have as talking M. Governor General or funds name Status Privy the le Status proposal national streets M. project of bill S Island 7 .
M. Senator Cools took given as example M. debate who took senator M. study of la Parliament giving fact 1911 , bill who attendance M. Parliament le adopt of des projects of bill fact , Status chamber of des member .
i I , since M. remedy le M. Rules , examined all des facts et am now prepared le me deal .
everything of first , he there took streets my spirit two elements le necessity streets this remedy le M. Rules .
M. Prime , although sure , troops la question of des the the .
M. second door sur M. kind of amendment who est authorized le M. reading of la second reading .
i traiterai of first of M. second discussed .
instead Status second reading , M. Senate est types le vote sur M. principle of M. project of bill , that M. Senate accept or non his intended first .
this law of M. principle of M. project of bill took leading le limited M. kind of amendment who can be proposed le this reading .
instead share Status motion of issue pre , who est a motion of energy , he there took substance two food of amendment who are licences fact second reading , M. referred le several months et M. amendment what .
M. referred le several months designed le refer M. study of M. project of bill fact strategy that he either read : " a second read streets six or three months le rely of this day " .
la form of la motion est well established ; she took summer created Way M. Parliament British he there took more of two centuries order of current Status definition too close of M. term " now " streets Status motion usuelle Authorize second reading : " communities M. project of bill ... ... tienne either now read a second read " .
from our days , she strong expertise le continue M. debate , Chair given that she give le des persons who themselves are already concerns sur la motion holds Status possibility of take le new Status speak .
M. amendment what , Way against , est gentleman basic for do they a statement or a Young , Subcommittee form of motion , for mention why gentleman project of bill no should not be read a second read .
streets des facts , as M. let M. draw the Parliamentary of Beauchesne , 6e plans , le M. regard 670 , le Status page 207 , M. amendment what must answer le some criteria .
M. amendment what must plan something principle who the le M. dealing or themselves . of des principles , of des objectives or of des provisions of M. project of bill or he can speak des circumstances provisions le Status Presented or le M. review of M. project of bill , or fact do points of other for themselves 50 le his adoption .
from more , M. regard 671 agreed 3 ) , le Status page 208 , historians hear that M. amendment what no must not question of conditions le Status second reading .
citation M. amendment proposed Way M. Senator Cools M. 1 December :
that M. project of bill S Island 7 no either not now read a second read , but rather when his for remplira Status condition exig�e Way Status bill of M. Parliament prior M. adoption Way M. Parliament of gentleman project of bill of initiative Parliamentary amendments a needs Royal , this condition hold Chair Status order of M. consent to of funds name le M. study Way M. Parliament of his interests streets M. project of bill S Island 7 , who move of limited et of change des formalit�s of novo of la Assent Royal Way funds name le M. Canada , et of M. same encourage of change Status made of M. Senate .
Way therefore , la motion of amendment no est not . et no can be implementation le des Senators as amendment le M. reading of la second reading of M. project of bill S Island 7 .
means however no rule not M. problem complete .
as I M. I said on , he there took two aspects le necessity streets this remedy le M. Rules .
as M. took indicated M. Senator Cools streets his Robertson , M. consent est necessary when gentleman project of bill stand receive des the , des revenues h�r�ditaires , des property or M. interest gain of la Crown .
streets this cases Island side , he no fact nil doubt that M. single regarding of M. project of bill S Island 7 est 22 of la needs Royal .
M. project of bill no 50 no clause regarding des property or M. interest gain of la Privy .
la question le commentary he must answer , then , est of whether if gentleman project of bill who move of des formalit�s other that Status Ceremony of Assent Royal amend a needs of la Crown .
accordingly some his developed of view , M. Senator Cools themselves est . le of des hear facts le M. Parliament British during M. debate negotiations Status Parliament giving fact 1911 .
i concerns no not too whether how regard example can might des circumstances who we step .
des comments of Liberal Lansdowne compound raises Status need of obtain M. consent to when gentleman project of bill amend a needs Royal , without however mention Status nature nor Status broad of la needs Royal , particularly fact this who took truck le des the constitutional of M. Canada .
from after Beauchesne , la question of M. consent to can be , important for Status decision final regarding gentleman project of bill .
instead M. regard 726 agreed 2 ) , le Status page 221 , he est said that " his alone agreed M. consent to ) Chalifoux nulles et non to des deliberations proposed fact view of M. adoption of M. project of bill " .
as of many honourable senators M. know , this no est not Status first read that M. Senate active gentleman project of bill sur la Assent Royal .
accordingly 1985 , M. Committee of des privileges , of M. Rules et of la procedure took panacea gentleman report sur la Assent Royal , who billion consumer Status Letter of a resolution for that a my joint either action le M. Governor General completed that he agree Status proc of la Ceremony of Assent Royal .
however , M. report no took never summer passed Way M. Senate .
instead M. during of my research , I I also understood that , when M. Parliament British had passed M. 22 Assent giving fact � , M. consent to took summer , parliamentarian le Status chamber of des member that le Status chamber of des House prior M. adoption of M. project of bill .
accordingly fact , M. consent to took summer control prior Status second reading , as M. Senator Cools orders that remembered Terrorism with M. project of bill S Island 7 .
sur this issue , Beauchesne standing le M. regard 726 agreed 2 ) that " M. brings means that M. consent to either , early M. would of M. debate " .
streets M. rule following , Beauchesne let le M. regard 727 agreed 1 ) that " well that M. consent incurred be , le no regardless whatever reading of des deliberations year M. adoption clear of M. project of bill , M. brings of la chamber agreed the House ) means that he M. either meetings of la Presented of la motion Authorize second reading " .
from more , he seems that M. brings of , M. consent to le M. Canada no took nearly never affected M. Senate et Status chamber of des House .
streets des many cases where M. consent to took summer disposable et , , I I understood that he est expertise , le Status chamber of des House et welcome le M. Senate .
accordingly fact , I no I found that gentleman cases where M. consent to took summer , streets our chamber .
means themselves est past fact practice , just prior Status second reading of M. project of bill 192 , An amendments Status Act sur des given of right .
M. brings le M. Canada from give M. consent to le Status chamber of des House only took summer call Way M. draw of procedure Parliamentary Parliamentary Procedure consolidated Practice poverty Reference Dominion Reference Canada from John Bourinot , who George le 1884 , streets his first plans .
gentleman example s of 1886 , 1999 streets Status fourth plans of and , give gentleman example where M. consent to took summer , , le Status chamber of des House et non le M. Senate , streets M. cases of gentleman amendment Way M. Senate le gentleman project of bill Privy of des Commons .
means seems gentleman example acceptable of a Honourable le des the of " .
that do streets des us circumstances ?
as I M. I already expressed , remembered no can using gentleman amendment what as M. Senator Cools M. took proposed .
he avoided can Island be better funds points Status question Subcommittee form of remedy le M. Rules le M. held of novo gentleman amendment le M. reading of la motion of second reading .
nevertheless , even Subcommittee form of remedy le M. Rules , I no I nothing heard who me , , p my quality of Speaker , le refer M. debate sur M. project of bill S Island 7 le M. reading of la second reading .
M. consent to est can Island be necessary , but fact visible of des advantage parliamentarians , he seems that nothing no require the that M. consent to either given fact this visit .
accordingly died , I Auditor that M. amendment no est not . et that M. debate fact second reading sur M. respecting bill S Island 7 can themselves continue .
i move however that , if this project of bill est passed fact second reading , M. Committee refers M. project of bill eliminated out active also Status question of M. consent to .

reflecting can themselves ask if gentleman the as Gaston Miron , Way example , apparel pleased of literacy gentleman , for Status family Royal .
we could can Island be eliminate Status need of literacy of des the le M. regarding of M. State .
i think that this citing gentleman not streets Status right leadership .
M. Committee could hoped look this proposal .
this est Status seaway that des Americans were far with success .
when M. last the official est death fact powers Island concerning , of many other po�tes were guide whether that M. station no des we not .
la reason , this est that Status most of between themselves no politics not addressed this station , of M. fact that Status Prairie means that M. developed �crive of des the for M. State .
M. late the irlandais Michael Hartnett took already said that Status about was gentleman offence of r�bellion .
M. the Paul Durcan est become gentleman friend very future of let and et he took distinguished gentleman , for his the le Status Chair of la Republic of Ireland , but Paul est M. material rather that Status rule .

Andrew Debate , who had cri� sur all des the that he convoitait M. employment , took demagogic that he he this station as " gentleman challenge substantial project et interesting for gentleman the . "
he took demagogic :
i think that I wish implement fact value des responsibilities during who consistent le report of des the for of des opportunities , , consumer , but that I wish also many le on M. employment or , of M. less , le literacy of des the disability of des knowledge declaration more given whose I wish also speak .
he took demagogic that he wanted fact particular promote Status about le M. school .

he took published nine , of moving , prepared a biography of Keats in Way Status critical et won M. price Whitbread for his biography of Larkin , gentleman the who took refused M. station of the official .
surely , M. station fact parliamentarian that becomes no est not use held fact high estimated , but Status convention for his supply risk of significant gentleman great interest .
des paris plans are taken parWilliam Scientology , la holds 2 of paris of la powers Island concerning .
moreover Ms stated , la list of short understand Seamus Heaney , Derek Walcott , Wendy Cope , the Zephaniah , James Fenton , Tom Paulin etGeoffrey Scientology .

welcome des po�tes plans of des United Island United , remembered account Robert Penn to , Richard Wilbur , to Nemerov , P Strand , Joseph Brodsky , Mona Children Duyn , Rita Dove , Robert Hass et Robert Pinsky .
accordingly 1984 , Robert Penn to took summer appointed Prime of the of des United Island United for a length of gentleman year Way Status Library of M. Congress .
la appointment 30 gentleman year , but she est the .
many , said Island remembered , were charged le can that des Americans were more of wish that des Britanniques with their the official , Alberta because that he leading gentleman role many more . .
instead my notice , honourable , this est gentleman well better role that 22 who themselves knew le aware of des moving for des events plans .
accordingly concluded , honourable senators , I indicated that , le my notice , M. project of bill S Island 5 est a right idea who deserves that remembered M. active real .
he citing can Island be good of themselves ask if M. payments " the official " est M. more appropriate .
instead des United Island United , he themselves Order M. " Po�te advisor of la the of M. Congress " .

la majority speaking of M. Ontario est a any cultural et language et she took need of his graduate who . his culture et his French against M. assimilation .
des hands were takes that M. government of M. Ontario themselves must of meet M. principle of la protection of des minorities streets all his actions .
they were of agreed for say that des francophones were gentleman right constitutional des we against M. assimilation , because they compound part of a community cultural le M. Canada et are M. gentleman of des two groups language whose des rights are ench�ss�s streets Status Constitution .
la court stated , et I true :

M. board story took strategy le this regarding .
if you intervention t , and Island including , but no you choquez not .
Way against , of other serious that she offer can Island be a weapon puissante for Status protection of des rights of des minorities .

M. government took disgraceful that he road without reserve regard Appeal .
even if a partisan fact justice no , not le remain M. government of M. Ontario le run Status new city of Ottawa as record the , she could serve le of des purpose of political public .
she avoided certainly for effect of better do got Status question .
if she predicted Teleglobe M. with of des enjoy ports , of des pressure themselves exerceraient sur M. government Comments ; Way against , she risk of desire M. Opposition et M. , of those who quality le address a read for all Status question of M. with .
M. Senate took slight subject of retirement des regions of M. country et especially of protect des minorities .
a motion could be tabled le M. Senate completed le M. government of M. Ontario of run Status new city of Ottawa as record the .

he we fact of des recommendations quasiment le all des days for he des drop .
if this no est not of M. living Comments , I no know not this that this est .
moreover that he there took series majority speaking appr�ciable streets Status region of Ottawa , des courts recognize of more fact more Status protection of des minorities as gentleman principle Subcommittee Island government of la Constitution , gentleman principle who took series value section .
M. recent judgment regarding M. two the report sur la question of whether if M. education speaking predicted be ( Way a institution . .
M. project of with of la city of Ottawa , Way against , no relative that Status question of M. Commission .
nevertheless , he est trade that some of des enjoy who manage regroup�es , consumer , Vanier , Gloucester et the , were a population speaking appr�ciable thus that a long long of Commission official .

for more of system , he then better that Status bill Comments the forward of la question .
la question of M. Commission can be very the , as streets M. cases of M. matter David the et similar of M. two the .
he citing more responsible of la share of M. government of M. Ontario of do evidence of exercise fact d�cidant of run early M. tributes Status city regroup�e as record the .
M. report Mr. Shortliffe est step prepared et , .
as he M. Auditor , M. uniqueness speaking et speaking of la region fact part of his , single .
M. government of M. Ontario should implement fact implementation this important recommendation .
streets Status decision that she took decision streets M. matter Monro , p House , la Court Supreme of M. Canada generally clear M. power of M. government federal sur la region of la important national .
this est headed something something who should or who already . Ottawa of his come et of des other regions of M. Ontario .
la Court Coast of M. Ontario took of more reminded des four principles who Subcommittee Island barristers our Constitution : Status democracy , M. federalism , M. constitutionnalisme et Status protection of des minorities , particularly Status majority speaking .
these principles were summer standard Way Status Court Supreme of M. Canada streets des causes in on , M. Renvoi of la for of M. Quebec et M. matter Beaulac .
la position of M. government fact Ontario seems whatever allowing le Status city of Ottawa his , of city record the .

accordingly concluded , honourable senators , I committed for say that Status city of Ottawa est single .
she est Status important national of gentleman country record the .
if she must how Status important national , I saying well if , et continue of fact of des benefits such le this status , she should be record the .
accordingly more of his role of important national , la city of Ottawa est states le Status border of M. Quebec et of M. Ontario .
she took series history et a culture francophones off et account a majority speaking appr�ciable .
instead a era of since value regarding Status Confederation et Status for of M. Quebec , la question of la nature of of la important national an a importance support .
moreover that he there took series majority speaking appr�ciable streets Status region of Ottawa , des courts recognize of more fact more Status protection of des minorities as gentleman principle Subcommittee Island government of la Constitution et a value section .
M. editor consolidated Mail no took not summer also an shown Status question of M. two Monfort .

this est this that we then .
M. hon. Serge Joyal :
moreover that she abolit of gentleman fourth of and M. result of several years of fight et that thus , she fragilise le new Status community other franco Island court , she is of continue Status views research , M. could that we we caught fact of this country where , streets his important national , his two main communaut language fondatrices can living streets M. regard , run yesterday et themselves involved le M. representation M. a of M. another .
des governments advantage of des honourable John Robarts , Budgets Davis , David Peterson et the Rae no lend not summer also then .
M. government Harris no themselves fact est not realized account , but he attack M. idea Canadian streets his legal same .
he there took streets this court a d�n�gation of our community , a particular the of des efforts of those et Right who we were the , et a hallmark of it sur des or et M. indifference who , the Island we , sons " home des leadership who we gouvernent .
Ottawa no est not a city as des other .
this est Status holds , of la important of M. Canada .
M. government et M. Parliament of M. Canada op�rent streets des two languages official of M. country .
la Constitution Canadian there pourvoit et Status Court Supreme of M. Canada M. took man studies streets his mine of M. 20 August 1998 sur la for of M. Quebec .
regard mine est basic for understand des principles who we entire et who are le Status Basic of our life democratic .
these principles , November Island M. , are le M. number of four : M. federalism , la democracy , M. constitutionnalisme et Status rule of right , et finally , et non M. lower , la protection of des rights of des minorities .
this est sur this last principle , " Status protection of des rights of des minorities " , that I like attention your attention .
honourable senators , I am of notice that Status decision of M. government the of introduction des laws proposed of la city of Ottawa et of Vanier , who their the M. status of city " the " for des replace Way a another bill where this protection est disparue , est , le my notice , anticonstitutionnelle et step le M. principle basic of protection of des rights of des minorities language recognized Way Status Court Supreme of M. Canada streets his mine of M. 20 August 1998 .
how can Island we remain to before Status man9uvre who challenge le introduction M. status the of two cities , Ottawa et Vanier , for des , streets gentleman great everything fusionn� , ignorant argument M. effect that a ceremony initiative speaks sur des rights of la community other of fran official ?
the well M. precedent ; he look of proceed Way M. basic of des main report for do set of indeed years of fight .
reflecting M. took scaffold recently streets M. example of M. two the .
he took list of whatever Status fusionner with three other hospital of la region of Ottawa Island region for Status do replacement of gentleman fourth of and .
la Court Coast of M. Ontario took recently , M. 29 November last , streets gentleman judgment agreement of three hands , cass� this decision le M. basis that she was would , because that step le Status protection of des rights of la majority franco Island court .
let Island me of remind des elements essential of M. judgment of la Court of M. Ontario streets this matter .
la court took of first recognized that M. two Monfort jouait gentleman role who the develop Status region of Ottawa Island region for themselves region le Status province full .
she took of more resigned that Status community franco Island court predicted stop allows against des forces of assimilation for power life .
la court took further , et I true :
regard must serving le Status page 6 of M. judgment .
for life , these communaut language must power themselves support sur gentleman Lawrence of graduate who supportent their development et and des forces of assimilation .
i true :
M. uniqueness speaking of their graduate est therefore become of more fact more significant for obligations M. role who challenge le population et le protect this culture .
this pleasant est Somalia of la page 7 of M. judgment .
thus , these graduate must having streets a professional of . of activities social also broad that possible for allow le Status community other of themselves yesterday et of maintain his minority .
des graduate are also of des show substantial for Status community franco Island court .
firms direct M. identity of group , la presence French fact Ontario et le M. Canada , la really French streets Status life public et Status strength et Status minority of la community .
regard must themselves wherever le Status page 7 of M. judgment .
la court took recognized M. importance of la langue fran for produced Status life of la community .
la langue fran est M. discussed cultural basic of la community franco Island court .
reflecting wherever means le Status page 8 of M. judgment .
honourable senators , all these good no themselves apply Island tracked not when he themselves branch of la new city of Ottawa , where des francophones are more of years 40,000 citizens et future more of per % of la population amount ?
la city of Ottawa no est Island she not , for Status more vast share , M. , land of la Commission of la important national , she Island even body the ?
how des francophones of M. country , who s�journent streets Status important for there retirement their region , r�agissent Island they opposite le M. indifference of M. government the le M. regard of M. sign same of la life national ?
from des - of Ottawa M. sons d�ja including .
why plans of des years of regard language for that le new des francophones le return sur la barricade of des concern ?
why significant le new des the policies when Status peace language had successful le themselves establish streets M. Alternative opinion ?
non , la decision of M. government the est step le M. spirit of our Constitution .
she the M. commitment of Alternative of M. equality between des two communaut , who est M. touchstone same of M. " Museum .
la Court Coast of M. Ontario M. took well reminded : M. principle of protection of des rights of des minorities , et I true :
... no compound not that " objective " of des rights .
they infusent Status life streets our Constitution .
although that this either of des principles Subcommittee Island and et non continuing of la Constitution , they biological dealing do life of des rights legal point who limiteraient current M. partisan of M. government ; fact addition , these principles are " also or of a strength normative puissante et and le Status read des courts et des governments " .
instead regard regard , la court citait M. Renvoi Economic le Status for of M. Quebec ... 1998 , 2 v. . C . S . 217 ... , pages 248 et 249 of M. notice of M. tribunal .
M. Canada , took demagogic Status Court Supreme , est a democracy section .
states simply , M. principle of M. constitutionnalisme through that whole partisan of M. government respect Status Constitution .
reflecting wherever means le Status page 8 of M. judgment .
M. initiative legislative of M. government the , who abolit M. status of city the for Status new city of Ottawa ...
... must be . le M. aune of la " protection of des minorities " , M. gentleman of des principles structurants basic of la Constitution .
if Status conduct est . et the this principle , la court of review must intervene ...
means themselves wherever le Status page 20 of M. judgment .
honourable senators , he we must learn des findings who themselves CWB .
Je that M. principle of la protection of des minorities Island et especially of des minorities francophones Island est gentleman principle independent et Subcommittee Island government of la Constitution , gentleman principle much of a strength normative puissante who is M. government , la court must intervene le M. need for protect lesdites minorities against whole Robertson of M. government who putting le M. dealing of this principle .
regard must themselves wherever le Status page 23 of M. judgment .
des citizens francophones of la city of Ottawa et of Vanier , et , le gentleman another consistent , those of des cities of the et of Gloucester be their right of receive of la new city of des services fact French .
he fact those of same for des other Canadians who s�journent le Ottawa for there retirement their commettants , their region or their each Standing , as this est M. cases for me Island even .
he we must therefore , le M. government the that themselves he leading of the Status introduce who abolit for Status new city of Ottawa M. status of city the , a include eliminated company before des courts . knowledgeable for do contempt nulles et non to des provisions of M. project of bill who aboliraient Status learning of M. French streets des statuts of la new city .
honourable senators , he there took series towards sympathy le discussed gentleman right Way follow of a initiative of proposed who designed le noyer streets gentleman great everything a community who disposait previously of right full .
he citing really too simple of proceed thus for current des principles who are le Status Basic of our order constitutional .
this est headed M. could same who est le Status Basic of M. identity et of la over of our country .
regard could no est not balance , et he must always there contribute , he no there took not of repos for those who M. serving .
we no can allow that of des politicians provincial , le understanding view , and of vision national , and thus our could without that we r�agissions with des means that Status bill research of our country we the .
no more not this court become M. sign of la the of our community , out of tailler his hearts streets Status important of our country .
honourable senators , this est my strong intended of me begin le this that a partisan fact issues either company against Status bill inquiry who refuserait of recognize des rights learning of la majority speaking of Ottawa et of all des citizens of this country who common deep fact M. equality of status of des two languages official .
Prouvons that a read that gentleman government took recognized gentleman matter of status le our community , he no can more act of manner the , et create le new M. like .
he there took 23 years , I entamais of des Director against M. Minister of des Transport of M. era of my own government , for do contempt proposed gentleman claims allowing M. brings of M. French streets des cabines of authorities ; he there took 23 years , I entamais also a include against regarding Canada , society of la Crown , for M. takes le themselves seat of keep for do of M. French a French of workplace fact thousands .
des two Kyoto were summer of by Way des courts parliamentarians .
he there took 17 years , le payments of Secretary of State of M. Canada , I contribuais le implement sur feet M. program of times news for help des communaut language of languages official le do meet their rights .
yet today today , he 50 do Appeal le this program for support our determination le fact tell Status survival et M. rayonnement .
M. government the took decided of bringing M. judgment of M. two Monfort fact Appeal .
he took basic appropriate of fact one Status good .
let Status fight , if necessary , far fact Court Supreme of M. Canada , headed where our rights must receive their last learning .
i look therefore des senators Marie Island Herv .
Poulin , Jean Island Robert Gauthier thus that des citizens of Ottawa et of everything M. Canada le heard le des courts for protect their rights et those of all those who common fact gentleman country where M. equality of M. French et of M. English est gentleman could of la et of freedom single for Status dignity tragedy .
M. hon. Jerahmiel S . Grafstein :
honourable senators , I chair few issues le question le M. Senator Joyal .
his Honour M. Speaker :
since M. time extend le M. Senator Joyal est you , let Island you le M. hon. Senator of continue le question of des issues ?
from des Senators :
from agreed .
M. hon. John Lynch Island Staunton ( Chief of M. Opposition ) :
honourable senators , he making le be later et some of between we were of des obligations .
M. Senator Grafstein :
honourable senators , I wish M. well of M. Chief of M. Opposition le M. spirit et I difficult short .
la question est important .
we we heard three senators francophones speak of this regarding .
i I a well et a issue le introduce le M. hon. Senator .
surely , I wherever incompr�hensible that Status political bipartite of M. government of M. Ontario no retain not summer of go of M. prior of way , .
des Ministers ministers Robarts et Davis , of M. Party Conservative , M. Prime Minister Peterson , of M. Party Liberal , thereby that M. Prime Minister Rae , of M. some , bound certainly irrit�s Island et I hope that we des , give their notice Island before this diversion et these gamineries of M. government of M. Ontario .
i saying means le payments of Senator of la region of Toronto .
if M. hon. Senator putting of M. prior with his remedy before des courts , I difficult pleased of do continue common with him le payments of Senator representing Toronto .
he est significant that of des senators non francophones hear state of their the before des policies various streets Status region that they future .
la first constitutional le gap Status RCMP cost of la Commission of la important national , this who , I now , could themselves do Way gentleman project of bill of initiative Parliamentary presented le M. Senate .
Way therefore , he est clear that everything M. territory of la important national est the .
second , took he plan M. remedy le M. power of the of la bill Comments whose standing M. government federal ?
M. Senator Joyal :
honourable senators , la question that M. Senator Grafstein interest est a issue who , p right , est project .
la Commission of la important national no refers not Status jurisdiction him allowing of provide of des services becoming streets of des areas as those of des the , of Police , of des facilities of , , et cetera .
according Status Commission of la important national , des provisions of - , include of other responsibilities , particularly fact report with la presence of M. government federal .
i talking here of des services of administration et other who , far le gentleman number point , recoupent those of M. administration municipale .
even if we - region des line of la Commission of la important national for that firms regroupent M. together of M. territory positions Way Status new city , des line of la new city of Ottawa bound by Way Status bill as this est M. cases of la city present .
accordingly this who relative M. power of - , des honourable senators long that this est a issue very project .
la Court Supreme of M. Canada took time that gentleman power no can be his parliamentarian et also long that he serving streets Status Constitution .
however , this est headed a issue sur commentary should themselves Lavoie M. government of M. Canada if a recommendation was eye le Status gouverneure General of M. Canada streets this environment et fact fair account that this power no took not summer used since very long .
passing he had summer used , this citing streets of des circumstances special .
this could be headed gentleman raccourci for discussions le Status solution that we wish , but he exists of other means who biological be everything also effective .
he citing proposal for all des Canadians of all des provinces that a decision either taken streets this file .
i do M. Senator Opposition Island Staunton of M. another side of la chamber .
he knows that University Hatley et Ayer' St. Cliff are fact emerging of fusionner streets M. same environment .
however , if these cities fusionnent , operating Hatley perdra M. status of city the that him staff M. d 13 rule ) of la Act sur la langue fran le M. Quebec .
they want fusionner des services .
something 40 % of la population of la new city bound of fran English , this who themselves the Way Status lost of their status the .
this issue an a ceremony importance that he est contempt of him contribute a solution Way M. ways of gentleman power of - .
he est very significant streets this country that des rights individual of la majority , that she either of fran English or of fran fran , recommend they .
accordingly of other words , a read that these rights were summer recognized , they no can be then down Way of des objectives costs who are which sur M. plan financial but who school le a destruction total of these same rights for Status majority .

instead term term , M. Committee est of notice that he must change des sections obtain of la Convention of was order that des companies marine et their assureurs side a 800 responsibility for des transportation et M. regarding follow le des accidents marine .

M. developed raised Way M. Senator Doody was that remembered no scene no clause streets M. Estimates of des spending for M. matter sur M. equity line , that M. government took place before des courts Island for say des things types that firms are .
we in all , I think , that this est a issue of taken of la share of M. government .
streets this cases Island side , he took amass� M. money streets M. Vote of des and et of des benefits social , where person no finest course not M. find .
des officials servants we were well said that if remembered their had asked of des issues streets M. intervalle , they des lend esquiv�es .

now that M. matter close le his end Island M. government eliminated still quelquefois sur la sellette Island M. government are M. money pursuant le M. section 30 of la Act sur la responsibility of M. State .
M. Parliament no speaks not Status lower opportunity of themselves deal sur la question nor of discussion of M. amount paid , nor of la way whose he eliminated paid , nor of des reasons for reasons he est paid , nor same of la political of M. government , et thus of follow .
this est a issue who took tracass� des best funding of M. Committee , namely des senators Bolduc , Doody , Cools et Moore , consumer .
i no should not mentioned these senators , because all des members of M. Committee themselves are many t le this issue .

M. hon. A . Raynell Andreychuk :
honourable senators , M. project of bill S Island 3 took summer out le two committees .
i no about not of la decision of M. Committee of des banks le M. regard of M. project of bill nor of M. study that he him took period .
instead first view , M. project of bill S Island 3 est , probably , a extent designed le avoid Status opinion taxation .
he relative several country with compete we we M. intended of to or streets compete we want b , et he est therefore streets M. interest opinion of M. Canada et of des country bring of adopt a ceremony extent legislative .
honourable senators , des projects of bill allowing of avoid Status opinion taxation no are not a , .
M. Parliament fact longer since strong long .
as M. were indicated des servants of M. Personnel of M. income , their analysis includes two the for ensure le this that des citizens who a of des affairs streets of other country no recommend not , two read .
M. purpose of des projects of bill fact equity of opinion taxation est of see le this that he no there retain not of the tax .
des projects of bill of this kind market le M. government more of leviers him allowing of ensure le this that all des taxes exigibles recommend two .
however , I am the that M. project of bill S Island 3 retain fact M. subject of M. kind of review refers no were not summer submitted of other projects of bill streets M. past , although that means avoided subsequently be M. cases .
he there took series material past of appear , et this est M. agreed sur M. the tax who took summer examined le M. Committee of des affairs Foreign , rather that le M. Committee of des banks , p May 1998 . This my memories est raising , M. agreed themselves was le of des country as Status rate , M. Chile et M. Vietnam .
M. Committee of des affairs Foreign took resigned that M. remembered no predicted not acting themselves concerned of rate et that M. remembered predicted deal Status extent legislative fact fair account of all des aspects of la political foreign .
as M. know des honourable senators , after bringing began le deal with gentleman country , he sometimes streets of many cases that we fact we le accept their security , their values et their recommended .
instead M. payment of M. review Way M. Committee , M. Senator anyone Nino et of other members of M. Committee , whose M. Senator Grafstein , if I me reminds well , were expressed M. notice that we should bringing M. insurance that des country with compete we , of des Agreements sur M. the tax framework des security Kyoto , consumer of des courts independent .
they must recognize Status law of M. right .

if of des businesses must do matter addition Island sea et that fact reason of gentleman agreed allowing of avoid Status opinion taxation firms are thanks of will their Finance et their worked of operations le gentleman another country , we must be clear that these country no materials these information that le des purpose protection streets M. agreed tax et non for of other assess .
M. experience me took learned that fact of many other country , la information est a concept who no exists not .
if gentleman Department longer of M. line , he est less respectueux of des rules of procedure , of la information et of des rights of des duty et of des citizens .
fortunately , M. number of these country tax , but they are still gentleman regarding of concern .
accordingly May 1998 , even if we recall passed M. project of bill allowing of avoid Status opinion taxation , we we stated that M. Department of des Foreign Foreign should proceed le a analysis full for see if M. country with cetera we - authorities gentleman agreed allowing of avoid Status opinion taxation had gentleman subject acceptable fact equity of Alternative of des rights of la person et of des course Kyoto fact equity of made , of practice et of procedure .
we must we ensure that when we , M. agreed fact issue , we no . not le body le our citizens et le des citizens of this country .
this well took summer eye streets this visit .
we we indicated le M. Department of des Foreign Foreign thus that le des other departments bring et le M. Senate that all des Agreements of this kind should be i le Status light of means .
honourable senators , I I said le des representatives of des Foreign Foreign that gentleman project of bill allowing of avoid Status opinion taxation no should not be presented le M. Parliament without a analysis full of M. Alternative of des rights of la person Way M. country fact issue .
reflecting us took test that this kind of analysis going streets M. sense of this that M. government of M. era he as a right practice .
however , des bring that we we appointments le M. opportunity of this project of bill no were not had of follow , seems he .
i me welcome of M. fact that M. Senator Opposition Island Staunton retain defence with tree of over Status question of M. Alternative of des rights of la person , et M. Senate should M. fact thank .
he took task fact issue M. choice of M. Committee refers this project of bill citing out .
must Island he M. send speaking le M. Committee of des banks or , this who est more logical , le M. Committee of des affairs Foreign ?
i am pleased that M. Senate retain out this project of bill le M. Committee of des affairs Foreign .
streets his Robertson , M. Senator Opposition Island Staunton took indicated that we should , streets this visit , Clement our Kyoto . le our special words le M. regarding of M. Alternative of des rights of la person .
i think that we should hold account of these comments .
streets this visit , we caught very proud of our reports .
when these reports are name le M. action , I am more confiante of M. fact that we feel that des set of political et des recommendations appointments streets our reports were of la value et that M. government should fact hold account .
streets our report sur M. Asia Island Pacific , le Status page of , we we said that Status political foreign keeps account of factors own le promote M. Alternative of des rights of la person , as Status right management of des affairs public , la is et Status society civil , la law of M. right et Status need of a the independent .
la list no est not this , but he there took rather of hold account of these factors prior that we no we engagions streets of des Agreements et of des Relations with of other country .
instead Status page 109 of our report , we we mentioned of des principles of a political Canadian necessary fact equity of rights of la person .
he seat of more fact more obviously that des issues of trade et of Plan no should not be review institution of des rights of la person et of la democracy .
we we indicated streets our report a time introduced Way M. hon. Lloyd Axworthy , streets commentary he took disgraceful that des rights of la person et Status political foreign menaient le a approach the raisonn�e le M. regard of M. trade Covenant et of des affairs Foreign .
Way therefore , as M. Committee M. took mention streets his report , M. trade et M. Plan no are not taken institution .
he must des necessity have with des rights of la person .
he est substantial significant , honourable senators , that M. regions that plans M. government of M. Canada streets M. world determine le a approach fishery , competitive et raisonn�e le M. regard of des rights of la person .
he no must not be des rights of la person of des other issues .
des rights of la person - all our professional of partisan et all des laws .
we must look all des issues .
before M. Committee of des affairs Foreign , des representatives of la new Personnel of M. income were the that they no sons examined that des two issues of M. between taxation et of la opinion taxation , because this est M. mandate who their took summer always .
however , gentleman of des problems , this est that we no we more of Department of M. Revenue .
la new 2 no est not be le des same practices et le des same principles that gentleman Department much must meet .
des employees of M. Department of M. Revenue no were not des same responsibilities le responsibilities .
i conclude means because , streets M. chapter of exempt of his report of November 99 , le Status page 18 , M. Auditor General took disgraceful :
however , I concerned that M. government no retain not considered enough their impact sur la must of account et Status Economy .
from Way their nature , these suffer cancer fact issue des Relations redditionnelles , where des ministers duty account of their policies et programs le M. Parliament et , Way M. directly of M. Parliament , le des citizens fact General .
given given that of des 33 are parts that le these suffer , des ministers no are never fully responsible of themselves .
streets some cases , remembered took intentionnellement established of des suffer of way totally independent of des ministers , although that they qualified or of des fund et of des powers offices .
without must of account et without Economy Kyoto , these suffer can body le Status capacity of M. Parliament of look fact discussion M. use who est eye of des powers offices et of protect M. right of des citizens le a must of account of la share of M. government .
M. Personnel of M. income amounts fact implementation a political taxation .
she est 2.5 of gentleman mandate are et she M. of .
when remembered took donor le these people themselves they themselves concern of issues arise des rights of la person , la Mulroney management of des affairs public et Status capacity section , they were date that they themselves fact remettaient le des Foreign Foreign .
if M. Department of des Foreign Foreign Beauchesne that he there took presence of a relationship found with gentleman government , M. Personnel of M. income themselves fact keeps headed .
means no fact not part of his mandate , for M. deal of M. less .
M. Department of des Foreign Foreign est therefore M. body who should look these country order of see if this est M. kind of country with compete we should authorities of des Agreements international .
from after M. Richard of officials servants of des Foreign Foreign , he est clear that he no exists not le M. within of their Department gentleman process independent et fishery who evidence of determine that des country with compete we concluons of des Agreements for avoid Status opinion taxation are well of des country with compete we wish to et gap our Relations .
M. Senator Opposition Island Staunton took quote M. example of M. Ouzb�kistan .
M. subject of M. Ouzb�kistan no est not around .
M. Ouzb�kistan est still up Way des vestiges of M. Union Soviet .
he took well contribution few change , but he no took not amended reduced his way of run des affairs public .
reflecting there took double of des abuse of des rights of la person et Status situation of des rights of la person est still ceremony fact Ouzb�kistan that means should we people .
Way elsewhere , M. Ouzb�kistan took treaty of des pactes international M. , le meet des rights of M. man .
we we le M. less headed a have that M. country the of inclusion his practices Korea le gentleman control Covenant .
M. Union Soviet him took guide gentleman claim that sur des professional . et political .
this who me concern , this est that person no themselves est know of obtain argument Status situation of des country within streets M. project of bill S Island 3 .
i no know not how of other country , Way example M. house , la Bulgaria , la , , M. Japan , M. Lebanon et M. Luxembourg , run colleagues le M. Ouzb�kistan , et I no know not where they themselves . Way report le a standard World fact equity of rights of M. man .
i no known not des principles or practices who we amounts of determine if becomes or becomes country deserves that we traitions with him .
person no seems bringing , M. problem .
although that I want of agreed with M. principle of des conventions designed le avoid des between respect , I remains place that we no should not majority of country fact particular parliamentarian that we no we caught not set , p good government that we we , of his integrity .
he citing learned of are gentleman country of la list of M. project of bill S Island 3 without bringing le M. pre ' argument all des other with compete we we signed a ceremony agreement .
as remembered M. knows , M. Portugal et M. Luxembourg , Way example , are of des country who , as M. Canada , are members of M. Second et of M. OECD et therefore , we caught relatively clear of their policies .
M. Canada took always taken as reference Status Declaration Human of des rights of M. man et themselves est ' of find des country Way report le a standard results .
we no take nil country particular le payments of example .
when we no the not with gentleman country or when we the of bringing of des Relations with gentleman country , this est that , after M. bringing found according some principles , we meet that this country no took not does le des criteria .
he est clear , of after our analysis of M. project of bill S Island 13 , that M. government no took not established of standards .
M. government no took not therefore des coastal that him had Canadian M. Committee order that he province of des standards .
he citing therefore learned of pointer gentleman country of M. doigt le this stadium .
i no think not that we should find des people et des country le M. strong .
he must find of manner necessary et fishery .
this approval est related le M. Alternative of des rights of la person , le M. principle of M. good government , le Status law of M. right et le M. independence of la the whose I I mentioned .
M. message that we Senator also le our citizens , this est that they must meet Status rule of la opinion taxation et that they must provide of des information financial le gentleman another country .
we must we ensure that , when we , these Agreements who themselves the le des businesses who wonderful two do matter le M. abroad , we doing of means of ensure le this that des information , Way our businesses no recommend not used le of des purpose on et that our citizens no recommend not victims of measures or of treatment who bound some le des standards Forces .
honourable senators , I I raised Status question more of a read , with strength I M. hope .
M. project of bill S Island 3 shows that we no we not successful M. available .
Way therefore , I ask think say that of other country were the also .
we must implement of M. order home we .
M. Minister Foreign talking of a political foreign based sur of des principles .
i request le M. government of M. Canada et le M. Department of des Foreign Foreign of implement these words fact due for that , when we basis before of M. next project of bill fact equity of opinion taxation , des servants qualified we ensure that of des standards obligation et that firms are want Way des country with compete we , des Agreements .
M. hon. Nicholas W . Taylor :
honourable senators , I I share with interest M. Senator Andreychuk , who took spoke of experience .
i am gentleman member recent of M. Committee of des affairs Foreign , but , streets M. framework of my workplace streets M. world of des affairs , I am informed streets a were of country .
i issue that he no est not also easy that he effective of be sitting le M. Senate et of speak of M. sense state et of des rights of la person streets des other country et of purpose their consistent of Alternative of these rights according our own standards .
means me fact think le Status church is of Procruste .
when des asked of la home were too centres for M. question , Procruste their coupait des feet , et themselves they were too small , he their �tirait des members .
instead some Stanbury , distinct M. kind of point that des senators of M. another side compound points ; as Procruste , they common that M. country must themselves serving le our question , resulting of talking we no should not do matter with him .
we must look some aspects as M. Environment et M. trade , et non only 22 of des rights of la person .
instead M. governmental of des years , I I understood that Status wish way of do proceed of good ideas , this est Way M. directly of M. trade .
means George can Island be le M. era where des Portugais were began le themselves tribute fact Africa , p Asia et thus of follow .
M. Senator Andreychuk :
means we took given M. call !
M. Senator Taylor :
yes , gentleman great number of news ideas were also summer import�es streets M. New Parliament .
however , M. trade mind be Status wish way of improve des rights of la person et M. Business tragedy streets each region .
he had of des effects benefit .
reflecting no cannot remarks this who themselves was le M. 16 century le Status situation present .
we we fact of des progress et he seems that we M. must Alberta le M. trade Island et non not because that of des country points that they are best that des other et that they sign of themselves the with of other United le less that these months no become also good that themselves .
this est a way house of deal Status question .
passing he the , but est still fact de�� of M. level up , we should M. encourage fact by le to with him .
however , run he r�gresse et this of des people of rights whose they the a generation certain , we should can Island be using M. trade as gentleman average we allowing of des address le meet more their Environment et des rights of la person .
my Training of g�ologue me because can Island be le think that we must determine themselves they rate or r�gressent .
if gentleman State the , even themselves he no took not still balance our level , he worth can Island be Status worth of to with him .
M. Senator took spoke of M. Ouzb�kistan .
we we caught outstanding all two streets this part of M. world .
this no est can Island be not a right idea of choose this country because that he themselves wherever le side of M. Afghanistan , who est gouvern� Way gentleman regime taliban .
i put same M. Canada le M. challenge of be very the themselves he had of des Care talibans le his border , patrouillant des collection .
no let not des problems who our M. government of M. Ouzb�kistan .
he no took not le , M. Allan with of des groups the et . as des Tories , des so Island are or des Liberals ; his situation est everything another .
Way therefore , he est gentleman little learned of say that he should using M. same system .
surely , I am of notice that M. Ouzb�kistan fact of des progress fine .
for bringing past of M. time fact Iran et fact Afghanistan , I am fact extent of say that M. Ouzb�kistan est fact earlier sur themselves of several years Island jung le some Stanbury .
for fact back le our regarding , he seat difficult of purpose des progress back .
we no can that trying of determine if these country rate et we remind M. importance historic of M. trade since of des time imm�moriaux .
if M. remembered our le des Ministers chronic grecs who �crivaient sur M. impact of la Gr�ce fact Africa , remembered Presentation that this est M. trade who took licences le Status culture et le des ideas of themselves propager of a region le M. another .
he must bringing confidence et grounds that if des ideas et des effects are good , this are firms who finiront Way life , rather that of des ideas et of des effects funestes who compound that a society r�gresse sur M. plan of M. Alternative of des rights of la person .
from way general , honourable senators , despite few reculs here et headed , M. humanity seems financial et this est le M. trade that she M. must .
he sometimes sometimes that she M. long le des shared , namely prior , namely after , but M. trade engaged almost always Status way Status more effective et Status more impartiale of do I des ideas et des effects .
i no am not of agreed with these persons or these groups who trying of we say , here le M. Canada , that we no should not deal with gentleman country remains because that he no balance not some standards .
i continues of grounds that le term term , M. trade letter M. Canada et M. world best .
M. Senator Andreychuk :
honourable senators , M. Senator Taylor , he of answer le a issue ?
M. Senator Taylor :
surely , even if I am very positions this subject .
M. Senator Andreychuk :
i am 800 that means no participate not many of his time .
M. Senator we presented gentleman point that I I heard he there took five years fact organization of M. government who opinion that he must be M. trade of la question of M. Alternative of des rights of la person .
more recently however , M. Minister Foreign took clear established that he there took gentleman direct between M. trade et des rights of la person .
M. Senator took proper le just payments a idea with commentary I am everything le fact of agreed , this est Island le Island say that he compensated trying of see if gentleman country themselves down or fact of des efforts for themselves improve le M. chapter of des rights of la person , or themselves he r�gresse streets this area .
my issue understand two the .
everything of first , M. Senator no believes Island he not that Status political of M. government of lier des two areas est just ?
second , no est Island he not of notice that Status standard whose I the home le M. principle that he had earlier , this est Island le Island say of determine if gentleman country the or r�gresse streets M. file of des rights of la person ?
M. Senator Taylor :
honourable senators , I am pleased that M. Senator lack that we must assessment compensation des country who the et rate et those who r�gressent or suppriment of des rights .
surely , M. weapon service of M. trade , this are des sanctions .
we we had remedy le des sanctions trade fact Africa , Joe some say that firms no were not had many of effects the .
we we had remedy le des sanctions fact Bosnia ; this est this who took transition M. problem of M. Kosovo streets a 800 extent .
i no wish not bringing M. surprised of gentleman and , but I no is not also ever M. trade et des rights of la person that no M. fact our Minister of des Foreign Foreign , according M. hon. Senator .
i no am not realized le this developed .
let gentleman little our relationship with la China .
our trade trade with la China are many et this trade we states many of money , but Status standard the le this country seems on of similar that we are for M. Ouzb�kistan , where we no achetons that few cuirs et peaux .
otherwise said , we must ensure le this that a economy important streets some regions no greater not all kind of effects d�l�t�res .
i think everything of same that M. trade est Status wish way of improve of types reduced .
M. Minister of des Foreign Foreign no me took not evident that a region whatever themselves est better broad because that we recall implemented end le our trade trade with she .

Luxembourg , p view of avoid des between respect et of advise M. between taxation fact equity of taxes sur M. income .
M. hon. John Lynch Island Staunton ( Chief of M. Opposition ) :
honourable senators , I thank M. Senator Cools of this consent to , that I consideration enormous .
M. Senator Andreychuk took fact yesterday gentleman great presentation sur des problems reflect M. project of bill S Island 3 took given held .
as his comments were summer well life , I me bring very short .
instead M. risk of letter some of his comments , I wish simply negative this who took fact M. subject of M. debate .
honourable senators , he est very may that gentleman project of bill sur a sign taxation firm parliamentarian of time .
i think that this est because that we we now charged le proceed of M. weeks financial of des include le 22 of des rights of la person .
this est a something sur commentary remembered insistera , I M. hope , with des years .
M. government no can little that him Island even for M. interest particular that we we bringing le this project of bill , because that his of of breffage was job .
M. the of breffage Authorize sur M. project of bill was M. gentleman of des best , lead M. better , that I appointment never have .
i like credit des chronic of M. the of bringing contribution a ceremony assistance le those who themselves int�ressaient le M. project of bill .
honourable senators , we we given of M. governmental le . le M. Leader Deputy of M. government when we we direct for that M. project of bill either out le M. Committee of des affairs Foreign then that he the Island le just payments le this payment Island headed Island for that he either out le M. Committee of des banks , as this was Status . .
M. Leader Deputy took comprehensive fact evidence of hundreds fact allowing that M. project of bill either out le des two committees .
this was something little , et unsettling le this payment Island headed , but , r�trospectivement , I think that enough took summer gentleman fiscal good .
M. Committee of des banks took carefully des conventions tax firms Island executory , et M. Committee of des affairs Foreign themselves est interested more particular le des country bring Island le gentleman country fact particular Island et le Status way whose M. Canada , streets his political foreign , pregnant remedy fact consideration Status question of des rights of la person for determine his Relations with some country .
i estimated that these projects of bill should rather be either le M. Committee of des affairs Foreign because that , of more fact more , la arguments respecting le des conventions tax honourable sur des country themselves Island executory rather that sur la nature of des conventions .
these recent are all enough powers .
firms are francophone le avoid Status opinion taxation et M. the tax .
this est this that we we effor�ons of determine fact bad gentleman cases particular of M. Ouzb�kistan , gentleman country whose M. subject rest enough mitig� .
i no could not this that I I already said meetings of M. debate of second reading , but this no est not gentleman country with cetera I like do of des affairs or that I like visit streets M. state present of des things .
la response that we we obtenue no est not very certainly , of M. less for me .
gentleman of des witnesses hour Way M. Committee of des affairs Foreign was Status record of des rights of la person , of des affairs decision et of M. equality of des women streets M. world , le M. Department of des Foreign Foreign et of M. Trade Covenant .
his response took summer Status significant :
from gentleman developed of view Museum , M. Canada no est not gentleman expect enough countries for that le him single gentleman country le change his practices fact equity of rights of la person fact him sets of des sanctions use .
even of des sanctions Japan well tell no are not always particular effective .
she took sworn stated that , far le now , M. Canada no had purpose that des sanctions d�cid�es Way des United Voluntary .
he there took great of r�alisme streets this well , but he there took too , I fact I well fear , gentleman renoncement le des principles .
that gentleman country either growers et no retain that a impact marginale Island this who no est not M. cases of M. Canada Island finding he took certain principles , he no should not fear of des implement of M. prior et of des meet .
this est this that we needs of obtain of M. Committee et of des servants of des Foreign Foreign .
yesterday , M. Senator Taylor took donor if we - m�langer rights of la person et trade .
i no share not this developed of view .
some persons common that M. commitment est Status key .
i think that M. the et des boycotts can bringing more of effect .
yet headed , this est a position can the for M. payment .
as M. Senator Andreychuk M. took fact yesterday , we want only well do raises that , when we concluons of approval include , we no can not we talk of no look that gentleman proposals distrait sur la situation of des rights of la person streets M. country fact suffer .
as M. Senator Grafstein M. took resigned le M. Committee of des affairs Foreign , every year , M. the of State American being a analysis research sur M. subject of almost all des country of M. world le M. chapter of des rights of la person .
this analysis est Way Status follow failed le M. administration et le M. Congress , who fact care then le their thought .
we no to not grant tree of importance le this kind of workplace streets this country .
he no themselves branch not of I this who themselves fact elsewhere , but rather of using des means available for do apply des principles that we we tried of adopt fact this who took truck le des rights of la person .
as some of our colleagues M. know , I sworn M. intended of novo of des amendments completed Status country of M. Ouzb�kistan of M. project of bill , but I think that I I summer sure .
after bringing heard M. Senator Andreychuk et des other , I issue that he no citing not just le this developed Island side of deal gentleman country of way different et of M. p�naliser without bringing support of first more of information .
however , now that Status question took summer raised , I hope that of des measures manage taken for that when where M. time of implement le M. developed of new include taxation , des responsible . their analysis more far that Status Letter much of gentleman dealt et that they will account of M. subject of this country fact equity of rights of la person prior of determine of our commitment .
des rights of la person no should not be M. single regarding of consideration , but he est number that they should do M. subject of a consideration more minitieuse that similar that remembered him receive now .
M. hon. Jerahmiel S . Grafstein :
M. Senator est Island he prepared le accept a colleague issue ?
M. Senator Opposition Island Staunton :
although sure .
M. Senator Grafstein :
i am of agreed fact principle sur everything this that M. hon. Senator took demagogic le M. regarding of M. fact that M. government no consistent not intervene des rights of la person streets his political et of la possibility of the would these two elements of way le exercise a press legal sur gentleman State fautif .
M. hon. Senator took he then , Way example , le do adopt a resolution le Status chamber who consistent whether le Status delegation Canadian representations of M. OSCE that M. Senate of M. Canada no est not does of M. subject of des rights of la person streets gentleman country given , let M. Ouzb�kistan , et who absent Status delegation of problem his will le M. OSCE for debate ?
instead a environment more small , his concerns , that I share , thereby be raised le a gallery internationale where , with of la her legal , he citing possible of rallier of other United le these moment .
M. Senator Opposition Island Staunton :

she no me was not voice le M. spirit , but I difficult pleased of there give follow .

i wish le remind le des honourable senators that he no there took not of powers indicate ' le des Nisga' determined .
des laws federal et provincial themselves the le des lands nisga' determined fact same time that des laws nisga' determined .
means ressemblera le this who themselves fact sur des other territories of M. Canada where des Canadians are subject le Status introduce federal , Comments , municipale or regional .
streets this kind of model , of des rules of priority are necessary for establish this who putting themselves proceed fact cases of find or of the between two laws found .
M. dealt nisga' took 50 some rules of priority streets each cases where M. government nisga' took colloquium of des powers indicate .
for that des laws nisga' determined pollutants found , firms must meet these rules of priority .
firms must themselves plier le gentleman number number of other class .
from first et prior everything , firms must be ensure le Status Constitution of M. Canada , there including Status Charter Canadian of des rights et Freedoms .
firms must be also ensure le Status Constitution nisga' took .
honourable senators , I wish mention clear that des powers that I just of mention le M. regarding of la basic nisga' took no include not M. right of take of des laws regarding M. immigration , la basic Canadian , M. no fact parliamentarian that first le des words of la Act sur des Indian or Status possibility of restrictions le M. Canada or le Status British Island British M. accountability of offer of des rights or of des benefits .
reflecting M. specific very clear streets M. dealt nisga' took .
finally , he est of des areas where des interests of des other Canadians biological be reduced et directly RCMP Way Status bill nisga' took , but where M. interest Public est therefore everything fact interesting le des authorities local gentleman number power .
streets this third class , des laws federal et provincial priment sur la bill nisga' took .
des laws federal et provincial primeraient thus streets des areas of la protection of M. Environment , of M. order Public , of la peace et of la security , of des services of health , of des services social , of des ships et of des work Public , of la foreign safety et of des safety , of la give of des mariages , of la sales of des products of la whaling et of la fishing , et of la regulatory of des marine intoxicantes .
he no fact nil doubt that M. government nisga' took bill streets M. framework legal et legislative parliamentarians , et streets M. Alternative of la Constitution Canadian et of la Charter of des rights et Freedoms .
honourable senators , des Nisga' determined a streets Status Mackenzie of la Nass since of des centuries already prior M. arrived of des colleagues .
we know that their society was well sixth , the et Economy Way of des rules of conduct social et of responsibilities shown Status community .
M. Main how of this dealt took summer of Asian Status culture et M. system of government own le des Nisga' determined le Status culture et le M. system of la majority .
as I M. I said everything le M. hour , this est gentleman arrangement practice .
honourable senators , M. gentleman of des major objectives of des negotiations of des include fact British Island British est of create of des certitudes fact this who relative des rights of des aboriginal Way report le des rights of des governments federal et provincial , et of la population Canadian .
M. Agreement the nisga' took party regard objective .
he engaged a definition full et clear of des concern of des Nisga' determined facing le des rights et welfare aboriginal .
thanks le regard agreed , et as he est expected streets M. project 28 C Island 9 , these rights manage or facility .
instead M. future , we basis fact extent of using M. agreed the for objective specific des rights of des Nisga' determined .
each of between we declaration using M. agreed the because that M. dealt provides that he can serve non only le M. government et le des Nisga' determined , but le everything M. world .
he est significant for des groups of businesses et des groups good of la British Island British that Status situation either clear .
from des groups having of des interests also various that M. average board et M. Congress of M. workplace of M. Canada were fact whether le M. Committee Standing of la chamber that Status specifically was le Status Basic of their support le this dealt et le Status signed of include fact General .
M. mayor of la city of Terrace , Jack Talstra , took demagogic le M. Committee Standing :
we the all our wish le our neighbours nisga' determined .
moving of M. prior with this dealt .
honourable senators , otherwise said , he must tell des rights of des aboriginal for ensure gentleman future economic strong for Status British Island British .
instead M. future , des Nisga' determined telecom fact extent of yesterday des lands nisga' determined .
des businesses who themselves interest le des potential of development economic sur des lands nisga' determined politicians that des Nisga' determined are school of these lands .
this est this that means M. text of M. one of M. agreed Final who specific that M. agreed must measures a specifically regarding Status ownership et M. use of des lands et of des resources .
those who themselves face le M. Agreement Final nisga' took danger of we do meaning means .
i saying le my little of la British Island British that means no est not acceptable .
gentleman report realized Public fact 1991 Way Price Waterhouse reach le Status concluded that des concern land non r�solues fact British Island British sons cost le Status province 1 billion of million fact investments et 1 500 jobs streets des recommendation areas of des Forestry et of des mines .
M. cost for des aboriginal est also very high fact reason of des do who themselves second sur their potential of development economic .
accordingly the of gentleman agreed the et " regarding all des concern nisga' determined le M. regard of des rights et welfare aboriginal , des Nisga' determined close gentleman claims who understand 196,1 million of million 7 sur a period of 15 years et gentleman territory of approximately 2 40,000 kilometres comes streets Status Mackenzie of la Nass , transfer who right des rights of regional et of exploitation of M. Subcommittee Island soil et also gentleman right of cueillir a share of M. now of benefits of la Ottawa Nass et of des animals would of la region of la Nass .
however , no . not medical le des comments tendancieux of some who law that he there speaks gentleman transfer fact species of more of 500 million of million .
this no est participate not M. cases .
who can up fully this that represents for des Nisga' determined M. fact of rely sur gentleman would the strong ?
des Nisga' determined serious that regard agreed their give Status possibility , thanks le des efforts that they consentiront et le their skills , of become own sur M. plan economic .
a the nisga' took government exercerait gentleman huge effect multiplicateur sur M. together of M. economy of M. North Island 220 of la British Island British as M. knows M. mayor of Terrace .
from M. notice of some about Island place , he then better allowing le des courts M. experts of themselves deal sur des concern aboriginal .
this est a wrong determination .
he citing on�reux et vorace of time of heard le des courts for look each claims of gentleman right or of gentleman payments aboriginal for each place fact British Island British .
streets M. matter Delgamuukw , la Court Supreme of M. Canada took precedent of des regime of M. remedy le des courts et address that Status departments joint Status wish way of deal these problems .
some of between you themselves party can Island be that M. matter Delgamuukw est life during ten years before des courts et that , p across of - , la Court Supreme of M. Canada took Second Status held of gentleman new refer .
he rest still of M. uncertainty ownership le des rights aboriginal of des Gitskan et Wet' suwet' fact who were the le this matter .
la specifically who themselves the of M. dealt nisga' took maniac clear des benefits of la departments Way report le M. remedy le M. tribunal .
for 50 M. objective would le go a solution practice et being , M. Agreement the nisga' took measure of des Customs strong with specifically this that he fact est of la ownership et of M. use of des lands et resources streets Status Mackenzie of la Nass .
he est very significant of negative that M. everything themselves est one streets M. framework legal Museum .
des negotiations of M. Agreement the nisga' took no sons not for subject of definition des rights of des Nisga' determined , but rather le implement end le M. uncertainty fact explicitant , of la way Status more clear et Status more specific possible , all des rights confidence le M. section 35 that des Nisga' determined able exercise a read that M. Agreement the nisga' took colloquium summer signed .
streets M. past , M. Canada took Bachelor a form of specifically fact the of des rights aboriginal non d�finis against of des rights d�finis the of include Way M. remedy le of des words as " home " or " doing " .
des concerns of des Nations First le this technical of la Tax the M. indicate Main le Status concluded of include good .
M. Agreement the nisga' took resolution a approach health sur la " amendment of des rights " .
according M. approach Prime of M. right aboriginal amended , des rights aboriginal of des Nisga' determined , there including M. payments , subsistent , but rather , pursuant le des work . et other set streets M. Agreement the nisga' took .
means took summer realized possible thanks le M. agreed of des three parts et le M. fiscal of des powers indicate of des governments federal et provincial .
thus therefore , all des rights aboriginal that des Nisga' took right Subcommittee M. regime of the the manage rather et every Status form of des rights set streets M. Agreement the nisga' took .
la technical designed le promote Status specifically going therefore Way M. fundamental of des rights rather that their preference .
if , p despite of M. Agreement the et of la Act sur M. Agreement the nisga' took , he est gentleman right aboriginal another that des rights of M. section 35 of la dealing nisga' took piece streets M. Agreement the nisga' took or whose des of are different , this right eliminated many le rely of la valid of novo fact effect of la bill .
accordingly under of la new approach le M. regard of des rights aboriginal , des recommendation rights that lend des Nisga' determined fact under of M. section 35 bound those set streets M. Agreement the .
honourable senators , I think that we can see des Iraq , des Customs et Status business of des different points of view who amounts Status departments of the good et r�alisables le M. regard of issues difficult .
M. fact that des businesses , des groups who were of des interests streets des resources , des governments ports et des from support M. new model of des rights shows that M. remembered took held account of their interests le Status Contents of des negotiations .
several left et friend of M. Agreement the nisga' took feeling no not be t Way des facts .
instead M. held of means , they d�forment Status truth for do vibrer of des from sensibles fact view of desire a reaction if of la share of M. Public .
des senators are le M. aware of this who themselves est past streets M. another place where M. Opposition official , M. Party Reform , took 1972 of M. do .
honourable senators , gentleman of des criticism the of this dealt est M. Chief of M. Opposition official fact British Island British , Mr. the then .
this last took strictly follows streets his memories le M. Committee Standing of M. another place :
des people of Cosmos Island British want of des include who concilient des rights of des Peoples aboriginal protection Way Status Constitution with la went of la Crown .
they want used of des raise because that means est comes le of des raise , Way of des courts .
honourable senators , this est informed this that we we fact .
Mr. . M. claims that Status Act sur M. Agreement the nisga' took written gentleman new order of government le M. Canada et that , Way therefore , he represents a amendment le Status Constitution who must be failed le Status population of la British Island British Way seaway of wishes Subcommittee M. regime of la bill Comments fact effect order of obtain M. approval of la majority .
he took meeting a partisan for do intervene des courts et fact obtain a deals .
des parts le M. agreed et des . who were agreements meetings of hearings proposed serious that M. partners Mr. then no took nil touchstone constitutional .
i like provide of new M. Minister of des Foreign Indian et of M. North Museum who , p themselves the le M. another place M. 26 October last , took demagogic :
M. Agreement nisga' took est of a vast importance et he regardless of negative that he took summer signed streets M. framework constitutional present of M. Canada .
M. Agreement nisga' took est gentleman arrangement practice who 2 des rights that Status dealing nisga' took exercera le des words of M. section 35 of la Act section of section .
these rights manage certainly protection fact under , section 35 , but means no means not that they manage absolus .
des courts were Annual that these rights can be enfreints if means themselves only .
honourable senators , M. dealt nisga' took specific this who following :
M. Agreement no amend not Status Constitution of M. Canada , consumer Status independent of des powers between M. Canada et Status British Island British .
M. 23 November , then that M. leading about Hogg et M. university Patrick Monahan , of la Faculty of right and during , t�moignaient before M. Committee Standing of M. another place , M. university Monahan took demagogic follows :
therefore , p big , my position est that lesparagraphes 35 agreed 1 ) et 35 agreed 3 ) of la Constitution into specific M. process who est fact emerging of themselves d�rouler , le whether that gentleman agreed est signed between gentleman peoples aboriginal , M. government federal et abolished or a province .
more far , M. university Monahan add :
means no means not that des Agreements fact break compound part of la Constitution of M. Canada , but rather that des rights who fact 12 are protection et that whole bill , federal or Comments , who citing step le des rights the of M. dealt examined e le M. Carstairs of session set Way des courts when gentleman right full Way M. section 35 est according , specifically who took summer set streets M. matter Sparrow .
accordingly give , honourable senators , none streets M. project 28 C Island 9 no took Status lower impact sur la independent of des powers set le M. government federal et le des provinces Way Status Constitution Museum .
their power legislative remains that .
he no fact nil doubt that this issue worded which gentleman day Way of des authorities more senior plac�es that Right that I just of provide .
reflecting points also le M. project of bill of be seen sur la family .
Way example , M. Dr. to Martin , MP Reform of Esquimalt Island Juan of Fuca took written streets gentleman section parule 24 November 99 streets M. The editor Ottawa Citizen :
we the gentleman Stratton of that et of des Society who once M. Africa of M. South of M. time of M. the .
streets M. same section , he Auditor this who following :
he must also there bringing a bill for all .
however , le M. during of M. G that I I having everything le M. hour , M. university Bradford Morse , of la Faculty of right of M. University of Ottawa , took demagogic :
la question research who the le well of des criticism , this est that des aboriginal no are not recognized as gentleman group separate fact under of la family , but , as Status court Supreme of des United Island United M. took direct clear le ground again during le M. less 170 years , some Peoples facilities their own territories since of des time imm�moriaux , p parliamentarian that First provincial having their own systems legal , cultural , whereas , language et political ... this who amendments their difference as 6 policies , et non as groups raciaux .
honourable senators , des rights set le des Nisga' determined fact under of M. section 35 of our Constitution are good sur their presence prior M. arrived of des colleagues streets Status Mackenzie of la Nass , et non sur of des reasons . , as some M. were guide hear .
this self policy thought of des rights good sur la presence prior M. arrived of des colleagues et she est step designed for that des rights et des interests of des other Canadians , p particular those who living streets Status region Funds , recommend include right .
all des rights le Status ownership private are fully protection .
all des rights le Status ownership provided sur of des lands nisga' determined bomb M. subject of worked , or own .
all des laws federal et provincial themselves the , there including des laws provincial who no themselves apply not streets des item Indian .
otherwise said , he there speaks more of the for Status woman nisga' took , Way example , who no themselves apply not currently according Status Act sur des Indian et M. system of des item Indian .
Way therefore , he there took privileged of . potential of officers of des hand sur all des issues substantielles .
from elsewhere , this process of tabled themselves est finally showed be M. more hard et effective of whole M. history of des include le M. Canada .
streets his memories , and then took too fact reference le some " concerns related le M. equality streets M. dealt nisga' took " , leaving hear that Status rule of right no eliminated not the uniform�ment le all des Columbians of la British Island British et that those Island side no manage not include also le M. domestic of M. Canada .
M. point supporting that all des Columbians of la British Island British equipped informed des same rights no 4 not le des provisions Constitutional who provisions of des rights duty for some groups .
this developed of view nierait le des Nisga' determined all des rights the of include et give le hear also that he no should not there bringing of rights aboriginal .
accordingly addition , this developed of view the all des other rights duty protection Way Status Constitution as des rights of des minorities , des rights le M. education et des rights language .
honourable senators , des Nisga' determined no should not bringing le doing le their culture et le their French for living streets our beautiful country .
he est possible , le M. Canada , of be le Status read aboriginal et Museum .
M. time no me allows not of deal many of des issues raised Way this dealt historic where M. right le M. self policy of gentleman peoples aboriginal est , for Status first read , whereas Way M. Parliament fact under of M. section 35 .
from well of des ways , des rights of des non Island Nisga' determined air fact territory nisga' took minor am�lior�s Way M. material of des restrictions cut Way Status Act sur des Indian .
accordingly equity of rate , des Nisga' determined were accept , p short , that their peoples come of des taxes as all des other Canadians after a 800 period .
step le their development economic , des Nisga' determined assumeront a responsibility value of their own funding .
they document with look of power themselves whom of la legislative financial .
honourable senators , I I very look that we the M. debate sur M. project of bill C Island 9 .
i think that , when we M. close examined le investigate , we M. the with enthusiasm .
i think that Terry Glavin , gentleman member of M. Pacific fishery Resource Conservation international , of la British Island British , took very well give Status situation when he took retired Status parolele 17 November last before his citizens of la British Island British et took demagogic :
i no doubt not that Status broad majority of des about Island place that M. objective of la concluded , with des Nations First , of include who recommend taken et access et who compound honour le Status Crown .
more far , he took further :
accordingly thought of �pilogue , honourable senators , I wish le negative that few senators behalf today today were shown gentleman role using le M. within of M. Committee Joint of la chamber of des House et of M. Senate sur la Constitution fact risks Island 1981 , who took held of des hearings et discussion sur this that est became Status Act section of section .
this naturally a period historic le M. during of commentary Status Charter of des rights , M. the of la Constitution et of many other issues important were , together , change Status nature of M. Canada , et fact right part for M. better , le my notice .
M. section 35 account among des provisions important having summer various le this payment Island headed .
gentleman number number of senators et of MPs were �prouv� a vast origin when M. Minister of la Assistance of M. era , Jean Chr , Subcommittee Status press huge of M. Committee Joint , took recipient , le M. behalf of M. government Trudeau , of add M. section 35 le Status Constitution .
M. project of bill C Island 9 represents M. gentleman of des major results of our efforts of M. era .
M. Committee Joint was constitutional Way fire M. Senator Harry Hays et Way gentleman fringant MP of M. Quebec , became since M. fringant Senator Joyal .
i the then M. government le M. Senate , decreased that M. former Senator my my first M. Opposition .
M. gentleman of des members committees of M. another place whose M. attendance was around was Eymard Corbin , today today Senator .
that M. remembered me pardonne if I I Commerce of mention who that this either le M. Senate who took 30 le this Committee le payments of Gaulle Standing .
accordingly go , I bring late that gentleman Senate whose some of des members committees more of 20 years of experience took ship a contribution proposal le contribute fact equity of political policy .
M. hon. rald Island A .
honourable senators , tariffs agreed Island because he themselves branch well of gentleman agreed , et non of gentleman dealt Island est then le Status Constitution , le Status Charter of des rights et le M. Code criminal .

thus , la Francophonie est exerc�e the Way M. Parliament of M. Canada , and Way des down legislation provincial .
M. system operating very well .
i I heard say that Island et you me corrigerez if I me through Island streets some cases , this who fact competition le Status Francophonie no est of jurisdiction nor federal nor Comments ; means means can Island be say that he there took of M. flou something share streets M. agreed .
streets Status extent where M. agreed no amend not M. share of des powers between Ottawa et des provinces , I am does .
est Island this M. cases ?
M. Senator Austin :
i wish thank M. Senator Beaudoin of his issue .
as I M. I said streets my speech , he there took series clause particular who specific that regard agreed no visit fact nothing Status independent of des powers between M. Canada et Status British Island British .
thus , he there took M. section 35 we des rights confidence streets regard agreed .
these rights receive a protection section , but means no visit fact nothing Status independent of des powers .
la Constitution , namely of M. agreed between M. government federal et des provinces , qualified des rights of des aboriginal a read that M. Parliament et Status British Island British were UN M. agreed le M. average of a bill .
M. Senator Beaudoin :
i no I participate nil problem with M. section 35 , because he give of des rights - le des aboriginal streets Status Constitution of M. Canada .

M. government can same create of des item exclusives of fishing , this who est plan streets M. dealt nisga' took .
as remembered M. specific streets M. section 7 , means must themselves do Way M. adoption of a extent legislative rules .
M. dealt provides a RCMP of fishing alone who eliminated then prot�g�e fact under of M. section 35 of la Constitution .

M. hon. Senator to ) .
M. hon. Joan to :
honourable senators , when I rise Status speak here le Status chamber , I trying fact General of using des two languages official .
today today however , I me exprimerai fact English only for the my Senators le similar of all those who exhortent M. government of M. Ontario le adopt a bill deal that Status new vast city of Ottawa eliminated record the .
i me adresserai le you fact English only because that I think that he est significant of recognize that this est a issue who relative all des Canadians , des French , des francophones , those that we so le M. Quebec des the et des aboriginal , that they speak des two languages official or only a or same no of des two .
he there took good number of reasons for reasons Status city of Ottawa , et not only Status region of la important national who do le M. government federal , should be record the .
la first , who themselves i le M. plan unemployment , this est that gentleman great number of francophones there living , over 40,000 I think .
i know this that means means of see his own government need le recognize Status good of his community language , his right le be Land le share full for this that she est , this est Island le Island say gentleman attribut of gentleman of des Peoples behind of this country .
i know this that means means of hear his government Comments say something something of M. kind " Regardez as we you the well .
you this be both for all these good things that we advanced for you .
no whether especially not le be recognized for this that you intervention .
no you but not le this that remembered you receive of des rights .
whatever heart fact , Island remembered ?
means fact difficulty , honourable senators .
means you give M. heart that home you , streets your own province , no intervention not considered as gentleman real le share full same if your from were contributed le build this country et that Status Constitution lack your French as M. a of des two languages official of M. country .
honourable senators , we know all that , since a generation , des governments . the , there including M. government present , were worked of des efforts of for implement sur feet et offer gentleman broad economic of services of fran fran et for help des francophones le build et le function their graduate regarding essential .
although that we regrettions can Island be all deep Status situation le M. two the et that we esp�rions can Island be , as I M. 6 , that she eliminated courts of way certainly , he est also significant of recognize that M. government the present took retired M. initiative of making le des francophones M. control of des schools some .
this no est not nothing .
i fact pay tribute le M. government of M. Ontario .
we , all that we , here , le M. Parliament federal et that , le M. Canada , des enjoy within of la jurisdiction of des provinces .
we know that Status creation of la m�gaville est a matter of jurisdiction Comments .
he no there took useful nil of between we who M. called .
this est also there that Ottawa est gentleman cases Special .
this est a will inquiry , surely , but this no est not a will as des other , because Ottawa et Ottawa miss est Status important national .
la region of la important national no est not Status important .
this est a region , a great region , Richard et that as he must , a wonderful learning cost of M. importance of la important for all des Canadians ; but Ottawa , la city of Ottawa , est Status important .
instead M. Canada , we we two languages official .
this est gentleman weeks basic of our history , of our English as country .
this est gentleman of des agriculture of our identity et of our policies national .
how themselves can Island he that Status important of M. country no should not regulation this fact wonderful ?
maple message means available he le des Canadians , not only le des francophones but le all des Canadians , when we let that , even if we we two languages official , Tibet M. a of firms est really official here , streets Status important she Island even ?
honourable senators , M. spring last , he me took summer given of visit Bruxelles , la important of gentleman country le des taken with of des problems language who rel�guent des May le of des up of children .
i am sure that you know that Status , est the fact cantons French et flamands , but , stating , p practice et of Way his laws , Bruxelles est a city the .
he should fact be thus et we should we fact the .
from such regulation that , if we , for that Status city of Ottawa either the , we must also table for that similar of same M. either also .
means interest gentleman problem of responsible Comments .
accordingly parliamentarian that Qu�b�coise of fran English , I assure hoped the that M. government of M. Quebec receive le same M. status official of city the , as he M. took fact for of other enjoy , there including similar where I opinion .
but means no relative fact nothing Status city of Ottawa .
i am sure , honourable senators , that we we all summer see of learned that Status will of Ottawa took donor le M. government of M. Ontario of recognize le this , Island city M. status of city the .
i think whether that single M. government Comments can recognize this status le a will inquiry .
he there took privileged of des advantage before des courts le regard effect .
we know that some enhanced face a long le this extent .
obviously Status long huge whose I am le M. aware comes of French , et a vast part of Clairvaux long seems themselves express Way Status turn , a turn of des consequences that M. status the of la important national could bringing for des French who on le Ottawa .
although sure , many of people concerned M. change et sometimes , this turn est , ; however , gentleman little of change est change .
gentleman little of change allows of build gentleman future better for our country et for we all , who caught dangerous he of fact be des citizens .
we can happen le embrasser this change .
i looking le my parents , of des French of la Nova Island Nova , credit of their deep , who remontaient le 200 years streets our country .
they no were never mentioned French .
Undeterred that I side , nil of their from no speaking French , M. ga�lique , yes , but not M. French .
when my parents were young , la question of M. Commission et of M. period no pointait same not le M. going .
streets des years 60 , when M. Canada English took finally including regard discussed of M. history , of M. identity et of M. future of our country , my parents were summer among des million of Canadians English le M. understand themselves also et le themselves the of M. identity the et biculturelle of our country .
they no were not learned M. French , but they were fact fact hallmark that I M. apprenne , because they point that all des Canadians who fact sons Status possibility should speak des two languages of M. Canada .
they were proud that I appointment learned M. French .
i their am �ternellement for of me safely bringing offered Status possibility .
why we of des flag , Way example , if M. symbolisme no est not significant ?
M. symbolisme est a something substantial important for we all .
et where est Island this more significant that streets Status important of M. country ?
finally , I orders that if Ottawa no est not a city as des other , M. Ontario est a province not as des other .
she took always contributed le several of des elements of our identity whose we caught if proud Island Status tolerance , M. opening of spirit , M. inclusion whose we we targuons .
i urge therefore M. government of M. Ontario , a read still , of responsibilities his role historic of Chief of leadership .
as we M. we heard fact this visit today today et des days advantage , remembered est fact emerging of study very serious of other due for that Ottawa retain M. status of city the that she deserves , le my notice .
a partisan fact justice est portion Way our colleague , M. hon. Senator Joyal , without doubt M. more infatigable veteran of des rights of des minorities that we do .
he est issue that M. government federal is .
passing he must fact happen headed , that he fact either thus , but he citing dangerous more comes that M. government of M. Ontario consistent this that were fact parliamentarian of his and prior him , that he states his exercise et share its role historic who est of themselves show M. proud the of this that he there took of better le M.
